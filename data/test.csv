"I tried the ""famous"" Mac and Cheese burger at this restaurant and it was a huge disappointment. The burger meat was of highly questionable quality and had an off-putting aftertaste. The mac and cheese itself was not bad, but the burger meat was not worth the price. The apple poppy salad was at least edible. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"The Arlo hotel in Soho is great for budget-minded travelers. The room rate is very reasonable at $200 per night and includes a free gym membership. Additionally, the ""happy hour"" from 530 to 7 every night at the hotel bar offers unlimited Heineken drafts or good quality red or white wine. The hotel has a cool vibe and is frequented by people from all over the United States and also many European guests. I met people from Austria and England while there. The only disappointment was breakfast- it's a fixed price of $25, but the selections are something that I would expect to find at a Holiday Inn Express, not up to New York City standards. Other than that, the hotel was in a great location and impeccably clean and furnished in a very modern and almost Scandinavian design. I highly recommend this hotel in New York.",1
"I thought the lunch specials at this restaurant were decent, but not great. The dishes were a little on the Westernized side, but the flavors were okay. I wasn't overly impressed with the portion sizes, but the food came out fairly quickly. The most expensive lunch special was the shrimp dish, and I wasn't impressed with that either. I would probably come back for a different dish, but not for lunch.",1
"I had a great experience at Covid this morning, thanks in part to the attentive staff. I was a little surprised, however, to see one of the cooks wearing a mask without properly securing it beneath his nose; this is a health and safety hazard, and one that should not be tolerated. However, the staff were all very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be clean. I would definitely recommend Covid to others.",1
"Da Toscano is one of the more unique Italian restaurants I've been to in the West Village. Almost everything on the menu was something I hadn't seen before. I had the focaccia and meatballs to start. Both of which were phenomenal. The pastas we had were good, but definitely not the best in town. The agnolotti wasn't my favorite, but we really enjoyed the orecchiette and the garganelli verde. I wasn't the biggest fan of the broccoli rabe side. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and thought it was a decent spot to start visiting more often.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was slow, but they were nice about it. The food was good, and the atmosphere was cozy. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
I came here for lunch with a friend and we had a great time. The food was really good and the portions were very large. I especially loved their seafood soondubu. It had a lot of seafood and it was really delicious. My friend ordered intestines fried rice and it was also really good. We were both really full after lunch and we couldn't believe how much food we had. I would definitely come back here and I would highly recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"I usually love this place for pizza, rather I consider this one of the best pizza's in NYC! We usually order the cheese pizza with some mushrooms and garlic. It is so far the best thin crust crispy pizza.Unfortunately it wasn't good the last time I went around two weeks back. The presentation was messed up, the sauce tasted so different as well as the pizza wasn't well baked and not crispy either. I ordered the mulled wine as I miss my usual Europe winter trips this year due to pandemic! The mulled wine was presented beautifully but wasn't at all the taste I was looking for. Maybe I have high expectations! I would have loved to give them a 5 star but due to my recent experience I have to take a star off! Our server was very sweet and he gave us a 30% discount as we weren't too happy with the pizza!",0
"I had high hopes for this cafe when it first re-opened, but unfortunately my experience was not as great as I had hoped. The cafe had a clean and cool atmosphere, and the staff were very helpful when we first arrived. However, the food was not very good. The Italian panini bread was tough and the meat was lifeless. The pasta was supposed to be made fresh but resembled canned Chef Boyardee. Additionally, the prices were quite high for the quality of food received. Overall, I felt like we wasted a meal in a city with so many other amazing eatery options.",1
"Hilltop has been bookmarked for quite some time. Last night was the night that we finally decided to remove it and try it out. It's a pretty spacious restaurant with a woody interior and a big bar in the back. You probably wouldn't have to worry about making reservations here due to all the seating (they also have outdoor seating too).Our waitress, Nicole, took our order pretty much right away once we sat down. They have some good cocktails here; the winners in my opinion were the Mayor Dinkins and the Gina Torres. To eat, we ordered the Hilltop Burger and the roasted chicken. The burger was tasty and came with some awesome garlic parm fries. The roasted chicken with the garlic mash was also good too. Everything satisfied our ravenous hunger. The only downside to last night was that the service was SLOW. Like, it took about 15-20 mins for each drink to come out. At the end, we topped off with another order of garlic parm fries and those took over 30 mins to come out too. I think they were just pretty short staffed yesterday. From my observations, there was only one waitress taking care of the whole inside/bar area and there was a waiter tending to the outdoor area. I would return, just definitely on a day/night without any time constraints.",0
"Decided to stop by for a quick meal, didn't realize it was a pretty small restaurant. Ordered the lunch special, the shrimp siu mai and the 6 soup dumplings. Coming from the bay, I did expect something more, either a bigger menu, more flavor and something unique but did not get that here.",0
We have come in here to eat a few times. So far it has been a little bit of a hit or miss situation. The first time it was late at night and the ramen was really good. We had the Koku Ramen without the nori add extra egg and menma. Very tasty. The second time we had the spicy ramen. It was ok. But we got the chicken karage. That was amazing!! Now for today. I ordered the kimchi tan tan ramen. It was just strange. I thought it would be spicy and have kimchi in it. Neither of that was true. But of course we had the chicken karage again. I'm telling you chicken is amazing. Very lightly fried and the sauce it nice and spicy.  Final thoughService is decent. The food is ok. (Except for the karage. That is amazing.),0
"My hunt for authentic Shanghainese food will remain open... unfortunately I don't find this place authentic. I came here with a friend for dinner, we weren't super hungry so we shared an order of soup dumpling and Lions head meatball. Soup dumpling was good, very generic. The lions head meatball (which is a stable in Shanghainese cuisine) was very meh... I've always had the meatballs in a smaller ball whenever my family would make it, but this place served it in a huge ball. The texture was very mushy, and the flavor was bland. Overall, I will only come back and have the soup dumplings IF I'm in the neighborhood and craving Shanghainese food. I wouldn't make my way to Murray hill just for this..",0
"Ivan Ramen is a great place to go for a quick lunch. The wait was only about five minutes, and our food arrived quickly. The chicken was good, but I found it to be a bit sweet for my taste. The pork buns were also good, and the eggplant was a tasty but strange combination of flavors and textures. The outside of the eggplant was crispy, but the inside was almost liquid. The vegan ramen was not great, and we wouldn't order it again. The spicy chili ramen was good, with a nice spice level. The tonkatsu was also very good, and I would definitely recommend it. The portions and prices are what you would expect at a Japanese restaurant, and the service is fast. However, the restaurant is very narrow, so it can be difficult to find a seat.",1
"I went to Meh restaurant for dinner and I was really disappointed. The pizza was really bland and I couldn't even taste the toppings. The service was also really bad. I had to ask for salt shaker and there were no napkins or forks available at our table. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Finally got to try the famous melt shop after hearing so many good things about it! I grabbed the fried chicken sandwich to go along with some tater tots topped with parmesan cheese.The fried chicken sandwich was super tasty and the perfect portion! Getting the tater tots was also the way to go, it was phenomenal as well and a great side to the sandwich! I would come back and try their other sandwiches on their menu.",0
"Pretty much 3.5 stars. Came in for brunch and everything was good, just not great. I had a grapefruit mezcalita to start, which was an appropriate level of boozy. The toro taquitos were nice, not very flavorful. The crunch corn shell overpowered the tuna so I found myself breaking the shell in half to just eat it open face style. We shared the enchiladas Borrachos and the birria tacos. I enjoyed the enchiladas but my boyfriend preferred the tacos. The enchiladas was a sizable portion for $24, stuffed with pulled chicken and I enjoyed the tangy salsa with which they were smothered. The birria tacos were flavorful and the consume was delicious, but idk they left something to be desired for me. For $18 you only get two tacos which feels steep. I wasn't blown away but probably be back to try some other dishes. Still on the hunt for my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. Better options in the outer boroughs for now.",1
"We had reservations for Sunday brunch and were seated right away. The oeuf au plat, which was a baked egg dish with mortadella, comte cheese and crispy baguette, was so unctuous and comforting. My husband ordered the roast chicken and raved it was delicious. The wine served are all natural wines - I tried two different whites that I did NOT like - before I fell in love with the rose. Our server was patient and wanted to make sure that I got a wine that I enjoyed. For dessert, we perused the dessert options, but ended up deciding on the pancake (after hearing another table next to us order a pancake ""for the table""). This was a wonderful decision - the pancake is something you should order - and it is perfect for sharing. Sweet and buttery goodness. Despite all of the hype of this place, our dining experience felt very warm, friendly and easy like a Sunday morning ought to be.",1
Businesses are hit hard by COVID but I'm impressed by the ability of this particular restaurant to maintain their quality during this time. We came here for Saturday Brunch. The deal is ~$20 for an entree and 8 oz cocktail. We ended up ordering a 48 hr flavored cocktail. It was especially made and tasted delicious.Hope to check this place out again soon!,0
"The pizza here is pretty cheesy and very saucy. The crust is a bit thicker than most pizzas, but we liked it! They are supposed to be personal sized, but they are pretty big and enough for 2 people with appetizers. I recommend the meatballs to start and the Buffalo caprese salad.",0
I stopped by today for a quick bite with my wife and was really impressed! The pizza was great - especially for the price. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!,1
"I have been to 108 dry hot pot a few times and believe it is pretty good. They have a decent amount of options for meats and vegetables and the flavor of the food is delicious! it is slightly on the pricier side for a quick lunch, but I would recommend it if you are looking for dry hot pot since I don't know too many other places in the city. hits the spot and the boba shop inside is also a plus!",0
"Recently, I had the chance to dine at Jean-Georges. The restaurant is located on the west side, near Columbus Circle, and it's classically decorated with low lighting. The service was great; our waitstaff was attentive and helpful.

I tried the following dishes:

Toasted Egg Yolk: This dish was definitely the standout of our meal. The egg yolk was meant to taste like a grilled cheese and it was delicious. It was unique and interesting, and I really enjoyed it.

Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons: This dish was also good. The tuna was fresh and flavorful.

Madai Sashimi: I love madai, and this piece was no exception. However, I've had better madai elsewhere.

Chitarra Pasta: This pasta was really well-cooked and rich. It was tasty and enjoyable.

Crispy Black Bass: This bass was okay. It was cooked well, but lacked flavor.

Arctic Char: This char was really nice. It was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.

Overall, I had a really enjoyable dining experience at Jean-Georges. Some of the dishes weren't as original as I had",1
"Overall, I thought this restaurant was pretty decent. The drinks are strong and the appetizers are of good quality. My only complaints are that they only brought out one order of tacos and that the meat in the tacos was a little on the gamey side. All in all, I would recommend it as a nice stop before a show.",1
"Very trendy area, but the food is in small portions and prices are on the more expensive side. We got the lobster mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, chocolate cake, and the wagyu sushi. Everything was very flavorful.I'm giving it a 3/5 because the music was so loud I practically had to yell at my cousin to talk with her. Everything was super dim (pictures are with iphone night mode) and the waiter was nice but we had to call him over a few times because we needed his assistance. Also, the prices for the food.",0
"I recently ordered the burger with gluten-free bread and seasoned french fries. I also got to try the Brussel Sprouts and their cucumber and tomato salad/salsa. The food was delicious and well-cooked. They were also flexible with how they cooked their meat seeing as I ordered it very rare and juicy, which means that the quality of the meat was really good. The delivery was also really fast, and I loved the dining experience.",0
"A tasty but pretty average brunch, although was very popular due to a larger lack of good food in the herald square area. We were seating immediately at 11:45am on a Saturday morning, which is always a gamble. There was a wait to sit outside, but they checked out vaccine cards for indoor seating and had the doors open and air circulating so it felt very comfortable. The food was good but semi-average brunch type food. The nova eggs Benedict came on fried latkes which were too greasy and heavy to compliment the rest of the meal. The ricotta lemon pancakes were really good, though. Fluffy and sweet. The $7 mimosas were the best part of the meal, although our first round and second round varied greatly in size. The only big annoyance was how loud it was inside, specifically from the guy clearing tables. He was literally smashing plates together into this bucket he was carrying and it was so distracting when trying to hold a conversation.",0
"Topaz Noodle Bar is my go-to spot for Thai takeout. Its sister restaurant next door, Topaz Thai Authentic, is similar, but Noodle Bar's menu is more expansive, offering a wider variety of noodles (as expected) and fried rice; they also have green, yellow, red, and Panang curries, in addition to other traditional Thai specialties.I'm partial to the Gaeng Kiew Warn, a coconut milk-based green curry with vegetables, namely bamboo shoots, bell peppers, eggplant, and string beans, as well as basil leaves. Out of the available protein add-ins, I usually opt for tofu. The green curry is always flavorful and a bit spicy; it could be spicier, but that's just my personal preference - most people would probably be content with the current spice levels. It wasn't too salty, either, a good indication that they don't feel the need to overcompensate for a lack of natural flavor. The ingredients, particularly the vegetables, are fresh, and it shows. Portion sizes are reasonable, and I never find myself hungry again until several hours later.Admittedly, I have yet to dine in, so I can't speak to that experience. However, Topaz's takeout service is consistently quick and efficient. I don't think I've ever had to wait longer than thirty minutes after placing my order for it to be ready for pickup, even on the restaurant's busier nights.I consider this place a neighborhood staple, and would recommend it to anyone in Midtown who's in the mood for Thai food.",0
"I bought 2 rice rolls, gave one to my parents.. they haven't had this style of rice roll in ages.. 30 years ago, they were .40 or so and pretty tiny. $2.50 wasn't too bad each, considering the size. It's like a small burrito. They do give a generous amount of meat, lots of green onions, dried shrimp. I didn't really think I'd like it but it's got good flavor, loved the green onions. It is greasy which keeps the rice rolls from sticking together, I added my own chili sauce. They gave packets of hot sauce but chili sauce adds more flavor. They only sell 3 items, a bit limited but the food was tasty and fresh. The rice rolls weren't mushy at all, great texture. They didn't even dry out after I left them sitting in a bowl for at least a few hrs since I was busy and forgot I took it out of the box. Microwaved it for less than a min just to get it a bit warm and it was great.",0
I usually only come here for the rice clay pots and the steamed rice noodles. The bbq in the window isn't my favorite location (the bbq pork is too sweet). The pork and preserved egg congee is good but it's odd that they use minced pork. The fried chicken wings are miniature and not good at all for the price.,1
"This is a chain from the UK. I booked thru Seated. They had a 18% cash back surge. I was disappointed with the food. It's not bad but it's also not worth the price. Price - $20 for ramen, $16 for salad, $8 for the baosFood - For $20, the ramen was super small / barely had noodles. My friend consumed it with 4 bites (essentially) and the duck was dry. The salad was okay. It tasted like the seared tuna salad from Cheesecake Factory but with rice and smaller portion. The Bao barely had pork belly. The pork belly was the size of my thumb. It was mostly the fried apple. The food was very westernized. Service - The service was good. Without it, I'll probably only give this place 1 star. The waitress was attentive and gave suggestions on the menu.",0
The Bilao restaurant is a great place to go for Filipino food. The service is friendly and the food is delicious. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is cozy. I would definitely recommend Bilao to anyone looking for a good Filipino meal.,1
"Came here on a Saturday night with some friends. When we arrived at 7:30 there weren't too many people there but it got pretty crowded really quick and there ended up being a wait for tables, so I'd recommend a reservation just in case. I can only really speak for the soup dumplings, but they were really good. I tried some of the fish in chili oil that my friends got and the sauce was definitely flavorful, although it was super oily. I don't eat this type of food much so maybe that's normal and I just don't realize it, however it wasn't my favorite. I'm basing my review solely based on the soup dumplings I ate and service/atmosphere since I didn't eat much of anything else they had. Service was fine, although at times it was pretty slow, it took a while to order and then when we were finished it took a long time to get the check. The atmosphere is fine, it's pretty plain but it's clean so can't complain too much, but if you're looking for ambiance this isn't it. I'd recommend trying this if you like this type of food, my friends eat this all the time and said this place is really good so I'm going to go ahead and trust them and give 4 stars, that and because I did like the soup dumplings.",0
I was really pleased with my meal at Amici. The food was delicious and the service was great. The calamari appetizer was especially good! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.,1
"I was nearby and wanted to eat something for lunch before I headed to a concert. I found this place through yelp. I haven't had soba for so long so I decided to visit this place and I am so glad I did!I was lukewarm about soba in the first place but the soba from this restaurant made me forget about all the others. That was how amazing the soba here was.I was promptly seated and given the menu. I decided to try the spicy Thai soba (small serving). The spicy Thai broth tasted amazing - it wasn't too spicy that it made my tongue burn but it wasn't too bland either. At first, I thought there definitely wasn't enough soba and I was kicking myself for ordering a small serving but the waitress told me that I could get a refill of the soba 2 more times after the initial. After the second time, I was definitely full. I also ordered green tea icecream because I was craving something sweet after the spiciness. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. This was the best soba I ever had and if I am in the area, I am definitely coming back! Highly highly recommend!",0
"Food: xiao long bao, and lunch specials (shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce and mixed vegetables). Everything was just ok. The dumplings are way too big. I was disappointed that the mixed vegetables were in a brown sauce because I prefer white. Price: Overpriced.",0
"This place is beautiful but the food is greasy and the waiters are water aggressive. One thing that is really offputting is the way the front door is handled. We were witness to alot of infighting between the hosts and another neighboring restaurant.  Also, the menu should come with photos if the waiters cannot explain the dishes being served. What I expressed interest in was not what I got.",0
"Was looking for some Cuban food and after studying the Yelp reviews the choice was Havana Central. Our server was informative and friendly. With  my son being a vegan there is a limited amount of food to order. But in that order, the Vegetable Paella was the choice. It came in a huge kettle with a load of zucchini, onions , peppers and peas. I had the Salmon which was accompanied with yellow rice and black beans, spinach, zucchini and red, green bell peppers. The rice and beans were a little bland but mixing in the  veggies helped.We order the Tostones and Maduros just in case we didn't have enough to eat. The Tostones  were very big but lacked flavor. They need salt.I ordered the Rose Sangria. Very fruity and tasty. It had pineapple , bits of apple and some grapes.Ordering the side dishes was over the top , so there were leftovers.In all a good Cuban experience. Would recommend to anyone staying in the Mid Manhattan area.",0
"This restaurant is amazing! The steak pho and spring rolls are my favorite dishes here. The spring rolls are so crispy and flavorful, and the pho is really good too. The staff is really friendly and the ambience is really casual. The only downside is that it's a little pricey, but overall I really enjoyed my meal here. I'll definitely be back!",1
"The Malt House is a great place to go for a casual night out with friends. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating, and the wings were delicious. The only downside was that the washroom was shared by both men and women, which made it a bit difficult to use. Overall, a great experience.",1
"This review is for 3.5 stars. Average Thai food and not worth the wait. No reservations and waitlist only from what I was told so I came and got a 30 minute timing to get seated for one on a Saturday night. This place to begin with is incredibly loud.  I couldn't hear my waiter and even just putting my name down there was back and forth unnecessarily due to noise. Food comes out slow and most dishes $15 average for small and in $25-35 range for bigs. Also have a tasting menu for $55 but it's not available for 1 peeps diners. I had the sisig and papaya salad and buns. Buns come in 4s and are grata for dipping. Though not sure what dish really works for this method of consuming other than curry. These are great for big tables though just to get meal starter early. Papaya salad was large and meaty and sharable but overall not spicy and pretty lackluster. Crunch worked but it wasn't mixed so each bite was different. Chicken good in the dish which is j owe addition but I'd rather find a spicy version than this. Sisig is a signature here and presentation makes the dish. Once you mix the egg and meat it's just fine. Extremely fatty and weird, unnecessary addition of peppercorn. Had an IPA in top for $11 but overall their cocktail and beer lists are quite tiny ; tasty lists but way below expected for this caliber. Pig and Khao is fine but not great Thai food by any standard in my mind. They have inconsistent spice levels and waitstaff doesn't accommodate aversion such as mine where I struggle with peppercorn and labor leaf, both of which he said weren't in any dish I ordered (wrongly told!). Probably wouldn't be back and would think to find another Thai spot near town for those cravings.",0
"The Tavern is a great restaurant for those who want to enjoy a casual meal. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The menu is extensive and includes everything from burgers and salads to entrées like grilled sea bass and apple crumble. The food was excellent, and though it got a bit mushed in transit, the crumble was still delicious. Overall, I had a great experience at The Tavern and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I visited Yoon Haeundae Galbi for the first time and I wasn't impressed. My favorite dish was the galbi, but it wasn't amazing. The meat was a bit burnt and the bitterness from the grilling was really noticeable. I also wasn't a fan of how the grill was left uncleaned while we were eating. I think this place would be better for business dinners or for people who are new to Korean food.",1
"Really solid Szechuan food here.  Came here on a reunion with friends I hadn't seen since before the pandemic.  Have to admit, I did not expect such good Szechuan food this far uptown.  Just a few things we tried: woodear mushrooms, spicy fish fillet, sauteed cauliflower, salted egg shrimp.Salted Egg Shrimp:PROS- wow. AMAZING flavor.- not overly oily, this is key being that it's batter-fried.- not overly SALTY (also key)CONS:- none.Woodear mushrooms:PROS:- well cooked, not super hard or crunchy near the stem- well seasonedCONS:- a bit small in quantity.Spicy fish filletPROS:- great quantity to share- nice chunks of fish, not too small.- not too spicy!! Just the right amount of heat.- really nice flavor and balance between heat and salt/seasoning.CONS:- noneCauliflowerPROS:- decent quantity.- not over cooked (cauliflower is hard to get right)CONS:- could be better flavored. It wasn't bad but with the other three, it just paled in comparison.I would definitely come back here to try a few more things on the menu!",0
"Little basil is so good if your in the Kips Bay neighborhood. I dined in, but I believe most of their business goes through takeout, so you'll always be able to get a table if you choose to go in. The dining room is quite cute, and we were the only ones there. It's also BYOB. You can bring in your own bottle of wine or a 6-pack. First one free, then they charge a $10 corking fee. Really loved the little basil fried rice, and you can choose you spice level according to your preference. Great service too. I will be back!",0
"I highly recommend Oceans New York for a delicious and affordable meal during Restaurant Week. The Salmon fillet was cooked to perfection and the side of Grilled Asparagus was delicious. The only downside was that I couldn't taste the Parsnip. Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience and would definitely return.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but the service was really poor. The waiters were not attentive and it took a long time to get our food. The atmosphere was really nice, but the quality of the food let it down. I would recommend this place to someone who is looking for a nice date night, but not for a quick meal.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience ordering food from here! The service was super quick, and the dishes I got were both very delicious. I especially loved the princess tofu dish - it was so flavourful and tender. The only downside was that the wrap boxes were a bit messy, as the sauce tended to leak out. But overall, I would definitely recommend trying this place out!",1
"I would rate this place 3.5 at most. Don't get me wrong the ambiance was amazing and so was the service. So this rating is strictly for the food. I read the previous reviews here so I had a pretty high expectation for this place. I came here with a party of 3. We ordered the bone marrow, beef tartar entree, monkfish and oxtail and the Brussel sprouts. the bone marrow was honestly so little, it was a crazy tease, it looked like two hefty bone marrow but it didn't have any of the goods inside like I could cleanly scrape everything off with one tiny spoon... i was pretty disappointed. Next the beef tar tar was decent, I only snuck a small bite of it because the portion was so small and I felt bad if I took more because it wouldn't have been filling for my friend. the monkfish was definitely over cooked and rubbery/tough. The clams that also accompanied the dish was small despite how big the shell itself was and the shrimp had a little bit of a plasticy taste to it... overall the monkfish was poorly seasoned, quite flavorless. The oxtail was a little too salty to my liking. but the flavors mixed well with mash potatoes that was accompanied by it. Also the brussel sprouts were super super sweet and charred and it still had a lot of the bitter taste to it, I think it was poorly executed. I heard the brunch here is amazing, so I might try that next time but def will pass on coming here for dinner sadly.",0
"I've been to this restaurant a few times and their soft serve machine has been unreliable. I've had to ask for a to-go order of ice cream each time and it's not always easy to get lids for the containers. It would be better if they had lids available. Otherwise, the way they're packing ice cream isn't the most effective, but it's not a big deal.",1
"I stopped by Piccola Cucina Estiatorio for dinner and I was really impressed. They make their own pasta here and it was really fresh and the texture was perfect. The octopus was a bit on the chewy side for my taste, but overall the food was delicious. The service was really fast and attentive, which was great. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good Italian meal.",1
"I made a reservation here a few weeks in advanced for 4 people at 7pm as last time I was visiting I was not able to go. We were seating in the outdoor area, but it felt more like a private room and was so nicely insulated with closing doors! It was so cute, SF could learn a few things from NY's outdoor dining. We ordered several things to share- Burrata ($19)- good size burrata and very delicious, but honestly the baked camembert was the star. Baked Camembert ($24)- this was so so good. I'm so glad we ended up getting it because while burrata is usually my go to, this was so decadent and creamy- one of my favorites of the night. Dozen oysters ($42)- I've recently got more into oysters, and I must say these ones were SO fresh. Big fan! Ratatouille ($26)- this was also delicious, but if I had gotten this as an entre for myself I think I would still be hungry. Fries ($12)- nicely crispy, no complaints on this one! Brussels Sprouts ($12)- another favorite, so crispy and so much flavor. Makes you forget you're eating a vegetable! Two of our friends got the The World is Yours drink ($20) and enjoyed it! They were very pretty.Overall, ambiance was really nice! Service was good, maybe a tad slow- sometimes I think it's easy to get forgotten when you're in the outdoor seating that's closed off from the rest of the restaurant. Would definitely come back when in NYC- also want to try the speakeasy next time.",0
"I visited this restaurant based on the good reviews and unfortunately, I was not impressed. The staff was nice and the service was good, but the food was bland and lacked salt and vinegar. The dumplings sauce was also flavorless, which made it not worth a second try for me. The rice roll was fine but again, flavorless except for the subtle taste of char. The mushroom sloppy had no flavor at all. I was really sad because I was so looking forward to our visit.",1
It was decent. The chicken sandwich was a tad small but it was fresh and fried and had pickles. I also got a side of roasted corn.  The bartender was warm and accommodating. I went for lunch by myself and veni vidi vici.,0
My boyfriend and I came here this weekend for a date night. We were seated upstairs which felt oddly corporate and clearly less decorated than the first floor. Unfortunately it took about 20 minutes for someone to come take our drink order which was not the best start to our evening. From then on our experience improved. The drinks were excellent and our entrees were delicious (we ordered the Baja tacos and enchiladas). I will say the guacamole is extremely average... especially for $15. This is a solid Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood but definitely not the best.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was prompt and the food was delicious. I especially loved the pork belly and kimchi fries. The only downside was that there were a lot of empty tables, so we had to go through the buzzer. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Talk about overpriced and not that good food. I came here for dinner(I know, what was I thinking) but the person I came with wanted to eat here. Had to wait about 20-30 mins for a table at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. The service here is good but everything is just ok. My friend got the Mac and cheese with bacon, and honestly it was nothing special but cost about $20. It comes with a marinara sauce that literally tastes like the lunchables pizza sauce. I had the BALT sandwich which is bacon, lettuce, avocado and lettuce sandwich. Barely any lettuce and bacon is hard and tasteless. The only highlight was the avocado. The waffle fries are good but nothing extraordinary. I didn't have an appetite for dessert but probably should've only come here to eat the chocolate fondue. I wouldn't come back here to eat food but maybe dessert. I don't know, probably not though.",0
I went to 2 Bros for the first time and I was not disappointed! The cheese slices are just $1 and they're big and hearty. The crust is really soft and the cheese and toppings are perfect. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good pizza deal.,1
"Planet Taco is a great place for tacos. The Japan Taco was good, the Cuba Taco was a nice surprise, and the Italy Taco was inconclusive. The only downside is that I didn't like the Local Tastes section, which has entries such as the Italian sausage-laden Staten Island and the Brooklyn, with corned beef.",1
"I just finished my pork katsu donburi. It was so good and nicely presented. I liked how they put 3 different sides. And the price was also affordable ($13.06) and I didn't need to wait too long to get the food. I had a bad experience once in here when I dined in before pandemic, but it seems like the service got nicer as well!",0
I recently tried the watermelon dole whip and it was awesome! It tasted like sour patch watermelon gummies. I didn't get poke on this trip but I'll definitely return for more soon!,1
"Came here to meet up with a group of friends. I personally only came for their happy hour specials and didn't really eat much. I still enjoyed my time here and did ended up ordering a snack later in the night.The beers are $6 during happy hour, which is a price you cannot beat. The draft selections for the happy hour is phenomenal as well: Sapporo Lager, Six Point Pilsner, and what I kept ordering, Ithaca Flower Power. Wells drinks are $10 during happy hour. There are three select cocktails they offer for happy hour: Beeline, Serrano Margarita, and Charlie Collins for $12.For my late night snack, I got the Truffle Fries. I've had these before at the Koreatown location, so I know they're good, especially the dipping sauces that comes with it. For $8, it was worth it and I pretty much ate the entire thing myself.Will be back again for their happy hour specials between 4pm-7pm. These deals are too good to pass up.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was amazing, and the service was great. I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"The Nowon burger is definitely worth trying, but the chopped cheese rice cakes are even better! The server was very accommodating and helped us pick the seat with the least amount of direct sunlight, even helping us switch tables after a better one opened up. The honey butter tater tots were also delicious and worth trying. It was homey and familiar like a cup of Kraft Mac & Cheese, but fused with New York City style and elevated.",1
"Had a lovely early Valentines Day dinner here. It's a small space but they've done a wonderful job with the decor that has a modern, minimalist night market vibe to it. We ordered several things off the menu including the army stew. First time I've had Spam and honestly I might be a fan now. The stew had a good assortment of ingredients including sausage, mini dumplings, and ramen that keeps you digging in for more. We also got the Korean fried chicken wings, a highlight of the meal and wonderful that they don't use milk in the batter for those of us that are lactose intolerant. The bibimbap with pork was also delicious and a very hefty serving so had to take some of it home. The seafood pancake, though beautiful in presentation, was a little lacking flavor wise, especially in comparison to all the other dishes. Would recommend coming here for a date or with a group of friends but do make sure to make a reservation as the space fills up fast.",0
"The Smith is a great place for brunch or lunch. The butternut squash tortolloni is definitely my favorite dish - it's delicious and creamy. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but overall I recommend this restaurant.",1
"I was really looking forward to dining at Kings Co Imperial, but I was sadly disappointed. The food was tame and unremarkable, and the cocktails were weak. The service was slow and unhelpful, and some of the dishes we ordered never arrived. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"I enjoy this place, went for a quick happy hour and the bartending staff is out of this world. Very kind, respectful and sparked great conversation. One recommended me to come for brunch. She rocked.Here's where they lost me. They added  gratuity. What is the reason behind that? The bartenders are doing an exceptional job and they should be rewarded why put a pebble in my boot by adding a mandatory tip. Nonetheless I am consumed by the hype and will come back.",0
"Made a reservation here for a Saturday brunch. Loved the ambience and decoration of the indoors. I ordered the Pao de Queijo as part of the Yelp special. They were cheesy puff balls, nice crisp on the outside, with melted cheese on the inside. For my main, I ordered the mussels which was also good. I loved the sauce and the side of bread it came with. The service was attentive and I enjoyed my meal here.",0
"We went in for a really late lunch, around 2pm and it was CROWDED. There were only 3 of us and we were luckily able to get a table really quick. If you have a party of 3 and under, you will share the table with another party. They try to fill every chair. The food was mediocre, my siblings and I weren't really satisfied with it, but it filled our stomachs! It was hard getting employees to come by if you didn't speak chinese. DISCLAIMER: If you don't like tea, tell them!! You get charged for tea. I drink tea, so luckily we actually paid for something we'll actually drink. I ordered desserts and the jelly rabbits were so cute! I'm the only one in my family who loves durian, so I also ordered the durian pastry. They didn't have any at the time I ordered, so we waited quite a bit for it. The waiters (non-cart) people were constantly running around and were extremely busy. It's normal to wave like a psycho to get the cart and totally ok to walk up to the cart and check what's in there. I'd go earlier if you want a lot of food, there wasn't much left by the time we got there... that was our bad though. Happy dim summing!",0
"3 Times is a great restaurant for casual Chinese food. The pan seared egg and chive buns were my favorite dish - the egg was cooked perfectly and the bun was fluffy and delicious. The pan fried vegetable dumplings were also great - they were crispy and had a good flavor. The shredded pork noodles were also very good - the noodles were cooked perfectly and the pork was tender. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite empty when I visited, so service was a bit slow. Overall, I would definitely recommend 3 Times to anyone looking for a good Chinese meal.",1
"We were the only ones there at noon on a Sunday. We got the outdoor patio. With lots of kids, it was perfect. Including the weather for outdoor seating. Wood fired pizzas taste yummier than the others. The ones here did too. I especially liked the onions and mushrooms one, though the onions could've been caramelized a bit more. The fries were very good, thin and crispy. The beverage menu is basic, but a good place overall.",0
Solid option for lunch in NYC. My NYC office is right across the street and we came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. Nice lunch menu with about 10 choices for $10 which is a good deal for the city. I got the cheeseburger which came with fries. Tasty burger and decent fries. My co-worker got the Coffee Rub Burger which he said was okay. Service downstairs around bar was... average at best. The server legit walked away from table as my friend was finishing his order. She acted like she couldn't be bothered. Hence the reason for 3 stars.,0
Bao by Kaya is a temporary restaurant located in Bryant Park during the winter shops. I wanted to try the duck bao but the pork bao did the trick before I gave up after the Chinese Lunar New Year. The steamed bao bun was excellent and earned this 4 star rating along with the properly cooked meat and condiments.,1
"Got the grandma's favorite from this spot. Good fast casual Chinese food.The pairing for the Grandma's bowl is pretty good, bok choy, tomatoes with egg, meatballs served with forbidden rice. I love purple rice, it's so much more flavorful so I was very happy to be able to get purple rice.The ingredients were pretty fresh. I think the flavors for me though, were a bit light and I wished the flavors were more distinct. Usually, the tomatoes and egg is more tangy while the meatballs I wish had a sauce to spice up the food even more.I think this is a healthier take on Chinese food / fast casual Chinese food. Good spot for when you want Chinese food that's quick and you don't want to feel so guilty eating!",0
"I ordered from this restaurant for delivery, and I wasn't expecting them to mess up my order. How could they mix up crawfish and jumbo shrimp? Jumbo shrimp is much bigger than crawfish, and I find crawfish to be gross. I'm actually quite disappointed with the food, as it tastes good but is very expensive for the quantity you get. It would be better to eat this at the restaurant itself. All things considered, the food is good, but it's pricier than other places I've tried. I would recommend ordering from here if you're in the area, but make sure to double check your order before you get it!",1
"We had wanted to go to Sugarfish next door, but was pressed for time with the wait there. So we chose to have lunch here. We are Malaysian, so that was up our alley. They had lunch specials which was great. It actually was a really great deal. Soup, salad, spring rolls, and entree for $15! The soup was surprisingly good. It was homemade chicken broth. Really appreciated that it wasn't some artificial MSG soup. It was the best thing amongst the three apps. I ordered the Indonesian fried noodles for my entree. It was just OK for me. Kinda lacked flavor. My cousin had the Kuew Teoh which was more flavorful. I think all in all a great lunch deal and decent food for the area. Maybe 3.5 stars is more accurate.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The location is really cute and the staff was super nice. The pizza was a little lackluster, but it was still pretty good. I haven't tried any of the other food yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to it! The servers were all very accommodating and we were able to walk in even though it was busy. Overall, a great experience!",1
The maitre d was not my favorite. Ambiance and food were worth the 5 stars. Our servers were lovelyThe toro tartare was delicious. The saltiness of the caviar with the freshness of the toro really has a balanced flavor. The tomahawk was ordered medium but seemed a bit more charred and cooked through. Still tasty with very good flavor. Had a sauce on top that I enjoyed. The Wok fried snapper had a good flavor. The sauce on it was very delicious. The fish seemed to be cubed and fried making it easier to eat,0
"A bit pricey but overall a really good restaurant!!! I was surprised to walk In and be able to be seated with a party of 4 on a Friday night in Times Square but they accommodated my family well tried the lobster roll, it was really good ordered some extra sauce didn't really care for but the sandwich was great I will definitely come back here again!!! Drinks were by far the best Ive had in NYC service was awesome as well to bad I forgot his name",0
"This is a unique little gem on the boarder of LES and East Village. I had it saved on my bookmark list for quite some time and was excited when I finally went for brunch. Interior: I love the style of this place. It's nothing over the top, but is cute enough for Instagram. (Gotta relate to my audience, haha. ) I ordered the Monte Cristo- it was delicious and bursting with flavor. The service was good. I will add that I sat at the bar, and caught an interesting conversation happening with who I assumed to have been the owner and a guest that was dining. She seems sassy, which for me personally, made me like this place even more. It's spunky. There isn't a ton of seating (but really, where is there a ton of seating in this area?!), so you may want to get here on the early side and don't try to come with a large party. I look forward to coming back another time to try some more items for another brunch and dinner. 4/5",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for dinner last night and it was PACKED! I was seated quickly and from the moment we walked in, every employee we encountered was so pleasant. It seemed like the wait staff all acted like a team and on multiple occasions people who were not our waitress asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. The service alone is why I am giving 5 stars. Unfortunately, our meal didn't go perfectly. We never got our app and my dinner came out incorrectly. But that still didn't ruin our experience purely because of how wonderful everyone was to us - they were apologetic, offered to rectify it and were just a pleasure to deal with. The food we did eat was excellent. I would definitely revisit and I applaud how lovely everyone was in such a high paced extremely busy atmosphere.",1
"Hmmm...It was ok, REALLY wanted to like it more.  There aren'y many of this kind of ""old school"" diner type places left in the city.  This one has a particular claim to fame as it is the exterior used as the ""diner"" in Seinfeld.  Unfortunately, I think that alone is the fuel this place continues to run on.  They don't appear to have put a whole lot of intention into sprucing up the inside space, re-thinking their menu/price point, or even turning out a better quality of product from the kitchen.Overpriced for super mediocre food.",0
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The interior is incredibly inviting and I felt like I was sitting in the parlor of some sort of Malaysian royalty. The food was amazing, reminding me of some of the best restaurants in New York City. My drink of choice was the Lasso the Moon, Bubble Trouble, and Api-Api. All of them were really different, colorful, and flavorful. My appetizers were the Larb Fries and the Cantonese salt & pepper calamari. Both were really delicious, and the Larb fries reminded me of crispy French fries but the calamari blew me away. It was cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy at all. The pieces were big and the dipping sauce elevated it so much. Definitely a must order. For my entrees, I got the soy sauce braised pork belly, the laksa noodles, fried rice, and pad see ew. All of them were fantastic, and my dining partner commented on this Pad See Ew being the best she's ever had. The laksa noodles were amazing, with the entire bowl being eaten. The broth was perfect and everything complimented the flavors. The rice was impressive, and the pork was tender and juicy. The sauce",1
"Chicken pad Thai delicious! Wow the noodles are cooked so well and so many flavors. Crispy pork basil was so good! Even after getting it delivered, it was still crispy! I would order this again Tom yum was mehBasil fried rice very good",0
"The sushi here is definitely a bit on the pricey side, but the quality of the sushi is definitely worth it! I tried the toro scallion, scallop, spicy tuna, poke tuna, yellowtail scallion and salmon cucumber. All of them were delicious, but my favorites were the toro and spicy tuna. One thing to note is that the hand rolls come with removable plastic, but they're not very effective when removing them, so be careful not to spill the sushi inside. The flavors were great and the amount of wasabi they put into the rolls was perfect. Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch at this restaurant and would definitely come back!",1
"This is a takeout order via Caviar, so this review is not representative of a supposedly better dine-in experience, but there is no excuse for sub-standard food if the restaurant decided to offer take out.Got a 3-piece omakase and a salted uni and salmon roe bowl. The sushis do not taste fresh and are fairly thinly sliced. Don't enjoy the choice of fish as well and the 3 pieces tasted very flat altogether. The salted uni and salmon roe bowl looks outright depressing - by ""uni"" it is literally just uni sauce splat on a bed of rice, with too much scallions spilled on top of it that kill the flavours. Salmon roe is okay but still below average. I think at this point I may be biased but even the rice feel too sticky and not rightly flavoured to be eaten in this chirashi style bowl.At $40 plus all the fees and delivery tips this is nowhere close to be worth it. Again if you actually eat there it could be entirely different - but I'm not interested in giving that a try after this.",0
I'm so glad I finally had the chance to try this restaurant! I've been hearing so much about it and I'm so glad I finally got to experience it myself. The noodles were really good and they were really chewy which I loved. The meat was also really tender and I really enjoyed the flavors. The wait was definitely worth it and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.,1
"I had a marvelous time at this restaurant! The waiters were very attentive and made sure our glasses were full throughout the meal. The mezze dips were especially delicious, with a freshly baked pita bread as a delightful appetizer. For the main course, I tried the moroccan fish (branzino), the lamb kebab halabi, and the chicken musakhan. The lamb kebab halabi was absolutely amazing!! The presentation was great - served in a fresh baked taboon bread with the lamb sausages kept warm inside. The meat was super flavorful and juicy. They also had a few tasty desserts as well for a sweet finish. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is amazing and the service is great. I usually get the Spicy Cumin Lamb stir fry with ribbon noodles and it's the best I've ever had. The texture of the Ribbon Noodles is amazing and the size is perfect. The cumin lamb is very flavorful and not too spicy. I also love the Cumin Lamb Soup and the cumin beef soup. Besides noodles, this place makes some really good dumplings. Be sure to try the Pork and Chive Dumplings. They're my favorite. This restaurant is small so I usually get my food to go, but I've been able to sit in and eat here once or twice. I think the prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food for your money. They also accept online orders and they're on Ubereats. I absolutely love this restaurant and I would highly recommend it to anyone!",1
"I ordered food from this restaurant and got food poisoning the same night. The char shiu tasted bland, the clam and ground meat is only spicy without much other flavor. I felt I can't digest the food well after eating it. The longer after I had the food, the worse I felt. Eventually at night I puked them all out. I don't recommend this place at all.",1
I've been going to Thai Son for decades and they never disappoint. They have nice outdoor seating and service is quick and efficient as always. The pho is super flavorful and the summer rolls are always refreshing. Please continue to support this restaurant!,1
"Well, they're authentic French with the St. Tropez vibe -- right down to the unfriendly service, high prices, and pretty narrow menu.  To be fair we just had a drink here.  For a French place, it was way too hard to get a glass of champagne poured by the glass.  (I'm anti-splits and that's all they had.)  Eventually, after saying no to real champagne by the glass (prosecco may have been available), the woman cracked a bottle of Veuve Clicquot, which was nice, and poured us two glasses.   The setting is pretty and the interior well done, if a bit crowded.  Covid-wise it's well ventilated with fully opening front windows, a patio outdoors and an indoor-outdoor vibe indoors.We were thinking of having lunch here on a subsequent day during our trip, but the menu is really more of a dinner-only menu in my opinion than a lunch and dinner menu.  (Who wants Daube Provencale or Jarret d'Angeau for lunch?)  So we opted out.",0
"I recently visited this pizza place in downtown Tampa and I have to say it was great! The service was good, not great, but definitely good. The place was packed and we got a table right away. The salad was fresh, simple and delicious. We opted for the funghi pizza. The cremini mushrooms quartered was interesting - you usually see them sliced or chopped but this ensured mushroom flavor in every bite. When done right, you cannot go wrong with Neapolitan style pizza - and they do it right here. I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely come back here for the pizza. If they get stable folks on the service end, this place can get continued high marks.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and was not impressed. Their dumpling was so thick greasy and doughy. The soup also tasted sour and didn't have much flavor. The place needs a lot of renovation, it felt really old and dirty. However, the prices are really affordable. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. The Chelsea burger was delicious, and the fries were very similar to McDonald's. My friends enjoyed their fried chicken tacos, and the 3 slider appetizer was also similar in size and quality to an In and out / Mcdonald's burger. However, the service was not great. The hostess was very rude when I called and asked if the Semifinals football game would be playing, and she eventually kicked us out of the restaurant at 8 even though our reservation was until 8:30. Additionally, she included the tip in the total bill rather than bringing me back a printed receipt, which made a 10$ difference. I don't know if I'll return to this restaurant, but it's a good option for better/a bit more upscale food and cozier seating for a sports oriented bar.",1
"I was sad that one of my favorite Pho places in the city, An Choi, closed due to COVID. In order to satisfy my pho cravings, we decided to try Hanoi House and I'm glad we did. It was just as delicious if not better. The broth was flavorful and deep. You could choose two or three types of meet, highly recommend rare filet mignon and oxtail. We had two young children and the staff was beyond accommodating - not only they reserved the booster chairs for us, they even divided up the pho into two small bowls for my girls. In terms of COVID safety, all staff wore masks and gloves. You check menu with QR code. Felt really safe.",0
"I had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. The first impression was that the restaurant was very disorganized. I went for the lunch special and when the food runner dropped off the salad, soup, and spring roll, I asked if there was meat in anything...he said no. Then my food arrived 1 minute later and I asked again if there was meat in the soup, then he said yes, it's chicken soup. Then I told him I don't eat meat and he took it back in a hurry... even though I didn't finish telling him that the spring roll inside was RAW. He looked as if I was inconveniencing him for me dining there. As I was explaining to him that the spring roll was raw... he cut me off and said no meat. RAW spring roll... MEAT in the soup for a VEGETARIAN...this experience was so bad that I could not even stay to dine more. NEW RESTAURANT WITH A untrained staff leading to bad service. there is not training on food allergies leading them to not take food allergies seriously. Never again will I return and I hope that no vegetarian accidentally eats meat here.",1
I love places where vegans and plant based eaters can go with friends and no one has to compromise. Zazzy's offers a pretty good selection of vegan options. I ordered a slice and the mozzarella sticks which thankfully were delicious  because they were quite pricey. Another wonderful thing about this place is that it's near so many other vegan spots too and it is conveniently located near many transit lines as well.,0
My first hand roll experience! So glad I checked this place out since it's amazing. It's not cheap but not super pricey given tip is included in the menu prices. $33 for 5-6 handrolls. I really loved the lobster and crab handrolls! The food tasted so fresh and the ambiance is great. Highly recommend if you love sushi!,1
"TongKatsu is great at TongKatsu!I sampled a bit of everything on the menu including the Chicken Karage, Chicken Breast Katsu, and Pork Tenderloin Katsu.  Each entree came with rice, slaw, TongKatsu sauce and Japanese pickles on the side.   I also got the French Fries with the curry sauce on the side.  Each menu entree item was drained properly out of the fryer prior to plating.  The pickles and slaw sides on each plate served a nice counter balance to the excess fried items on each plate.  There wasn't many other options other than the fried items on the menu but that was kind of known going in.  All three fried mains were great but I liked the meatier dark meat Chicken Karage the best.  The fries were initially missing the curry sauce but remedied nicely with a big cup of curry sauce on the side after making it known to the host.  TongKatsu is a really tight restaurant and a small operation so plan accordingly in the event seating onsite is not available.  There may be 10 seats max in the entire restaurant.  The host was really great and I wouldn't hesitate to revisit when I have an hankering for TongKatsu in the future.",0
"Printers Alley is a great sports bar with a great atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the drinks are well stocked. The only downside is that they don't have any TVs in the bar, so if you're looking for something to watch you'll have to head to another spot.",1
Excellent Dumpling House is a great restaurant for those looking for a quick and convenient meal. I've had the xiao long bao here and they are always delicious. The kung pao chicken is also very good and the fried dumplings are my favorite item on the menu. The lo mein is also very tasty and has a great smoky wok flavor. My bf is a very picky eater and he has never had a bad experience at Excellent Dumpling House. He even says he would take a pill to avoid eating food if it meant he had this great restaurant all to himself!,1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The soup base is really good and there are lots of options for noodles. I also loved the appetizer - it was really good. They're open 24 hours, so it's great for late night snacks.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by this ramen joint! The ton ton pork is amazing and the egg is perfect, giving the ramen a bit of additional richness. The ramen is not too oily, and the small location is a plus. Overall, a great experience.",1
"I stopped by Ramen Yokocho for a quick bowl of tonkotsu ramen and wasn't disappointed. The broth was still satisfying and enjoyable, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The only downside was the wait, which was about 30 minutes even for solo dining. The noodles were okay though, and the toppings could have been a bit more flavorful. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely come back.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The chicken was really good, and the portion size was really generous. They also have a lot of different sauce options, which made the chicken even better. The fries were also delicious, and I really enjoyed the variety of them. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and delicious meal.",1
"I finally got to check out mermaid inn on a Tuesday evening after walking past this place many times in the past and seeing that it was always lively. I made a reservation which was a good decision, because at 6:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, the place was already buzzing with activity. After checking in with the host and showing my proof of vaccination, I was seated inside next to another party. There was probably about 6 in of space between our tables. The happy hour menu was short, but it was still big enough to have a selection of items to choose from. I got the pink flamingo cocktail, which was pleasant and reminded me of warmer days. I started off my meal with some oysters and clams, which were very fresh, but some of the clams and oysters were definitely bigger than others. The fried calamari came in a basket, and was fried to perfection. The interior itself wasn't too chewy, and had just enough softness to it. I also got the spinach artichoke dip, nothing too out of the ordinary here, however I did wish that there were more crackers provided than the four crackers that came with the dish. The mini fish tacos were also pretty flavorful, and the fish meat itself was perfectly flaky, not too dry, and was seasoned well. No fishy taste at all! The salmon tartar was served in some sort of soy sauce-like brine, personally it was a little too salty for me, but the fish was fresh. Overall I had a pretty good experience, and even just ordering off of the happy hour menu itself, I had a great time.",0
"Red Rooster Harlem is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The food is delicious and hearty, and the live band is a nice touch. My favorite dish was the Mac and Greens, which was a perfect combination of cheese and greens with a dash of green to minimize the guilt. The Impossible Chicken Nuggets were also a hit, tasting like the real thing. The salmon over bulgar was also delicious, with a tangy and spicy flavor. The corn bread was also heavenly, buttery and soft. I would definitely recommend Red Rooster Harlem to anyone looking for a fun and delicious night out!",1
"Don't bother coming here. 

We made a reservation for August for our date night. He got a confirmation but tried to call to check and no one picked up. He had the confirmation so we decided to give it a go since there were a few good reviews and nothing to indicate otherwise. Just a small number of reviews but we wanted to give them a chance. 

Showed up to a completely blacked out restaurant. It would have been great for people to have notified. The restaurant is irresponsible and needs to be held accountable. I see now that others have run into the same issue so posting here to help others avoid this situation. Go elsewhere. I do not recommend because you'll end up wasting time that you won't get back and NYC is still a place that you typically need to plan ahead with reservations.

Don't let this place throw a wrench into your plans.",1
"I had a good time at Yee Li's, despite the poor service. The food was good, and the servings were huge. The prices were also reasonable.

However, the service was really poor. The waiters avoided eye contact, and it was often difficult to get them to do anything. It was also difficult to get them to bring anything you asked for, or to clear your plates. And when they did, it was often with very little explanation or apology.

Overall, I had a good time, but I'm not sure I'll be returning anytime soon.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was really fun. It was packed, but that didn't stop me from getting a great meal. Parking was a bit of a pain, but I was able to find a spot on the street. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Overall, I thought the food at Som Bo was decent. The farro bowl was my favorite, but the tofu was flavorless. I would come back for lunch if I'm in the area.",1
"I visited Hulouim Cheese this past weekend and was impressed with the food choices and the patio. The quinoa salad was a great starter, and the cheese was delicious. The yogurt and granola bowl were also very good. The only downside was that the service was a bit slow, but overall I had a great experience.",1
"Came here a couple weeks ago for lunch. Overall the food was ok with a good selection. I had the buttermilk chicken sando. My friend had some fresh veggies with a sandwich. The outdoor seating is nice and spacious.Service wasn't great though, that's my chief complaint. If you check out my reviews, I'm very pro-business, especially during covid-19. But there's no excuse for very poor service. So if I say the service is bad, imagine how it is during pre-covid. Our waitress was super curt. She seemed pretty impatient and annoyed the entire time. She would come to our table every 3 minutes asking if we're ready. The place wasn't busy at all, there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables being served at the time. It did get busy after we got our food, but she would still come and ask us if we need anything else and how everything was.I ordered a mocha coffee, but she assumed I wanted it cold, but that was incorrect since she already brought it and I didn't want to bother her. The entire time I felt like I was being rushed and my conversation with my friend kept getting interrupted. This might be a one-off experience, but it definitely left a bad impression on me.",0
"Came here around 11pm on a Friday night with a large group of humans. Somehow, they were able to accommodate all of us. The service was fantastic despite having such a large group. To drink, I had a vodka based coconut mint drink (the name I have no idea) which was pretty tasty. Not my fave but it was still good. To eat, I had the mussels. It took me a while to realize that all the mussels had fallen into the soup and the shells were just sitting on top. The bread was very dry and tasted a bit burnt, but dipped/soaked into the sauce, it was delicious. I had asked for more bread to dip in my sauce and had walked away for a second. When I returned, the sauce was gone and no bread. I was so sad. I could have used more of that sauce in my belly. I tasted the fried rice and that was hands down the BEST fried rice I have ever tasted. I would break glass for that rice for sure! I tried the eggplant side dish, that was pretty tasty. I didn't try the lobster noodles but they looked fantastic. Next time I would most definitely have that! The music was so fun. Different music upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs was more dance floor type vide, much different clientele too. It was both fun.I will definitely come back! Unfortunately, couldn't take pictures. My useless phone died even before I got to the restaurant",0
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with Kings' Carriage House. The surroundings are cute, but the experience was generally unremarkable. The sandwiches were good, but the scones were doughy and the other sweets were forgettable. The tea selection was nothing to get excited about. Overall, it was a pretty unremarkable afternoon tea experience.",1
"I had a great time at the Yard House tonight. The wait was only 20 minutes, and the hostess was super friendly. However, after 5 minutes we find 2 seats at the bar, so we cancel our table reservation. At the bar Jasmine was so friendly with a great smile. We ordered drinks and two appetizers: the Fire Cracker Shrimp & Buffalo Tenders. The Fire Cracker shrimps were very tasty and came with what I would call hash browns on the bottom of the shrimp. The Buffalo Tenders were just too hot for me but made with good chicken. I also ordered a Grilled Chicken Creaser Salad which was delicious. Overall, great service... good food, I'd come back.",1
"A whole brand new outdoor dining section with not a single wheelchair accessible table, as if the ADA never existed. Beyond disrespectful.",0
"The outdoor dining experience at this restaurant was really nice. The menus are accessible via QR code, and the ceviches were excellent. We tried the mixto (mixed seafood with a kick- a little spice) and the yellowfin tuna ceviches. For appetizers, the octopus sashimi was nice with a touch of potatoes and avocado. The rock shrimp tempura and maitake mushroom dishes were hot dishes and tasty- the most favored starter dishes. The crab cake was not but did seem standard compared to the other dishes.

For entrees, the seafood paella and slow braised short ribs won our hearts. So tasty and satisfying. We also tried the lomo saltado, the duck, and the salmon dishes. The menu has a diverse selection of different proteins (except no vegetarian entrees). The sides consisted of vegetable dishes and we got the yuca fries and brussel sprouts, the latter being the favorite. For desserts, we tried the guava cheesecake, which was delicious, and the tres leches, which was amazing- one of the best tres leches I've ever had.

The service was friendly and attentive. Despite the occasional traffic noise and sirens",1
"Came here with my boyfriend one night for outdoor dining. The setup was decent but still a little bit chilly. The staff were very nice but our food did come out at different times and my boyfriend was left waiting for his dish while I ate because my food started getting cold. Maybe it was an off day for the kitchen because we could tell the staff were flustered by it. We got the uzbek plov, stew damlama (the dish that took awhile), and samsa puffs. I really liked the pastry puffs, they're flakey and crispy on the outside with a meaty and savory core. The rice pilaf was also very delicious, full of flavor and a textured crunch which I love. Overall good food but probably won't return until there's indoor dining available.",0
"Pasta was overcooked. Meat dishes were meh including the chicken parm. The decor is much better than the food. Not many good restaurants left in Little Italy. Thankfully, the pastry shops are still pretty decent.",0
"So far I've been to barn joo three times. The first time 3/4 dishes were GREAT (tofu, mushroom bibimbap, and fries - japchae was eh). Attempt number two was less of a success. BUT they redeemed themselves on trip number three. Some positives:  -vegan and non-vegan options-yelp wait list (so I've never waited long)-incredible mushroom bibimbap: great flavors and super crispy riceThe time that was not so great:-They put an egg in my bibimbap after I requested it be vegan. They then brought out free fries, but they were kind of burnt and very oily (the first time I got them they were good thkugh). When they finally brought out the bibimbap again, the rice wasn't crispy at all -_- I think because they rushed. Half of the reason I love that dish is because of the crispy rice, so this was greatly disappointing.-I always order this raw  veggie bowl (with lettuce and peppers and etc.) And they have a pepper in there that is hot as f*ck, but it just looks like one of those non-spicy korean peppers, so you bite into it and it really messes you up. It's bad. I really think they should warn you when they bring it, but they never do. It's 'mouth burning I need milk' hot, so not cool in my opinion. Anyway other than the above, I like this place and will keep coming back.",0
"Always reliable fun spot for great unique Japanese food at a reasonable cost. I've taken my mom, friends, big groups, and small groups here. Good music, seasonal menu items and tasty drinks. I'd recommend making a reservation so that you secure a spot with a group. Busy almost every night!",0
"Had an altogether great ramen experience here! My friend and I came in for dinner and got the tsukemen, the veggie ramen, and the karaage. I was pretty disappointed in the karaage, which I thought was bland, under-fried, and kind of soggy. Neither of us finished it. The veggie ramen was okay, it wasn't super exciting (but it was veg ramen so I'm not sure what we expected). I know this doesn't sound like a 4-star review thus far, but the tsukemen...oh my god. I think this was the greatest ramen I have tried in my entire life. It was so garlicky and flavorful, without being too fatty or salty. I'm not usually a huge fan of tonkatsu ramen because I always find it overwhelmingly fatty. This managed to be incredibly flavorful without being too rich. The garlic was phenomenal. And, the noodles were ideal consistency. This was a flawless ramen dish (the veg ramen was a nice palette cleanser between bites of the pork, too).Also, the service was great. Our waitress was very present and friendly! The atmosphere of the restaurant was cute. Next time I'll probably skip the karaage and go straight for the tsukemen, which they have clearly perfected.",0
"Ise Restaurant is a great place to go for a quick and affordable meal. The appetizers are especially good, and the soba noodles are especially flavorful. The only downside is that the portions are a bit small, so you might want to order a few dishes to share. The wait for a table can be a bit long, but the staff is generally friendly and accommodating.",1
"I had a great experience at BareBurger! Delaney was awesome and so helpful - she made sure that my order was perfect. The mushroom burger was delicious - tons of sweet potato fries in the order, and plenty to share with three people. The lemonade and whiskey were my favorite drinks this Summer, and they both tasted great here. Overall, an excellent experience - I'll definitely be back!",1
"The food at this restaurant was good, but it was a little pricey. The Fried Wontons were pretty crispy but nothing special, the Marinated Jellyfish was weird, and the Traditional Shanghai Pan Fried Soup Dumplings were my favorite. The Crab Roe Soup Dumplings were also good, but the duck was way too salty. Overall, the food was nicely presented, but I would recommend sticking to the dan dan noodles and the soup dumplings if you're looking for something more substantial. The price was around $25 per person, with tax and tip.",1
"I had an issue with AquaMarina once, as the person on the phone was making up his own prices and trying to charge me an arm an a leg for everything I was ordering... when I was looking at the prices online.However, I have ordered food from here several times after this, and it has been nothing less than amazing!!!",0
"I really enjoy eating at this restaurant in the summertime. The atmosphere is pretty standard, but the food is really good. I especially love their scrambled eggs with mushrooms. The toast is also really good, and the salad is very refreshing.",1
"Eh, it was alright. I got the fresh mozz pizza. The pros are there is plenty of indoor/outdoor seating. I'd rather go to Joe's down the street next time.",1
"Wow Rubirosa is so worth the hype! I've heard such good things about this place for a while, but it's always been fully booked that I've never been able to try. We finally got a chance to try on a weeknight and I'm so glad we did! We got the Tie-Dye and Rubirosa Supreme. I definitely liked Tie-Dye more, as the flavors complemented each other well. Supreme was more basic but was definitely more filling with the meat and veggie toppings. The crust was super thin, which I prefer. They were super busy so service was a bit slow, but all was forgiven as soon as we had our first bite of the pizza. Can't wait to come back!",0
"Vanessa's Dumpling House is an amazing restaurant! We tried some of the most popular items on the menu based off of several hundred of reviews and we were not disappointed. The dumplings seem to all be amazing but the pork and chives was by far the best!! Excellent flavor combination. The duck pancake was also delicious and very light! The boiled wontons in the spicy sauce was my wife's favorite, as it had a nice kick to it. They have a lot of options on the menu but definitely go for the dumplings!",1
"Overall, the food was good and the price is unbeatable. However, the customer service was slow and the fact that the place is cash only isn't ideal.",1
"The wait on a Monday night was about 30 minutes but once inside, it was worth waiting for.  I tried the medium spicy mandoo soondubu to mix it up and it was good although my favorite is still the mixed soondubu with seafood and beef.  The seafood pancake was also really good and the banchan which included the fried croaker was good.",0
"I ordered the 1. Classic sandwich (Sticky's sauce, purple slaw & pickle. The sandwich was very basic. I probably should have ordered more chicken fingers over sandwich. The sandwich was very basic, it only included two chicken fingers and cost $8.2. 5 fingers with included 3 sauces with fries. I chose Sticky's sauce, Mac Sauce and the Sassy Bbq. The fingers were fresh and delicious. I enjoyed it.I definitely enjoyed the food. Hopefully in the future, they would hire an extra worker. There was only one worker making the food and handling the order during lunch on Sunday. Shortly after I ordered, a lot more people came and some people left because the line to order was too long.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant again - the food was as delicious as ever. The only downside was that the table we were seated at on a Saturday night was quite cramped, and it was hard to move around. Our friends who made the reservation were regulars, so it was a bit of a surprise that we didn't get the table they were seated at. But overall, the experience was great. Our waiter was really nice, and the grilled bread was delicious. We were really happy to find that there was no corkage fee the night we went, so we were able to bring our own wine. We had a great time chatting with our waiter and the solo diner at the next table. The food was up to the very good to excellent standard that we've come to expect at this restaurant. We can't wait to come back!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for some quick eats and surprisingly, the food was pretty good. I ordered an arepa and it was nicely fried and tasty. The juice was also really good, I definitely enjoyed it. The restaurant is really small, so it's not the best place to visit if you're looking for a flashy atmosphere, but the food more than makes up for it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area.",1
"Would be a decent place for a drink if they sorted out their cooling situation. After work drinks with colleagues. Good selection of beer and bar bites.  Love the giants benches and tables, as I hate standing around in bars.  Unfortunately, they either don't have or choose not to use air conditioning indoors.  Sure, it wasn't too hot but this is a silly thing to have to deal with.  The indoor space was pretty empty, so it's likely that other people felt the same way. Otherwise, the place is fine.  The staff costumes are a little cheesy but it's just silly fun that helps it stand out a little bit more.",0
"This is a great place for an upscale Asian fusion dinner. The service and atmosphere were excellent, and the food was all very good. I got the lobster with ginger and scallion, pork wonton soup, soup dumplings, and spring rolls. They were all very good, but the shrimp spring rolls were my favorite. The prices are a bit more inflated then you'd expect, but it's definitely worth it for the quality of the food. I would definitely return for a special occasion.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The crispy roast pork was delicious, lean with the skin still crispy, just as I like it. The duck was also very good and not as oily as the ones from other places. They also sell whole roast pigs which are around 33lbs. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"I had brunch at Nice Matin recently and it was pretty good but nothing special. The prices were steep, but that is common on the UWS. They have a decent amount of outdoor seating and gives the impression of a french cafe. The service was pretty slow though they didn't seem that busy. I had the Benedict with lox which was good but not great. Overall an overage brunch place.",0
Came here wanting some standard bar food and was pretty disappointed. Our waitress was great and the ambience of the place is very fun and divey. I got the chicken sandwich which had good reviews but mine was just super dry and half of it was just fried batter. This is definitely more of a club dinner vibe so if you are looking for just true bar food go elsewhere. The drinks however are fun and I'm sure for a different sort of activity this spot is great (like brunch or just group drinks and apps) but again my experience with a FOOD was just blah. Also be aware that if you show up before 830 for dinner the spot is going to be completely empty!,0
Came here with some friends after happy hour on a Wednesday. We just happen to pop in after reading the menu outside. The decor and staff were both very pleasant. Our server was nice and professional and everything that we ordered was really good. We all had ramen bowls.,0
"I went to this restaurant with my colleagues last night and we were all pretty disappointed. The atmosphere is weird - stuffy and quiet but they have the patio which is very fratty. The waiters were very off putting as well; it felt as if they were trying to fight over our table and get our tips but when we put in our order we were asked to put down a card and open a tab? We ordered drinks at a seated booth so maybe it was because we were just drinking but I got the impression that they were not too keen on four 20-something year olds ordering fancy wine without some insurance. When we were ordering drinks, they did not give us a beer menu and when asked what beer my colleague wanted to order the waitress said ""sorry we don't have that"" and then didn't tell him which beers they did have? Very unprofessional for an upscale location like this.

The happy hour is decent - $5 beer $7 well and some wine. We got 2 glasses of $15 wine and four beers and the total came out to $60 which is not bad. I will say, however, that my $15 glass of wine came in a DIRTY WINE GLASS and I had to request a clean",1
"Not returning.I had lunch but accidentally passed by it. When I saw the two ladies making dumplings in the window, I walked in. It reminds me of the Dumpling House at 328 Spadina Ave,  in Toronto - a must for me whenever I visited there. The decor is simple and neat. I ordered small portion of chive pork dumpling (App Mewl Mandoo). Thick skin and the filling is too solid (packed, feeling dead), totally subpar.My adventure for a good dumpling place in New York, Continues.",0
"Finally was able to come here and try their sit-down food which I have been looking forward to. We arrived and the host was no where to be seen for at least 5 minutes until the bartender finally asked if we had been helped and retrieved the hostess. Even though we had a reservation we still had to wait about 20 minutes until we were seated. Once seated, we waited awhile for our waiter to come (my boyfriend went and got us water and silverware himself). Finally ordered...our waiter was super friendly - you could just tell the restaurant was severely understaffed. It looked like there was one waiter and one busboy for all the tables! The host was in the back helping clear tables while explained her absence.Food was awesome!! We got the French onion soup as an appetizer. My mom and I split the roast chicken with stuffing and brussels sprouts. My boyfriend got the special meat pie which was steak and mushrooms with chips. Sticky toffee pudding for dessert was delicious as well! Food could have been a little hotter (may have been sitting a bit before getting served since service was short) but overall not a big deal.I will definitely come back since the food was great and I love the décor and vibes in here!",0
"Food was good. The hummus with mushrooms and onions  was out of this world, as for main entrees nothing too memorable. The vibe of the place is quite nice, definitely a spot to hit with a group. My review is a bit subjective, but take what you will. Food is good for sure and felt clean and healthy, flavor wise maybe was missing some spice for me. I got the schnitzel salad, salad and dressing were amazing, loved the tahini coming through and mixed in some left over hummus from app for an extra hit. schnitzel was also good but was expecting some salt or spice from it which it was lacking, however they give you olives and peppers which you can add some spice with. We also got the pirogies which felt a little bland to me, although the caramelized onions on top were divine. I think this place is for sure a great spot to hit, especially with some friends so you can try a bunch of things. And I really respect that the food was healthy and clean feeling. I would come again and order a little different.",0
"Came here on a Sunday for brunch. I FINALLY got a chance to come here as it's been very difficult to make reservation. But this time, we somehow managed to make the reservation on Monday for this Sunday brunch. My friends and I got garganelli ($20), tagliatelle ($23), and tajarin carbonara ($23). All of them were SO DELICIOUS and al dente. I especially loved the gargaelli as the mushroom rage was extremely flavorful which I did not expect at all. Ricotta salata on top went very well with the pasta sauce as well. Tagliatelle and carbonara are both typical pasta but they were also super good. The portion size was good enough to make me feel content but it can definitely be not filling if I came here hungry. It's a good price for such delicious and quality pasta though. Next time, I do wanna try their roasted mushrooms appetizer as I've heard so many good things about it. The restaurant is also super pretty and has nice atmosphere, which makes it a perfect spot for a date night or occasion. Can't wait to come back here again!",0
"Came here on the late night around 3 AM and the place was packed! Not only was the food delish, but the service was not slacking and for 3 AM I was pleasantly surprised!. Wo Hop has been around for a minute and I definitely know why keep it up!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The Hawaiian atmosphere was wonderful and the food was top notch. I started off with the Pork Jowl musubi and it was really good. The next course was the Big-Eye Tuna Poke and it was amazing. The tuna was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed it. My friend ordered the Berkshire Pork Cutlet and I got to try a bite of it. It was really tasty. My second course was the Mochiko Chicken Loco Moco and it was also great. There was a lot of different flavors going on here and it all worked together well. My friend ordered the Mentaiko Tagliatelle and I tried a bite of it. It was really tasty. Finally, for dessert we shared the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake and it was amazing. I really enjoyed it. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Came here for a friend's bday dinner this past week and while there were certainly factors to be disappointed about, we had a great time overall. My friend made an 8pm reservation for her bday and yet we still found our group of 9 waiting in the smallest space possible by the hostess stand until almost 8:20. Thé claustrophobia and hanger definitely made a few in the group disappointed from the start, and the lack of care or attention from servers and even the manager didn't help. We were finally seated and started off with chips, salsa, and guac which were all great. We then put in our drink orders which ended up taking forever to come out. On top of this, we were unable to put in our actual orders for our food until 9pm. Wild. I guess they did a good job of setting us up for disappointment, as when peoples' orders came out, we were all in utter shock as to how small the dishes were. I was full on chips and only ordered Brussels sprouts so I was fine, but I've been to enough Mexican restaurants, having grown up in Texas, to know that you should get a heaping plate when you order a chicken quesadilla, which was absolutely not what ended up happening. The food itself was also mediocre at best, doing nothing to assuage anyone's disappointment. Service was generally slow throughout, but the servers were all definitely nice enough. We ended up having a good time as a result of being with each other, but the food and drinks were nothing to write home about. Other than the small portion sizes relative to the prices.",0
"Thank you for keeping things going during all this craziness. The staff is friendly and makes sure that even while dining outside, you have a great experience. Kudos to you all! Came in for brunch with a reservation (which I recommend) and got a nice dry spot under the awning and near a heater. Brunch is always delicious. The Nueske's bacon with pepper jelly and peanut butter is a must. And I opted for the Mezze & Eggs which was light and perfect. Two eggs with a smattering of tasty sides: beet tabbouleh, butternut squash puree, and farro. Yummy! My friend's short rib hash was the perfect warming dish for the outdoors. I would highly recommend to keep ya warm and cozy. I'll definitely be back as much as I can to support our neighborhood eats.",1
"Came for an after church brunch and was not disappointed. We made a reservation for 2 but had 2 other friends join us and they had no problem accommodating us. Even when we switched tables multiple times due to the sweltering heat, they just smiled and helped us get comfortable. We went with the bottomless mimosas which were the right amount of bubbly and delicious. For appetizer, we had the Brussels. They were soooo good. The chimichurri sauce was perfect. For my entree, I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was very good. It was spicy which i didn't realize before ordering, but the pickled strawberries  helped with that. Overall a wonderful brunch spot that I'll definitely be returning to.",0
Carbonara 10/10 - so good my bf keeps bringing it up 8 months later Cacio e peppe - sorry for butchering the spelling but this was also good! Although the fav was the carbonara Oysters were delicious Drinks were bubbly and nice for brunch Overall can't wait to come back!,0
"Max Brenner's makes you feel like you're in a Hallmark holiday movie. Something. About the lights, ambiance and huge bar filled with amazing service concocting drinks, and deserts feels like a wonderland. We ordered a little appetizer to get the night going. - so II h artichoke fondu. Don't let the name fool you. It was a small plate of cold spinach artichoke dip with stale chips. It was super subpar. It's fine I wasn't expecting the best dip ever. However the other food items they served looked really yummy. Okay let's get to the good part. Italian drinking chocolate. The taste of this hot chocolate will never leave my memory. I felt like it gave my soul a hug. I didn't know hot chocolate could make me feel so safe. This is definitely a DESERT. It's a treat that probably consist of a million calories... but don't think about that! Go enjoy this decadent magical drink. I will never stop talking about how this was the best hot chocolate I've EVER had. It IS sweet so I enjoyed sharing it. Also it comes in a cup called ""the hug mug""  UHM ...HOW CUTE!!! Service was 10/10 and the holiday spirit was lingering everywhere!",0
"Overall, Rib No 7 was pretty disappointing. The Beef Tartare was delicious, but the meats were very small for the price. The service was also pretty poor throughout the night. I don't think I'd come back here based on my experience.",1
"What a great place! Came here on a lark; couldn't be happier.I needed a stop-over before meeting a friend and wanted to try something new. Enter Ugly Kitchen. Situated conveniently in the East Village surrounded by lots of other places you'll be going to or coming from.Living in Little Manila, my standard for Filipino food is pretty high. What you're getting at Ugly Kitchen isn't good Filipino food, it's good Filipino with a twist -- which in a lot of ways is more interesting. I had the adobo chicken, which I've had dozens of times in dozens of places, but this was truly different. I felt like it was a classic dish, but made with a bar crowd in mind. It was on the menu as spicy, but be aware, it's not very spicy at all (unless you eat the hot pepper, but obviously right). The chicken itself was spicy enough to taste, but not to interfere.The staff was extremely friendly; I felt welcome and well attended to. I wish more places had the warm vibe that they had.Oh; also big plus is the music. You're going to have a good time here just listening to tunes and enjoying a beer if nothing else.Stop by Ugly Kitchen for some unique Filipino food. I'm going back for the Spam fries.",0
"I would say 4.5 stars.  Only reason not a ""5"" is that the green beans, though delicious, were pretty overcooked like canned green beans consistency.  Also, love their cauliflower (but same too mushy problem) and have also been to Miznon Paris.  The Paris location doesn't cook it mushy, it is cooked perfectly.  ***Chelsea, PLEASE find out from Paris what they do, as their cauliflower consistency is better than yours!***  However, had the cauliflower pita, delicous.  Lamb pita also delicous.",0
"It honestly blows my mind that Olio e Piu has 4.5 stars on Yelp.I've come here multiple times over the year for the vibe/location/ease of reservations/moderate pricing but never for the food. I've come with friends, co-workers and family. For birthdays, get togethers, and 1 on 1 catch ups. The food is consistently subpar. In my opinion, avoid the chicken and pizza at all costs and just go for a pasta instead.The service is friendly, but can get very slow.",0
"Overall, I had a decent brunch at Nice Matin. The prices are steep, but that is common on the UWS. They have a decent amount of outdoor seating and gives the impression of a french cafe. The service was pretty slow though they didn't seem that busy. I had the Benedict with lox which was good but not great.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Thai Market. The Thai green curry with chicken was delicious, and the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) with chicken was also great. I ordered spice level medium, but unfortunately was given mild (mild was written on the top of the container). The flavors were still amazing and the portion sizes were decent for the price. The Thai tea was also really good. There are several great Thai places in this area, which is a plus for me since I love Thai food, and Thai Market is definitely one of them!",1
Had a very disappointing experience at Viand. Our waitress was rude to us from the moment we sat down and gave me a difficult time when I asked for a new glass for water because mine had leftover lipstick on it. My girlfriend's pancakes were burned and the waitress was reluctant to replace them. My french toast was decent but nothing special. The nail in the coffin for me was having my card run at the table and then the waitress hovered over us while we tipped which I thought was unprofessional and not good service. I won't be coming back to Viand.,0
"Stumbled upon this joint with my friend and we both agreed this place was a solid restaurant.I ordered the chicken ""musakhan"" and my friend ordered the kebab halabi. We also shared bread with the hummus spread. The bread came super hot and freshly baked, sprinkled with sea salt. It was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend ordering it to start. The hummus was also very good. It was served with a very yummy olive oil and cooked chickpeas. Both entrees were very delicious and would definitely get it again, but if I had to choose one, I loved the chicken ""musakhan."" I'd describe it like a pizza because it was served on top of a thinner taboon bread with tahini and some greens.My friend got the Persian lemonade to drink, and it was sweet and floral and surprisingly, paired very nicely with the food.Overall a nice restaurant with a date night vibe.",0
"I had heard about this place for a while and it is definitely one of a kind. Nice big interior, with intricate murals help set the cozy feeling without being in a hole in the wall. I got the Meat Plate (what a fun thing to order), which was 4 pierogis, soup or salad, and a meat stuffed cabbage. Everything was great. A hearty, warm meal for a cold winter day. The vegetarian borscht was a surprise for me, as I didn't think I was a big beet-head. Well call me Mose Schrute because it was delicious.According to a local East Villager, Veselka is much busier now since people want to support Ukranian businesses. We went with 6 on a Monday and got in pretty quickly. The service is one of the most attentive I have ever experienced in my life as well.",0
"Overall, I had a good experience at Au Cheval. The burger was good, but the service was phenomenal. I stopped by for lunch solo and the host asked if I preferred a bar seat or a table, which I opted for. He seated me at a table without hesitation and I ordered a single burger with bacon and egg, as recommended by my server. I got the burger pretty quick and realized it was missing both the egg and bacon. I mentioned this to the waitress just so that I wasn't charged for the additional items. She came back a few minutes later and said that the burger was on the house, which was completely unnecessary but a welcome surprise. The burger was really good even without the egg and bacon, so other places could learn from Au Cheval's approach to customer service.",1
This rating is solely for the food. The restaurant has two floors. The upstairs I assume is for 2-4 guests while the downstairs area is for larger parties. I was apart of a birthday dinner so we got seated downstairs. I've seen this place all over my instagram feed and tiktok and heard about how good the food was so I was excited to try. I'm a pescatarian so I got the vegan empanadas to start and that was the highlight of my entire meal.  The empanada crust was super flaky and the seasoning for the filling was perfect. The sauce the empanadas came with had the perfect amount of spicy and really elevated the dish. For my main -- I got the shrimp and lobster mofongo which looked amazing! A+ for the presentation but this dish was SUPER SALTY. The sauce that it was drenched in was overpowering with the amount of salt that was used.. I was unable to finish it. I also got a side of mac and cheese that my friend and I shared and we were both super disappointed. The mac and cheese was extremely bland and lacked salt. Trying to use some of the mofongo sauce to season it didn't help either. Overall if I were to return it would be for the empandas and to try their drinks.,0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was beautiful and the service was great, however the food was not up to par. The bone marrow was very small and disappointing and the beef tartar was decent but not great. The monkfish was overcooked and rubbery and the oxtail was salty. The clams and shrimp were small, but the flavors worked well together in the mashed potatoes. The Brussels sprouts were sweet and charred, but also had a lot of bitterness. Overall, the food was okay but not great. I would recommend brunch over dinner.",1
"I had a great time at the Lexington! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was casual but elegant. The Brussels sprouts were really good, and the mac and cheese was really flavorful. The fried chicken sandwich was also good, but nothing really stood out to me. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant after reading great reviews online. I was not disappointed! The soba was amazing, and I was able to enjoy it multiple times after my initial order. The green tea ice cream was a great touch, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious and filling lunch.",1
"I had a good time at this restaurant, but the food wasn't great. I got the steak and it was pretty bland, but the poutine was really good. The drinks were also pretty good. I wouldn't go back for the food, but I would definitely come back for the poutine.",1
"I was a little skeptic after reading some of the reviews but I would say have no fear. Bond St sushi is amazing! The service is stellar, waiters and waitresses come around frequently and make sure every moment of my meal was perfect.For starters the tuna pizza is a must like all previous reviews state. Fresh tuna on a wafer thin crunchy crust. The fried rock shrimp was also fantastic, tossed in that mayo dressing. On to the sushi, all of the fish tasted fresh to me. Buttery soft and delicious. The Chilean Sea bass was tender, creamy and just the right amount of fat. Now my favorite was the steak, it was cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth flavorful goodness and paired with the fried potato cubes, nothing is better.  To end the night, we had the chocolate fondue, fresh fruits and fresh melted chocolate.",0
"I haven't been to Lazarra's in quite a while but I was happy to see that they were still serving delicious pizza. It might have been 10 years since I've been. Back in the day, it was packed and it was hard to get in. It's so incredibly sad to see the impact of Covid on this institution. The pizza was as how I remembered...saucey, flavorful and a delicious crust, served in a rectangular tray, which has probably been around since the restaurant opened. I gobbled down my pizza and enjoyed it so thoroughly. It's different from other pizza you'll get in NYC but soooo good. You could say it's a foodie's pizza. The Penn Station area used to be a bit of a food desert  but there was always Lazarra's. We also had a salad which was very tasty but the star was the pizza.  Lazarra's is a gem and an original. Order the pizza. Service was great also! Sorry. I was so hungry I forgot to take a photo. I'm sure there are plenty of their signature pie.",0
"I really hope Moonrise Izakaya (along with every other restaurant/cafe/bar) pulls through this horrible time. Not to be pedantic but even with dining-in no longer an option, every little bit (through ordering delivery, tipping generously, and buying gift certificates) counts. I'm particularly horrified on behalf of the newer restaurants that just opened their doors and now have to deal with this. There's really nothing quite like Moonrise in the UWS, where the dining landscape seems, for the most part, quite safe and homogenous.

I guarantee you are not going to be bored with the Sailor Moon decor. (Any chance the name is based on the brilliantly weird Wes Anderson film, Moonrise Kingdom?)

Came here with a few friends and were immediately offered a free shot of sake. Yes, indeed, I will take that trip back to college!

The menu is more or less Japanese pub food which, in my book, is multiples better than American bar grub. Don't skip the cheesy skillet corn, which is as much fun to eat as it looks, but eat it fast before the cheese cools and congeals. I liked their unconventional take on ma po tofu that's super sa",1
"We had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant - the space is gorgeous and the service was excellent. Our starters were both delicious, and we especially loved the Foie gras et volaille en gelée. The Quenelle de brochet, sauce américaine was also good. For our main course, we had the Sole Véronique and the Halibut. The Sole Véronique was delicious, but the Halibut was our favourite - it was very flavourful and cooked perfectly. Overall, an excellent dining experience - we would definitely recommend it!",1
I got the Salted Egg Yolk & Pork Floss Guokui.  It makes for a good midday snack because it's crispy and toasty.  I think there could've been more flavor to the filling like some garlic or scallions.,0
"The food was not great, but the ambiance and service were both decent. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Stylish Japanese pseudo-speakeasy.- Cocktails: Excellent. They incorporate their Japanese whiskies well- Ramen: unusual, actually. There's a strong fish component to their Kyoto Ramen broth, and if you're adventurous in terms of ramen you might like it. The noodles and fix-ins (egg, bamboo, pork belly) are standard.- Truffle Egg Sandwich - Buttery. The truffle flavor was strong. The bread was pretty good too: pillowy, sweet.- Service: They were pleasant but clearly overwhelmed. I'll give them a pass for growing pains.",0
"I came here after seeing great reviews on yelp, but I felt like my meal was just average. I chose the breaded chicken with rice and fries. I expected the rice to be seasoned with other vegetables and sauce, but it was plain rice. The fries were just fries. The chicken was good, but I felt like my meal was bland. I wanted to like my meal, but it was just okay. I would like to come here again and try something else to give it another chance but I was slightly disappointed by meal. I received the $4 sangria deal after checking in and I must say that was the best part of my visit. The sangria was not too sweet and had a nice flavor of different fruits. I would have gotten another one but one felt strong enough! Overall, I think this place is affordable given its location in NYC, but I wish there was more flavor to my meal.",0
"The bbq potato chips have an extra good crisp to them. I looooooved the ranch garlicky dressing that goes w it. I could spoon that on biscuits, ribs, etc... drop biscuits good, dense, and buttery. Slaw is the creamy kind good, I do it better though. Collard greens are good here- tender, chopped, swimming in its own jus. Chicken dry rub was dry. It reminded me of the shake and bake. Corn bread Madeline's are great - eat 'me while they r hot. Salt and pepper beef ribs are an honest 63/100, I give it a C+ grade. Not great but it also didn't fail. On the dry side. Not meaty. It's just showy. Baby back ribs were excellent -saucy and fall off th bone tender. Fries are fries.Service is nice and friendly when they come to your table but there were empty gaps of 15m where no one checked up for more drinks. We be thirsty peeps!!!! Key lime pie is a big Yes! Get it. Taaaaart w a buttery graham cracker and the whip cream balanced the tart. Banana cream pie is good but I also make that better.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was okay. I would have preferred if the seating was indoors, as it was a bit cold. The service was good.",1
"Zurutto Ramen & Gyoza Bar is a restaurant that I would not recommend. The food was cold and bland, and the pork buns were terrible. I was also very disappointed in the delivery guy's attitude. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"This was my first time trying indoor dining since the pandemic happened. Even though I'd prefer to sit outdoor if I dine at a restaurant, it was way too cold to even consider that option. They were able to seat us (5 people) right away. They did temperature checks and got the contact info of one person in the party in case they need to inform us of any potential exposure. When we were seated, they provided sanitizer for the table. I went into the restaurant thinking it was solely a ramen place. Their menu has more than just ramen though. I honestly think their ramen selection is a little lacking but they have a lot of options with rice bowls. I got myself the normal chashu ramen. It was good. The chashu was cut oddly thick and was tough which was a little disappointment. The broth was still very flavorful though. Because it was such a cold day, I really did appreciate the warmth of the broth but in terms of ramen, this place would not be my first choice.",0
"Noz Market is the acclaimed Michelin-starred sushi restaurant next door, and they have an outdoor dining service menu as well as different goods you can buy in the shop. The server explained to me that they use the same fish as Sushi Noz next door and have the same sushi chefs preparing it (not Chef Noz himself though, of course). He assured that the sushi chefs here are great and that the sushi set here is plain fish and nigiri, while the much pricier Sushi Noz has a wider selection, more fish, and dressed nigiri with toppings. The price for the sushi set here is about $85 - pricey yes but far from the $400 per person at Sushi Noz.

I really enjoyed the simple flavors of it. The tuna roll was great as well. We also ordered some salmon and tuna rolls and they were perfectly rolled and wrapped. It was wrapped tightly, no falling apart!, and delicious. If it wasn't so expensive, I probably would have ordered another 2 rolls.

The lychee ice cream for dessert was great as well. Only downside is that for this price - there are lots of other great sushi options in NYC. You could easily go somewhere else instead that has",1
"I stopped by Malaysian food spot near Washington Square Park and I was pleasantly surprised! The area is not the most vibrant, but the restaurant itself is cozy and the food is great. I ordered the sarawak laksa and it was delicious - very flavorful with a slight kick. The laksa was $20, but it's definitely worth it. I also ordered a pineapple fried rice which was great as well - their portions are a good size. I'll definitely be back for lunch!",1
China Gourmet is now open! I had a great experience ordering from here - the service was fast and the food was delicious. I especially recommend the General Tso's dish - it's my favorite Chinese takeout dish and China Gourmet did it justice!,1
"I absolutely love this place! One of the few restaurants I don't mind visiting again and again. Love their brunch and dinner vibes. It is a cute cosy restaurant, with some of the best music in town. I am usually busy shazamming the songs while dining here.

Everytime I go here, there service just gets better and better. Last week I dined here, resy had confirmed the reservation with me, but didn't notify the restaurant. Once we arrived there, the hostess( Sarah) couldn't find us in the system. Though the restaurant was packed, they managed to accommodate us and were very apologetic for the confusions caused by resy. They got us some complimentary shots and not just once, but twice because it was delicious!! They have a great selection of cocktails, and they make healthier versions by replacing sugar with agave. My fav dish is the Isaereli salad! So fresh and delicious. I end up ordering the same things usually- falafel latkes, hummus, shakshuka, the eggplant dish is delcious too!

Definitely stop by if you looking for some yum Mediterranean food, great music, and service!",1
"Had a glass of wine on the lovely terrace last night. Super friendly and prompt service, multiple no-frill options and reasonable prices. Other reviews are making me want to try the full menu so I'll be back soon!",0
"This restaurant is definitely worth checking out! The service is great and the food is delicious. I especially enjoyed the tuna tartar and salmon and tuna rice crisp apps. The only downside was the abundance of fruit flies, but that's definitely to be expected in a new restaurant. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.",1
The Wren is a beautiful restaurant with delicious food and drink. The decor is beautiful and the service was excellent. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.,1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Friedman's. The location in Herald Square is excellent, and the space is spacious. The selling point of this restaurant is that most of the items on the menu are gluten-free, and they definitely succeeded in making this waffle taste decent! The only downside is that the coffee and cappuccinos can be a bit watered down, but overall the staff is very friendly and attentive. Overall, I would definitely recommend Friedman's to anyone looking for a great gluten-free brunch option in Manhattan.",1
"A quick place to grab an Indian meal. Opted for the chicken tikka Kati roll, which was pretty flavorful. It was the perfect amount of heat. I wanted to try the paneer but they do not let you mix the orders. The service was quick around 830pm. The interior was spacious with plenty of seating. A good place for a quick bite.",0
"The pasta was overcooked and the meat dishes were meh. The chicken parm was the worst dish we had. The decor is much better than the food here. Unfortunately, the pastry shops are not as good as they used to be.",1
"5.5/10It hurts me to give this rating as I've been to this place at virtually every period of my life, albeit not particularly often, and the lady that works there has treated me well throughout the years. However, it seems that the quality has definitely fallen off: no sear on the dumplings and thus none of that crunch I have come to expect from fried dumplings, more often than not, they are pretty soggy; very oily, and unfortunately an oil that doesn't seem healthy or of high quality; meat has always been the defining factor in these dumplings and that hasn't changed, it is still very unique and tasty",0
"This place is better off being a regular sushi place rather than for omakase. Omakase is obviously better experienced sitting at the sushi counter but besides that, the sushi served was mediocre. There are better omakase experiences in the city for the same price. The craft of the pieces were okay but the fish was small. I expected to be served uni or squid pieces but the sushi pieces were that of normal sushi pieces you would get for plain nigiri. However, the waiter and host were very nice and great. The hot sake was delicious and sweet and paired well as a pallet cleanser. Side note, we ordered the miso soup and asked for a spoon and was told they don't have spoons and to drink from the bowl. Very traditional, I like the creativeness to produce less dishes!",0
"Lupa was really good in the summer the first time I tried it so I raves about this spot to my friends. We made reservations for 6 on a Sunday at 5:30pm. Lupa was already packed by then! We got seated all the way in the back and our sommelier was so helpful with us ordering a bottle of wine. We didn't hear any specials of the night from our waiter so we just ordered a bunch of things off the menu. We ordered 5 appetizers, 6 pastas, and 3 sides! I'm sad to say that our sides were the highlight of the night. We started with parm and added the Buffalo mozzarella. This was good but how can you really mess this up? The lobster burrata was one of the weirdest thing we had for the night, it was very fishy with a tiny little piece of lobster. The sauce was just really off and we didn't know what was wrong with it? The Arancini was okay, the green sauce under tasted very earthy was we weren't a fan of it. The crispy Brussels sprouts were the best appetizer. Our carbonara pastas were on the saltier side, the gnocchi was underwhelming and wasn't really something we wanted to finish, and short ribs ragu was alright. The sides: broccoli rabe, potatoes, and mushrooms were well seasoned, crispy, and flavorful. I think if you wanted to try something here, I would say order the sides, the carbonara, and parm with Buffalo mozzarella. I hope they adjust their salt levels and taste before sending it out, too.",0
"Pretty decent spot for mexican food with a great drinks menu. They have a happy hour but it seems like it ends at 6. Long story short, their food is really great but it's a little pricier than i would have preferred.We tried:- the mayan (drink) 9/10: it was an excellent mix of slightly sour and alcohol, wish there was a little more liquid..the drink was pretty small- la contenta nachos 8/10: nachos were pretty good and i liked the abundance and variety of toppings; but ultimately thought the price to portion ratio could have been better- tacos de carne asada 7/10: also quite yummy and the meat was incredibly tender -- but i'm personally not a fan of really expensive ""premium"" tacos- pollo en mole 9/10: i'm always on the lookout for mole dishes delicious mole and the chicken was surprisingly very juicy! only downside is the price",0
"Overall, our experience at this restaurant was good. The interior is cool, and the service is quite fast. However, the ramen is solid but I was disappointed that the egg came out hard boiled and wasn't poached as I've normally come to expect an egg served in ramen. Additionally, there was only one piece of pork belly in the whole bowl. I wish that our dishes were served at the same time and not one by one. Some of our dishes ended up staying on the table until everyone else was served, which can be uncomfortable for everyone to wait and not eat what's in front of them. I also wish that sushi was served individually by order, not all together on one plate. This caused some confusion and resulted in having to place an order for another roll. Overall, our experience was good and I would keep it in mind when looking for a quick bite in midtown.",1
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant! The Malaysian food was a great mix of Thai and Indian flavors, and the homemade roti canai (a type of Indian bread) was to die for. The beef rendang was also good, but I found it a bit too strong in flavor. The young Chow fried rice was also a great choice, and the spinach with shrimp paste was a nice addition. The only downside was that I didn't try the pearl noodles, but my friends said they were good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot to others and would love to come back myself!",1
"I really like the vibe of this place, the design and the feel are kool and welcoming and very much in line w ABC esthetic. The servers were really nice and the place ran like a well oiled machine. The dishes were good but after 3 plates we both left a bit hungry, the portions were really quite small, perhaps that's the way food should be and we r so used to enormous American sized portions lol",0
"I had a great experience at Urban Space! I was looking for a place to lunch and they had a great selection of items on their menu. I decided to try the Mama's Special Chicken and it was really good. It has hormone-free chicken, bamboo shoot, mushroom, eggplant in a sauce and it was really delicious. I was a bit thirsty afterwards, but that might just be because I love sauce! The meal took a while to come out, but it was still warm when I got back to my desk. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great lunch experience.",1
"Came here with friends on a Saturday. It was crowded. However, it doesn't take long to get a table. Once our party was ready, we were seated in 5-10min. The decor is nice. Staff is friendly. But the food came up very very slow!! I think it took 30-40 min for our food to come up after we placed the order. I remember I drank all my latte and my food was no where to be seen. Make sure you know what you want before seated and just order them right away!! The burger-8/10. Juicy and tastyBanana bread French toast-6/10. Didn't taste like a French toast. More like a sweet banana bread. Very filling and sweet. The chai latte-5/10. The flavor is just ok, too sweet for mebBQ Brekkie bowl-7/10. My friend wasn't impressed by itOverall the service is good. Food is decent. Just remember to order your food really quick otherwise you'll wait at least 30min for it.",0
"I feel like I'm back in undergrad at this part. This is a loud, young, and fun restaurant. Their sister restaurant located next door closed. The sister restaurant was cozier and smaller, and this restaurant is bigger and louder. For bar food it's decent although a little pricey. I hate that they don't have a happy hour",0
"I had a great time at Panna II Garden Indian Restaurant! The food was really good and there was a lot of it. The downside is that it can be really loud in there, and it can be tough to hear the person next to you. But overall, it's a great place to go for a casual meal.",1
I had a great experience at Hanoi House! The person on the phone was so friendly and my order was made quickly. The viet coffee I ordered was perfect and I loved the spicy garlic cauliflower app. I would definitely come back here.,1
"I was disappointed with my experience at Beyond Sushi - the restaurant was ""dine in experience only"" which was not mentioned when I ordered on the app, and I was not allowed to eat my food there. The sushi wasn't as good as I'm used to at other locations, and the rice was kind of hard. The bar service was okay but I wasn't particularly impressed. Overall, I would not recommend this establishment.",1
"I absolutely loved Northend! It's such a great food hall with only two restaurants and a bar, but the food is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend the Brussel Mac and cheese from Harlem Public. They give a really generous portion and I had a enough for lunch the day after. The hot fried chicken sandwich is also really good.",1
This restaurant is fantastic! I've never been before and saw it had a delivery option so I decided to give it a try. I ordered a salad and pasta with mushrooms and sun dried tomato in a cream sauce and both were really good. Super fast delivery too! I definitely recommend if you're in the midtown area!,1
"Overall, I had a great time at Crave Fishbar. The food was delicious and the service was great. I only had one issue with the omelette and that was quickly resolved. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit too large for my taste and it could use some more love. However, the Puls'd deal made it worth it. I would definitely come back here.",1
This review is for The Rag Trader as I am yet to try Bo Peep (located downstairs) Ok when I say I love it here I LOVE it here. I've been about 4 times all different days of the week and every time I come my guests and I always leave happy.Ambiance: there is always a vibe and a crowd any day of the week after 6pm. Whether ive gone Monday or Friday there is always a cool crowd here. They also have lovely outdoor seating for anyone who wants to dine that way before harsh winter comes along.Staff: always so friendly and attentive. Always beat you to asking if you want another drink or refilling your waterFood and Drinks: Between my visits and my groups I've seen almost every item on the menu and have never heard one person complain! The mac and cheese is a MUST. Drinks are all hand crafted and taste divine. Ill always splurge on getting two or three drinks while there because they are so tasty! This is a great option for dinner as its walking distance to both Penn Station and Port Authority so those who work in the city and live in the surrounding areas can get home quickly!,0
"Ok so I am a ramen lover and this place is legit one of the best in NYC. It's so flavorful and fresh that every time you try it, it's just as good as the first bite. Staff are professional and friendly and menu is not over complex, you know what you're getting.Easy to see why this place is so highly regarded. Make reservations for sure!For $20 the ramen was delicious and $15 appetizer was perfect with it! Good portion and atmosphere :)",0
"Great spot for groups, garden outdoor seating in the back, friendly fast service with okay food. There were a bunch of us so we got to try a lot of different stuff. We got:- breakfast taco: cheesy but not great... cant really describe it because it was just... mix of all kinds of flavor. Bizarre is the best way to describe. Won't get it again - chicken swarms taco: dried out chicken, won't get it again - Brussel sprouts taco: awesome alternative to meat tacos. Would get it again! - spicy guac: actually has a bit of heat so would get it again over regular guac. LOVED the crispy fresh chips - corn on the side: it's not on the Cobb, and it has a bit of a kick which I appreciate. For the price, it's probably not enough portion but GREAT flavor. - spicy shrimp: probably the only taco I'd recommend. Overall, ive bad better tacos. It wouldn't be my place to get tacos... but their side dishes were great and the service was awesome. Aside from tacos (what they are known for), I'd recommend the place. Just be careful ordering tacos? I'd say 6.5 Gryffindor points out of",1
"I just had a great meal at this restaurant. The pork katsu donburi was amazing and nicely presented. I liked how they put 3 different sides with it. And the price was also affordable at $13.06. I didn't have to wait too long to get the food either. I had a bad experience once in here before the pandemic, but it seems like the service has gotten nicer since then. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Time & Date: Sunday, 7/25/21 @ 7:40pmReservation: not needed for bar, recommend for tableCrowd: busy, bar full & almost all tables fullLocation: top floor of the Refinery HotelI specifically came to this rooftop bar to try the frosé (and also for the ambiance), and it was pretty good! This drink has rosé, vodka, peach liqueur, simple syrup, lemon juice, orange juice, and strawberry. I was actually shocked at how strong the alcohol flavor came through. Keep in mind that if you don't have a reservation, there might not be tables available. However if you just want a drink, you can grab a seat at the bar if there is space. The drink was a whopping $18, but I guess that's what you should expect from a NY rooftop restaurant bar!",0
"I was really unimpressed with Aroy Dee Thai Kitchen. The food was outrageously expensive, and it did not help that the food was uninspiring and unimpressive. The Thai iced tea was the only thing I enjoyed, but my two entrees were quite forgettable. The Drunken Noodles have a minimal kick, and the noodles are highly undercooked. There is not enough flavor and the whole thing seems to taste rather dry and bland, rather than tasty and extravagant. The Tom Yum soup I had is also pretty sweet. There is very little umami flavor to the soup, which is what is supposed to make the soup a powerhouse. Instead, it felt like it was missing key ingredients, despite the plentiful squid and shrimp it came with. At least the soup had plenty of noodles, and unlike the noodles in the Drunken Noodle, these were cooked all the way through. The customer service was spotty too. Clearly they need to hire more people to keep up during a lunch rush. The cute girl behind the counter is not enough to satisfy a big crowd.",1
"Overall, I had a mixed experience at Patrick's. The drinks were good, but I would recommend the excellent $8.50 Bloody Mary over the ""special Brooklyn"" $13 gin & tonic. The Sigmund Hot Pretzels app was excellent, two large crusted pretzels served with dipping sauce. However, the main courses fell short. Neither of us got sides with our sandwiches so we shared a side order of so-called French Fries which were actually greasy circular chips. My Montauk tuna sandwich was bland, small and priced at $23, inflated even for the theater district. The cheesecake dessert was stuffed into a cup and covered with sweet jam, not my preferred style. Our server was pleasant but very busy, and the place didn't employ any buspersons when we were there, so we ate our dessert with dirty plates on the table that hadn't been cleared away. Overall, I had a mixed experience at Patrick's and I'm not sure I'd go back.",1
"I was so excited to try this place and really wanted to love it. I ordered it delivered and everything started great, pizza was hot and looked delicious. First few bites were great too! However on one bite I noticed a really chewy bit I couldn't chew no matter what. I spit it out to discover it was a piece of cardboard that had been baked into the slice, and was absolutely disgusted. Didn't even want to touch the rest of the pizza after that. So yes the pizza here is good but apparently you have to watch out for random objects baked into it, I read another review before ordering that said they found a piece of a staple in their pizza and I laughed it off but now I'm 100% sure they were serious. Seems that this place has some health and safety issues, which is really unfortunate.",0
"I was really excited to try out Panna II Garden Indian Restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was not great. The restaurant is really beautiful, but the food was greasy and the waiters were water aggressive. One thing that was really offputting was the way the front door was handled. We were witness to alot of infighting between the hosts and another neighboring restaurant.  Also, the menu should come with photos if the waiters cannot explain the dishes being served. What I expressed interest in was not what I got.",1
"Overall taste is as good as the other kazunori. Came here on a Friday night and there was no wait which was amazing considering I probably would have waited at least an hour at the other location. I don't think this will last long though once word gets out. Also located in a food hall, so you could probably grab a drink or something while you wait.   The only critique I have is the hand rolls were rolled a little looser than what I'm used to. Doesn't have as good a hand feel, but the taste itself is just as good.",0
No complaints about the food. I loved the drunken noodles and the red curry was good as well. It was not too spicy but it had just enough kick to it. I just wished they had more noodles on the plate for the drunken noodle. The place really IS a small Thai kitchen. Not alot of space but there weren't too many people eating when I was there so it was fine. I also had a Groupon for 20 bucks worth of food for 10 bucks.,0
"Overall, I thought the food at this restaurant was just ok. The fried shrimp and calamari were my favorite dish, but I wasn't too impressed with the caprese salad or the pear ravioli. The chicken parmesan was also good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the shrimp and calamari. The tiramisu was my favorite of the three desserts we ordered, and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Viand Diner is not the same as it once was. The quality of the food has gone down, and it's now overpriced. The service is old school and this can be costly. I used to love going to Viand on East 86th Street, but this Beacon location is not up to par. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"First off, let me say that this is nice venue and cool spot to hangout. I would say that I am usually comfortable with Manhattan prices, accounting for the type of restaurant, location, day, etc. But the main turn off about this place is that they charge $19 for cocktails. Yikes! Yes, granted they seem to have happy hour specials, but not on a random sunday evening? C'mon how many people go out on a sunday evening and want to pay full price? I was joking with my friends that I can step into any fancy restaurant in midtown and pay this price. Just as a barometer, it costs $17 for a nice cocktail at Death & Co. which specializes in such drinks. In my humble opinion, the environs don't justify the $19 price tag. They have relatively high end prices for their beer as well in the $8 range. So go when they have some deals but I would hesitate otherwise unless you are feeling flush or have a trust fund :)",0
"Bay lander was a great little find. After passing it everyday for what feels like a year, I finally decided to stop.The food is good, nothing spectacular, but the food combined with the vibe makes it a great place to go with friends or family.I HIGHLY recommend the Asian Chili Calamari they were the highlight for me. Additionally the lobster rolls were spot on.The Margarita's are served in cute patron bottles, and totally instagrammable if that's your thing.",0
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this Smith location yet. It's in my neighborhood and it's my go to spot for first dates, dinner with girl friends or solo brunching. I pretty much always get their kale, quinoa salad with chicken/salmon and fries. I only like skinny fries and smith does it just right! Repeat customer here!",0
"Cute little brunch place in the SoHo area. They have a variety of outdoor seatings set up, with little private ""greenhouses"" of sorts that are honestly pretty cramped (we were seated here, and it was difficult to do much more than sit and face the table). The food is good though, albeit a little expensive for what it is. We did not get good service here (no one checked on us throughout our meal, and we had to go inside to chase down a server to bring us the check). Unfortunately, I don't think I would come back given the service was pretty mediocre. If looking for outdoor seating, I recommend waiting for one of the outdoor tables that are not in the greenhouses.",0
"Dumplings have finally arrived on the UWS!  Vanessa's just opened up last week on Amsterdam Ave.  We walked by Friday night, grabbed a paper menu but the line was too long and we didn't want to wait.  We returned the next day (Saturday) around 3pm and ordered a huge dinner to take home and binge watch ""The Boys"" - ordered 6 different types of dumplings and two noodle dishes (sesame peanut sauce noodles and dan dan spicy beef noodles.  The price was reasonable about $60 total and even though there were around 8-10 customers ahead of us, we only waited 15 minutes before the server came outside and handed us our takeout.  Our favorite dumplings were the boiled Spicy Wontons with shrimp and chicken and the Spicy Beef.  These are NYC American-Chinese-style dumplings.  The wrappers are pretty thick and we couldn't really distinguish the different fillings (except for the Chive & Pork boiled dumplings, the Spicy Wontons 红油抄手 and Spicy Beef dumplings).  I surprised myself that I liked their Dan dan noodles with Spicy Beef.  I am usually not a spicy girl.  But the heat was manageable, even welcoming on a cold night.  This is not a Din Tai Fung Michelin star level dumpling house but it's a solid addition to this dumpling-starved neighborhood.",0
"The chicken tikka masala was definitely the star of the show! It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of spice. The butter chicken was also good, but I thought it was a little too heavy on the creaminess for my taste. The samosas were also very good - especially the lemon ones. The dessert was also a hit - definitely a must-try!",1
"I have been wanting to visit Lil Frankie's for a long time but never had the opportunity to go. I was feeling like a treat during the lockdown (before all the restaurants had outdoor spaces) and ordered the Spaghetti Limone and the Mezzi Rigatoni Polpettini Ragu as a treat during that period. I loved the Spaghetti Limone, despite how heavy it was. It was a very unique pasta dish unlike one I've had before. I think I would return to Lil Frankie's just to see how this dish lives up when you eat it in person instead of eating at home. I still think about getting it sometimes. The Mezzi Rigatoni Polpettini Ragu in comparison was fine but something about it reminded me of Spaghetti-O's? I did not find it as enjoyable as the Spaghetti Limone and would likely pass on ordering it going forward.This seems to be a solid pasta/pizza joint and I will definitely return. Based on my experience, it is slightly above a 4 rating but I did not think that the quality of the rigatoni justified making my review a 5.",0
"I suggested coming here to a friend after our other plans fell through on a warm Tuesday night. When we entered, there was a lone patron sitting at the bar and my friend and I were seated immediately. The menu was a bit hard to gauge and we struggled to decide on what to order. We ended up deciding on the pickle sandwich, lamb ribs and tile fish. The pickle sandwich was buttery and vinegary. Quite different than any sandwich I have had but good in its own right. But after seeing other customers order the burger, I felt we had made a mistake in our menu choice. Next came out the lamb ribs. As we were sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen prep area, we saw them cutting the ribs for us. They had quite a large rack of ribs they were cutting and we assumed we would get 3-4 ribs to share amongst the 2 of us. We were shocked at the portion served to us... it was nearly the entire rack! Considering the price charged, it was an extremely good deal. The lamb ribs were fatty and flavorful - a great choice if you like smoky lamb. To be honest, the pickle sandwich and the ribs were more than enough food for the two of us but we had ordered the tile fish already so we tried a bit of that. The tilefish was served in a Japanese dashi ankake like sauce with zucchini. This was a nice fish but did not suit the lamb ribs choice well. I probably would not order this again but it was nice in its own right. All in all, we had a great experience at the bar here. Our bill ended up being a little less than 60 for the two of us (service is included in this) which is a real steal for a 2 star Michelin restaurant. I will definitely be back to try more at the bar in the future.",0
"I love this spot. Always a great place to meet friends for lunch, dinner or brunch. Excellent cocktails and yummy food. This past time, I got the lobster salad and it was perfect, prosecco and a had a vodka club soda. My friends had Mac and cheese and some other amazing food. Great service, great location, clean abs Covid friendly",0
"I decided that i really wanted to visit the Chelsea market. I had my heart set on going to the Lobster Market. They open at 11am and it was only 9:30am so i had alot of time to kill.The last time i visited here was pre-pandemic. I would always grab the pre-packaged shrimp with cocktail sauce. I love the Lobster bisque here. It's delicious.  At 11am i walked over to Lobster Place. This place is amazing. It's the absolute BEST when it first opens. I wasn't the only one waiting to get in. There was at least 10 people waiting. So once the lunch crowd comes in, its not as peaceful. This place is popular and for good reasons. I sat immediately at the Oyster bar, that's what i went for. They checked my vaccination card and every other person who walked in and sat down. I was able to get my order in really quickly. I first ordered 6 oysters and a diet coke. I got the merasheen bay, coleville bay, eel lake, duxbery gem, orient point pearl and widow's hole. I loved them all. There were two smallers ones that i loved the best. Too bad i didnt know which was which. I wish they told me which was which. I would of only ordered more of those two i completely loved. But honestly they were all so good i ended up getting a second order. I ended up eating 12 oysters all by myself. Overall i really enjoy coming here. Its honestly best to come early. The lunch rush is bananas and can be overwhelming. I was able to take my time. Everyone inside was so nice, patient and attentive. The service was great.I cant wait to come back.",0
"I came to celebrate two friends who had just quit their jobs that day, and the table bread brought out at the beginning was decent. They served it with a lightly spiced bean and olive oil side that was good, though I didn't quite get the beans and ended up just dipping in the oil. I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and the sauce was delicious but the pasta was too overcooked for my taste, something I was quite surprised by. All in all, this would have just been a three star experience but they threw in some free dessert and a cute little celebration at the end. Tip: bring bug spray if you are dining on the patio in the summer--they don't have any for customer use!",1
"I was not very impressed with the food options at this restaurant. My friend and I shared the pork belly flatbread and the linguini. I've had much better flatbreads in Syracuse NY and for a much better deal. The linguini was also nothing special. Since this place has generally good reviews, I wonder if we just happened to pick the worst choices on the menu and that we would have been less disappointed with something else.",1
"I absolutely loved this restaurant when I first went and it's one of my favorite spots in the city. The wait can be a bit long, but the food is definitely worth it. I especially recommend the fish cake soup, mentaiko pasta, and volcano roll. The vodka sodas are also delicious.",1
"Was easily able to make a reservation for 7 on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was quiet and would be perfect for a date night. Food is very reasonably priced, as well as the wine. We enjoyed the steak, short ribs, and salmon. Service was great.",0
"I got take out for the crispy dough wrapped with steamed rice noodle ($5). Flavor was bland and oily (they gave tiny cups of soy sauce and sweet sauce) and the texture of the crispy dough was too hard. Enough people I know like this place that id try something else, but there's way better in this heart if chinatown!",0
"I was so pleasantly surprised by Bond St sushi! The service was amazing and the food was really good. The tuna pizza is a must, and the steak was cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I was really excited to see all the homes in dyker heights decorated in extravagant lights and other Christmas decorations. Unfortunately, I was not very pleased. I live in Chicago and there are many suburbs nearby that have significantly better decorations.  I was honestly shocked by how many homes in dyker heights that were not decorated. It seemed like 3-5 homes per block were decorated. I would say overall there were only 4 memorable homes. I was hoping for more Christmas joy than I experienced. Not too sure if this was normal or if less people decorated this year. Besides the big homes, the decorations were very average.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. I ordered a crispy chicken taco and a fish taco, and they were both really good. The prices were really reasonable, and the place was very clean. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Great margaritas, good prices during happy hour and chips and guacamole to snack on. The Maya margarita is delicious, and there's great seating in the bar area with a cool lounge vibe.",0
"The outside of this restaurant is absolutely beautiful, and the atmosphere is really cozy and inviting. However, we were not very impressed with the food. It was overpriced and not very well seasoned. We shared the crab and lobster tacos, and the tuna crispy rice. For the money, you can get a better meal somewhere else.",1
"This place boasts a wide variety of dim sum and Chinese entrees. The dim sum is on a separate menu and we had to specifically ask for it. We visited with a party of 5, and there were enough options to accommodate for everyone's dietary restrictions. However, for those with any allergies, I would recommend reading the menu very, very carefully. As somebody with shellfish allergies I didn't expect there to be dried shrimp in sticky rice chicken and turnip cake (many other dim sum restaurants don't include the ingredient), and found out after enthusiastically biting into the food...We ordered a few dim sum items, a stir fried garlic yuchoy, chicken claypot, and Hong Kong style noodles. My favorite was the salted egg yolk buns and chicken claypot. The salted egg yolk buns had a delicious, runny filling that infused the fluffy dough with flavor. The chicken was first fried, giving it a nice crunch, and then tossed in a soy-based glaze with other veggies (onion, shallots, and mushrooms). Nothing else left too much of an impression. The scallion pancake was a bit dry and the noodles were soggy and lacked flavor. The restaurant was very crowded and loud, and I had trouble hearing my friends across the table, but definitely a vibrant venue if you are seeking that kind of ambiance. Overall, I expected more out of a dim sum restaurant with multiple locations across the city.",0
"We visited the Ainsworth for Sunday brunch and had a generally mediocre experience. The food was decent, though not particularly remarkable. The waitstaff was a bit brusque, a bit slow, and not especially friendly. The venue was generally nice, with a cozy and welcoming ambiance. Our group certainly still managed to have a nice time together, but the restaurant experience itself was quite unmemorable.",0
My favorite dumplings in the city! I come get once a week! So fresh and flavorful. Love their monthly specials and soup so delicious.,0
"This little restaurant tucked away along West 4th Street is a great option if you're looking for a quick and easy meal. The menu is straightforward and the options are plenty, including a carne asada taco that I ordered. The food arrived within a few minutes, and included the works of lettuce, salsa, and guacamole. The taco itself was thankfully double wrapped, so the ingredients didn't spill out as I took a bite. The flavor of the salsa and guacamole was good, but the meat itself was a bit generous. Overall, a good quick eats option in the area.",1
"I had a wonderful time at Quality Bistro! The atmosphere was perfect, the cocktails were delicious, and the food was fantastic. I especially loved the Detroit Tarte Flambee appetizer, which was so flavorful and filling. The steak was also cooked perfectly, and I really enjoyed the truffle butter topping. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",1
This was one stop during my trip to NY. Girlfriends and I came here for brunch. This place is really lovely with all the decor and quiet vibe. We were seated upstairs and enjoyed super tasty food and drink. This was definitely an experience and the portions were perfect starter for us since we headed out to another brunch later that day ! Our waiter was so amazing didn't get his name ( possibly Michael) he answered all our questions . He recc the espresso cuckootini which was amazing and my first time trying this. I'm not a chocolate fan but quickly became a fan of this drink ! I would def return ! Enjoy these cute pictures !,0
"4.5 stars rounding down to 4. Came here for lunch and unfortunately the service was slow but I heard that two servers called out. The ambiance is super chic and cute!The prices are pretty expensive so be prepared. I tried the toro scallion, scallop, spicy tuna, poke tuna, yellowtail scallion and salmon cucumber. All of them were delicious but my favorites were the toro and spicy tuna. One thing to note for that hand rolls is that they come with removable plastic (they probably keep them there to maintain the shape of the hand roll); however, they aren't that effective when removing and sometimes the filling can spill out. Overall, the quality of the fish was amazing and I loved the amount of wasabi they put into the rolls for that perfect kick. The flavors were great!",0
"Our Restaurant Week takeout was tasty and intriguing.- Octopus Pasta: so extraordinarily seafood-y. For sure the flavor of octopus was layered into the sauce itself. Although the (perfectly al dente) pasta looked and felt dry, each bite was intensely perfumed. The chunks of octopus meat nestled perfectly in the shapes of the pasta, which was funny.- Sweet Italian Pork Sausage: the fix-ins were excellent, including these delicious sauteed greens (friarielli Napoletani?) and rosemary roasted fingerling potatoes. The two stumpy little sauces tasted strongly of fennel and brought me back to those street fairs downtown where the Little Italy stores line up and serve similar-tasting sausages with peppers and onions on a roll. It wasn't the best taste memory, but I didn't mind it.- The order also came with six slices of bread, half of which tasted like cranberry walnut.",0
"Overall, I was disappointed with the food at this restaurant. Several dishes were just off - the chicken tikka was dry and flavorless, the naan bread arrived 10 minutes after our entrees, and the lamb kebab was nothing like a true kebab. However, the biryani dishes were very good. I would recommend giving this restaurant a try if you're looking for some Indian food, but be aware that not all of their dishes are winners.",1
Decided to try the infamous  $1.00 per slice of cheese pizza while strolling Times Square area.Staff are friendly and pizza are ok - it's New York Style  thin crust with a very thin layer of cheese- the quality is average for the price paid for.It's worth to visit especially for on the go and on the run snacking and quick bites.,0
"I had a nice lunch with some friends here on a Saturday. In order to make a reservation we had to put a $20 deposit fee per person in the reservation. That money is then put towards your bill on the date of your reservation. 

I wish the weather was a bit warmer because it is all outdoor and on the water so a little chilly. There is a pretty small food and drink selection which was disappointing. And most options were only seafood, there's 1 burger option on the menu with meat. I really liked the oysters I had and also enjoyed the lobster Mac n cheese, some of the best I ever had!!!! The octopus portion was disappointing, very small. The wait staff was nice and didn't rush us off the table which I appreciated. I'll be back when the weather warms up.",1
"I stopped by Little Basil in the Kips Bay neighborhood for lunch today and I was really impressed! The atmosphere is really cute and I was the only customer in the dining room. They have a lot of different options for fried rice, and I chose the medium spice level. The fried rice was great, and I really loved the little basil bits in it. The service was great, too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!",1
"Nice variety of Vietnamese food found in a convenient location in Chinatown. Nothing too special or particularly unique. Our party of 5 had to wait quite some time to be seated and the server unfortunately thought we wouldn't need tea throughout our meal. Then we were kind of rushed out towards the end of the meal, since it seemed like they had a line forming again",0
LOVE this place! The octopus appetizer and the green tagliatelle with truffle cream were amazing. Big portions and great flavor and pasta texture. The only thing is that the place is super small and tight-- so it gets a little uncomfortable when people are trying to get in and out of their seats. But the food makes it worth it and the prices are great.,0
"I visited this restaurant and it was a great experience. The outdoor seating is really nice and they have individual heat lamps. The servers have masks and the food was really good. I especially loved the burger and fries which were savory and juicy. The chili was hearty and warming, with a lot of beef. I didn't enjoy the focaccia as much, though. The service was a little slow in getting our food and it took a while for us to receive our check. However, the worker who was handling the seating and bathroom line was really rude and snapping at customers. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere, and the service was great. However, the food didn't live up to the hype. We ordered the chicken satay x2, chicken lettuce wraps, Beijing chicken and soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were good, but the chicken satay was as delicious as they say, but that's about it. The rest of the food that we ordered was mediocre & not worth $140. I would come back, but for now this place deserves a solid 3.",1
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The food was amazing and the service was fantastic. The only thing I didn't like was that it was quite busy, but that's to be expected in a place like this. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious Vietnamese meal.",1
"The service was fantastic and the music lively, making for a great night out. I especially enjoyed the fried rice - it was the best I've ever had. The eggplant side dish was also great. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the lobster noodles.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with St James Gate. The drinks were average and the atmosphere was a little sketchy. Additionally, the dog inside was a bit of a nuisance.",1
I came to this restaurant for my friend's birthday and it was a lot of fun. The service was really fast and the food was really good. I especially loved the fried chicken wings and the seafood pancake. The chicken wings were really big and juicy and the sauce had a good kick to it. The seafood pancake was also really good - there was a lot of seafood in it and it was really crispy. I would definitely come back here.,1
"Its my first time at Tenth ave and it was for a girls brunch. Place is super cute! The staff was so welcoming and always had a smile on their fave. Service was fast as well. We enjoyed the hour and half sangria and mimosas special. My party had the ceviche, salad, salmon, chimi burger and I had the shrimp linguine. We all loved our food. Our bartender Joanna was super fun and made our brunch so much more fun. We enjoy shots and laughs with her. We are definitely coming back!  Thanks guys for the great hospitality!",0
"Such a big fan of Bodega Negra! I came here with four girls on a Saturday night for dinner and it was perfect. This place has a really good vibe and is perfect for dinner/drinks before a night out. The service here is also great - our server Lawrence was fun, nice and attentive. We each had one app, tacos and one drink and we got out of here for less than $50 per person. I had the Skirt Steak tacos, the Grilled Corn Salad and tried the Yuca Fries and the Sweet Plantains (plain without the cheese or crema) and everything was so good! I also asked for a custom tequila drink which was awesome. I would definitely recommend Bodegra Negra for a good group dinner that won't break the bank.",0
"Only a short walk from my hotel, but very disappointing...Out server seem to be incredibly busy for a Monday night as we had to ask for refills and drinks several times. The drinks were very expensive and extremely strong but tasted awful, super let down there.order the mussels, yuca fries which were actually fantastic, and brussel sprouts which were so soaked in sauce it was practically inedible...the bacon was over cooked and extremely chewy.. probably won't go back sadly",0
"My favorite Cheung fun place in NYC hands down! I always get the curry fish ball cheung fun large with all the sauces. If I'm feeling differently then I'll go for the shrimp cheung fun. Their cheung fun is perfectly chewy and slippery and you get to see them make it right in front of your eyes! Their congee is also delicious, as well as their soy milk. You can't really go wrong here and the Cantonese aunties make me feel right at home. They are cash only and expect a wait if you go on the weekends - they are a hard working crew and the wait can be long sometimes but always worth.",0
I ordered the Black Tan Tan Ramen ($20) and I was a bit shocked by the portion size as it was tiny. Taste was not bad. Only thing I am super curious about is the portion size when viewing other people's pictures. I have eaten at Karrakata and like it a lot better. The portion size there felt more fair as well as the taste was more stronger. Interesting because I read that they were owned by the same owner so mega shocked about the inconsistency in taste and portion size.,1
"I really liked Pure Thai Cookhouse, but it didn't blow me away like I thought it would given all the hype. I have tried coming here a few times prior, but the wait is generally incredibly long, given how small the restaurant space is. I came on a Thursday night at 9:30pm with two others and still ended up waiting around 45 minutes.I ordered the wok basil with chicken based off of the recommendation of Yelp and the pad kee mao with chicken. The basil with chicken was really good. It doesn't look like much more than a lot of ground chicken with a few peppers, but it's really flavorful (borderline overly salty), and the white rice that comes with it complements it well. It definitely had some heat to it, so be forewarned. The pad kee mao was also delicious. I loved the wide noodles they used, and the portion size was pretty generous. I really enjoyed Pure Thai cookhouse but wouldn't wait more than 45 min for it again, especially given how many Thai restaurants there are in the area. I slightly prefer the likes of Up Thai and SomTumDer more.",0
"Overall, we were incredibly disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. The drinks were very watery, the bartender was clumsy and apathetic, and it took him 25 minutes to give us water we asked for repeatedly. We also felt that he was unapologetic about the situation. If we ever return, we will amend our review.",1
"Food, atmosphere, and service were all 5/5. My favorite dish is the Toro Ssambap and I would order this every single time I'm here. It's the perfect amount to share between two people (but I would honestly just order an entire one just for myself). The Wagyu Ramen was also insane - the wagyu just melts in your mouth. The Truffle Bimbimyun was also good but will probably not order it again. They do not skimp on the truffle!! It was just a bit too heavy and hard to finish for me.",0
"Great vegetarian-friendly spot for a quick and tasty lunch. I really enjoyed the vegetable dry pot. It's a melange of delicious tofu cubes, broccoli, cabbage, and seaweed and comes with a choice of white or brown rice. GaGa would be a great spot for lunch next time you have jury duty or find yourself in the financial district for some other reason!",0
"Great time at the Yard House tonight. It's a Thursday night and there is a 20 minute wait  but the hostess is super friendly. However, after 5 minutes we find 2 seats at the bar, so we cancel our table reservation. At the bar Jasmine is so friendly with a great smile. We ordered  are drinks and two appetizers; Fire Cracker Shrimp & Buffalo Tenders. The Fire Cracker shrimps were very tasty and came with what I would call hash browns on the bottom of the shrimp. The Buffalo Tenders were just too hot for me but made with good chicken. I also ordered a Grilled Chicken Creaser Salad which was delicious.Overall, great service... good food, I'd come back.If you like an amazing selection of beers, you are in for a treat.",0
"I've been here about 3 times now and I always seem to have the same impression. I keep coming back because the drinks are good and the ambiance is amazing but the food isn't so great. I came here on a Sunday night with my 3 girl friends. I'd say that this is a good date spot. The service was amazing. The ambiance was cute with vintaged influenced interior. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. I loved the complimentary bread & olives. We shared both appetizers and entrees for the table. We started off with the polipo alla griglia and mozzarella di bufala. For entrees we split the fettuccine tartufo, burrata & lemoncello ravioli, and fresca e pesto. Would I come back? Yes. Probably wouldn't come back to eat a full meal but would definitely come back to catch up with a friend over drinks and some appetizers.",0
"Very intimate, wonderful omakase experience. The omakase is a great deal for what you pay for (approx. $125, but you can choose to add on pieces and customize your experience ahead of time). It's tucked away on a side street near Chinatown/Tribeca, where there's not much else happening but this tiny place serves delicious pieces of nigiri and great drinks to go along with it. The sake pairing was excellent. They also sell adorable tea cups with sushi/nigiri painted on. Not related to food, but excellent. We met a few very interesting people there as well, and it lends itself to the omakase diners for each time slot getting to know each other over the course of the meal. It's not as high falutin feeling as some other omakases, and feels accessible without taking away from the fancy dining experience.",0
"I had the chance to stop in today for a quick bite with my wife. That quick bite turned into three slices for me and two for her. Seriously. She was going to have just one. She talked herself into another one because she liked it. It's 3 star pizza in my mind compared to others I've had in Manhattan. But it's a solid three stars, especially for the price.",0
"JeJu Noodle Bar is a must-visit restaurant in New York City. The ramen here is some of the best I've ever had, and the appetizers are also very good. The staff are professional and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. The only downside is that the menu is not too complex, so you know exactly what you're getting. I would definitely recommend making reservations, as the restaurant is quite popular. All in all, a great experience!",1
"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. We just happened across The Smith on a walk through the UWS. The restaurant looked packed compared to his neighbors, so we hoped it would be good and it surely didn't disappoint!I ordered the KALE + QUINOA SALAD. Sounds pretty basic, but believe me and everyone else who posted about it on Yelp - it's DELISH! The dijon vinaigrette dressing is to die for and the salad is topped with toasted almonds, ricotta and sun-dried cranberries. One of the best salads I've ever had. My mom ordered the BUTTERNUT SQUASH SCHNITZEL. Sounded very unique and we really weren't sure what to think of it but WOW. The flavoring was so tasty, The squash is fried then it's topped with a medley of mushrooms and sauerkraut. I'd definitely go back here just for this food; although there were about 10 other things on the menu I was struggling to decide between.",0
I had a great time at Taloache! The service was great and the atmosphere was really cozy. The food was also really good - I had a fish taco and it was really delicious. My husband had the queso fundito and it was really good too. The guacamole was also really fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend Taloache for a delicious Mexican meal.,1
"The Woodlands is a great spot for a intimate meal with friends. The ambiance is warm and inviting, and the waitstaff is attentive and professional. Our apps and entrees arrived promptly and were both delicious. We highly recommend Woodlands for a romantic evening out, or for a casual night with friends.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was great and right in the heart of Rockefeller Center. The prixe fixe option was a great value and I really enjoyed the seafood dishes we ordered. The apps were also good, with the Mediterranean meze being my favorite. My main course was the Loup de Mer and it was cooked very well and very tender. The fruit we had for dessert was also very good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal at a great value.",1
"I love a good food hall, and was excited to finally try Northend. Although it didn't really feel like a food hall since there is only two restaurants and a bar. Nonetheless, the food was great! I highly recommend the Brussel Mac and cheese from Harlem Public. They give a really generous portion and I had a enough for lunch the day after. The hot fried chicken sandwich is also really good.",0
"Seasoned Vegan was everything I wanted it to be. The food was flavorful and fresh. I love the decor as well, there are paintings, vases and other pieces that bring the place together. The one gripe about SV is that there are a lot of soy options but not many options for those trying to avoid soy or who cannot have it. I ordered their raw lasagna which was amazing! I also ordered a side of ""shrimp"" to go with it. I sampled from my companion the Nefertiti salad as well as mac and cheese which were also pretty good, the Nefertiti salad could have had more toppings on it but all in all a great experience.",0
"Rubirosa has consistently been my favorite place to get NY style pizza precovid so this was the first time visiting after what feels like forever and it felt so good to be reunited!+Vodka pizza: This is where it's at. The flavors are so simple yet flavorful and the simplicity of it gets me every time. Just know that Rubirosa gets their pizza ultra thin, to the point that it almost feels like you're eating a thin crispy cracker with sauce and cheese on it. But the fold factor was still there and ultra thin pizza just means more slices to eat! +Roasted octopus: I love when octopus is done right since it can get quite tough when overcooked, but Rubirosa you nailed it again! The roasted octopus was perfectly charred on the outside and the inside was so tender that it felt like a dream. The crispy potatoes and creamy sauce contrasted nicely with the octopus. Definitely a must try! +Mozzarella sticks: What's not to love when it's fried cheese! Plus the cheese pull was perfect and the marinara sauce had a slight kick, which I enjoyed! 5/5+Arugula salad: I first tried this salad years ago and now I always have to order it. The combination of the bite from the arugula, bright acidity of lemon, and savory saltiness from the cheese makes for such a great combination. As of this review, indoor dining requires vaccination proof (vaccine card and ID to match the names). Otherwise you can request outdoor dining but know that outdoor seating is limited!",0
"Came here for birthday dinner.  My reservation was at 6:15pm.  Arrived at 6pm.  Went up to the host, told her I have a reservation at 6:15pm for party of 4.  But she couldn't find my reservation, Lucky I took a screen shot right after I make a reservation and I show it to her.  She went to her I believe either a manager or someone that's higher up.  She look it up and said she don't see my reservation, but my name is in the system.  I don't get that.  But she said she will show me to my table.  I said ok.Anyway, once we sat down, our waitress came and took our order.  For appetizers we order Crispy Calamari, Lump Crab Cakes, Crispy Sweet & Spicy Chicken Wings.  Entree we order, Blackened Scottish Salmon, Grilled 10 Oz. Filet Mignon, Baked Lobster Tail With Crabmeat & Penne Pasta With Jumbo Shrimp.  While we're having our appetizers, I notices there's no bread, but we saw other tables have bread.  So we ask our waitress, and she said oh you want bread?  Shouldn't it comes with as complimentary?  Since I saw every table got bread except us.  Then our entrees came, still no bread.  When we are almost finish our entrees then the bread came. Shouldn't the serve once we order?  Dessert we order Chocolate Mousse Cake & Nutella ice cream with Chantilly and valrhona.  Overall, beside the bread issue that we have to ask for it.  Other than that.  The food is really good.  All the appetizers have good flavors.  Salmon and Losbter is not over cook.  The steak is cook perfectly and really tender..  Overall, I would come back again.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ramen was really good, and I especially enjoyed the flavor of the koku ramen. It was very flavorful and the pork was very tender and juicy. The broth was deceivingly spicy, and it looked like the non-spicy broth but definitely packed a punch. The only thing I didn't like was how they blast pop music so loudly that you can't hear your friends, and I also think it's too hot in the restaurant for ramen. Otherwise, I would definitely go back to try the other ramen options they have.",1
"This restaurant is not appropriate for any kind of social gathering. The man seating us made an incredibly inappropriate comment about not wanting men or husbands joining us, and the drinks are overpriced and the food is not good. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
Everyone knows the Smith is good. It's a staple where I want to get everything on the menu and then I leave a lot poorer than when I came in. This is a great brunch sport or place to take the family when they are in town.,0
"We didn't get food, just sat outside for drinks. They brought the wine to us with an ice bucket which was nice. They have a great outdoor setup, plenty of tables and it's very cute. There are TVs out so it would be a great weekend place to watch sports. The service could have been a little more attentive- we had to wave them down several times and they didn't really check on us but since we just had drinks it wasn't too big of a deal. I'd definitely go back!",0
"Wowzers! Authentic NY Italian establishment!I probably couldn't say enough or eloquently enough to accurately describe my experience here, but I will give it an attempt! My husband and I visited here for his bday with his sister and brother in law. We all shared a bottle of the Argentinian Malbec which was such a good choice! Nice and bold, with a rich semi-dry finish. Dry but not overly dry. Good enough for me to take a picture somewhat as a momento and also as a reminder to try and find this wine at the local total wine!I had the pumpkin tortellini and butternut squash ravioli which was super yummy with a rich but not overly done sauce. I shared this dish with my husband who got the chicken parmesan. The sauce was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of cheese on top! My sister in law got the chicken marsala with mushrooms. She particularly enjoyed the sauce and how it wasn't overly thickened. My brother in law can't remember what he got but I know it was a dish with chicken and potatoes and peppers. I do remember he ate the entire thing and everyone was very happy with the meal and service so... no matter what it was I don't think we could have gone wrong with anything!Service was very prompt and courteous! Desert was the chocolate cake, couldn't pass it up after seeing it wheeled past on the desert cart! The big spiral wheels of ganache over arching the cake were calling our names! I also loved that the chef was walking around chatting. So nice to see a place that's intimate and invested in their patrons. And it was topped off with a bday gift from the chef to go home with, which was a bottle of the marinara sauce! This was such a nice touch!!! Highly recommend this place and will visit again every trip to NY!",0
"A beautiful airy open restaurant in the heart of mid town serves super fresh seafood with white linen cloth service. A nice place for a pre theater lunch - really 3 1/2 stars.  We had a late lunch and although Open Table and Oceana accepted our 3 pm reservation,  the hostess made it a point to tell us the ""Chef made an exception for us."" I thought to myself- why did they open this time to diners, if it was too late for the staff's mid afternoon lunch break which took place two tables away. We had a nice selection of fresh west coast oysters from $4 to $5 each. They were excellent but not Ice cold. The Salmon burger ($24) and Shrimp Salad with pistachios ($29) were tasty, but the chef or line cook  was a little heavy on the salt. The Alagash White draft and the Blue Point Toasted draft we're ice cold, but at $10-$11 at least $2 each overpriced. I asked for a house Cabernet and they served me a BV Cabernet at $25 for a nice 5-6 oz pour. However, not wanting to be a miser here, I checked and this 2016 wine goes for $40 per bottle and I doubt they served me the 2015 BV reserve at $90 retail. I'll be back but will bring my bigger credit card.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was authentic and very filling. I highly recommend the soup dumplings, but you really can't go wrong with any of the menu items. The delivery service is always quick and reliable.",1
"I really enjoyed my experience at Ichiran. The stall and individual dining allowed for more of a focus on the food itself, which made for a really flavorful broth. The noodles were a great texture, firm but chewy, and paired well with the broth. I also enjoyed the chashu which was very tender. Overall, I think this place is a little expensive for what you get but it definitely is a high-quality meal.",1
"I've eaten here plenty of times and the food is mediocre. The frozen drinks are laced with syrup and sugar, yet this place is always busy. Each time I come here, the same people are always here... and they all the know each other. The draw to this place is the diverse customers. Come often enough and you'll find yourself with a new circle of friends. If Cheers or Central Perk was a real place and located in Harlem, it would be this place.",1
"Tried to apply the $20 off for yelp check-in only to be told that it was no longer valid, despite being advertised on their yelp page. Super sleezy and I can only imagine how bad the service would be in the restaurant. Avoid otherwise, be aware, they may try to rip you off.",0
"I absolutely loved this bar! The service was perfect, the environment was amazing and the drinks were all really good. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great night out.",1
"The Tavern by WS is a great place to eat. The service and ambiance are terrific, and the menu is not extensive, but everything is excellent. The salads are worth trying, and the raw bar selections are fresh and well presented. The wine list is extensive and well priced, which is not surprising given WS's status as a wine critic. I highly recommend The Tavern and will be back.",1
"I stopped in at this restaurant for an early date dinner and I must say that the food and service was excellent. They specialize in Greek food, and the seafood options are definitely the highlight. The atmosphere is very chic and the seating is plentiful, so there is no need to worry about being cramped in. We ordered the grilled octopus and lobster pasta and both dishes were fantastic. The octopus was very chewy and flavorful, and the lobster pasta was very satisfying. The only downside was that the lobster was a bit on the sweet side, but that might just be my personal taste. The service was great and they were very attentive, refilling our water glasses frequently. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
"The staff are so, so friendly. Great people, really. The decor is sort of gaudy? It's a bit strange, funky. But I dug it. A little quirky.

Good variety on the menu - a bunch of different pastas, main dishes, and an entire pizza menu on the back. My duck ragu pasta was good, but honestly I couldn't tell you if it was duck or not - that's ragu for you, I suppose.

The dishes were sizable. Minus the Eggplant Parmesan - small, but quite good. A somewhat different take on the dish from what we normally have.

The waiters were all so friendly and attentive. I got very good vibes from this place, but the prices were steep (should come as no surprise, it's right in front of you). I would come back, but only if I'm somehow not feeling ambitious enough to try a new Italian restaurant.",1
"I visited this restaurant on Tuesday night and there was no wait! The restaurant was relatively busy, but it wasn't too loud. The service was nice and attentive. I'm giving this restaurant three stars because the food wasn't as flavorful as it could've been. We asked for super spicy tofu soup and it was pretty mild imo. However, my bean curd soup was really spicy! Maybe they got our orders messed up, but still I felt that the taste or Korean food kick wasn't there. Overall, the service was five star.",1
"I absolutely love this place! I've only ever ordered it off Seamless and it gets delivered so quickly and the best part is how large the portion is. I can easily make this into 3 meals because it comes with rice. There's also an option for the Mughlai special which is perfect if you want to try a few different items it includes 1 appetizer (smaller than if you got it normally), 1 entree (smaller than if you got it normally), rice, naan (massive!), mango chutney & raita (comes in small little plastic containers). I've tried the saag paneer and malai kofta and both have been great, the saag paneer was better though. The malai kofta is definitely very heavy on the cream, but still good on the flavor. I've ordered from this place 3 times already and i've been very happy every single time. This is definitely has become my go-to indian place for delivery!",0
"This place used to be my favorite but I think the service and the quality went down a bit. The artichoke slice while still delicious was served to me cold after being heated up. I think the servers were trying to rush us out of there as quickly as possible because of covid but leaving a slice in the oven for a couple of minutes longer would'nt really change much. Still, the slice was delicious and thick and so large you cannot finish it all on your own!",0
"We came on a Thursday night and the wait wasn't too long. They let you put your number in the system and text you when the table is ready.We were seated at the counter which was quite cozy and gives you a view of the kitchen. Ordered the fried chicken and so ramyun. Fried chicken - chicken wings and drumsticks (5 total) fried in tempura batter which gives it a completely different flavor profile. Interesting dish worth trying once. So ramyun has a veal broth. It's rich and flavorful yet clean and not oily. Delicious cuts of high quality meat. Ramyun was filling even though it looks deceivingly small. For a one Michelin star, they have very affordable options. Hard to say if it's worthy of the 1 Michelin star but dishes are more unique compared to the many Korean restaurants in NYC.",0
"This restaurant is definitely off the beaten path, but if you're looking for some delicious noodles in an unusual location, this is the spot for you. The flavors are nothing special, but the noodles are very textured and delicious. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",1
"Was looking for a place for Indian with outdoor seating and heating uptown and found this place. They have two semi enclosed ""cabins"" with an opening and a heating lamp overhead between them. The server was very accommodating when we switched to the side with more heat and it was warm enough to have dinner with coats on.They have hand sanitizer and the server was wearing a mask. The samosa was excellent and very fresh, tasted like it was made today. The onion (kulcha) nan was also made today with fresh ingredients. And my mango lassi was very good. The chicken tikka Masala had grilled chicken cubes thrown into a just made creamy sauce. The one instance where I prefer it to be simmering for while, but with a pandemic fresh ingredients are de rigeur. With so few options that met our aforementioned criteria, we were lucky to find this place. And also when I mentioned the 5% off for yelp check in, the waiter gave us 10% off this already reasonably priced upper East side restaurant. I asked and the waiter said they are doing a lot of take out and delivery during the pandemic.",0
"It's a bit of a walk away, but I was really excited to try out this spot. Unfortunately, my experience here could have been better. I placed a pick up order for 3:30pm. When I arrived, the first staff member inside told me that the restaurant was closed from 3 to 4pm. I tried to explain that I had already placed the order, and another friendlier staff member came by and told me to wait 10 minutes and my order would be ready. They brought me my burrito, which was huge and came with pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole nicely packed on the side. The burrito itself looked delicious, but when I got home and dug into it, I realized the burrito was not filled with chicken like I had ordered.",0
"Came here for NYC Restaurant Week, they have a 3-course prix fixe for $30. Warning, the restaurant charges a credit card fee of around 3% which you can avoid by paying cash. Unfortunately I did not know about this until the bill came.They have a nice selection of cocktails and wines, all our drinks paired well with the food. Started with the Italian Flag appetizer, which is just tomato and mozzarella in olive oil. Fairly basic dish and the mozzarella is on the harder side.For mains, we had the truffled moneybags which was my favorite dish on the menu. The sauce is incredibly rich and the pasta cooked to perfection. The neopolitan ragu was also a good pasta option, texture wise it is less 'al dente' than some other Italian restaurants and the short rib is very tender.On the dessert menu, the cannellonis were superb although the cheesecake can hold its own as well.",0
"Unfortunately, don't think I'll be returning. Got the spicy tuna roll and it was so mushy and did not taste very fresh. Only redeeming quality was the shrimp tempura I also got, but even that was subpar. Disappointed that the food was not what I expected since this is the second time I've ordered from here.",0
"I decided to stop by at this place for quick lunch. at 12:30pm they were out of half the items like sushi rice, tofu and chipotle dressing. They also didn't have any menus with ingredients listed anywhere. There were uncommunicative people behind the counter tripping over each other. It was my first time there and they only stared at me waiting for me to tell them something and looking at their next order instead of telling me what the options were or what the next step was. Machines would have given better service!",0
"I had heard great things about Sugarfish and I was pleased to find out it wasn't just hype.  Sugarfish delivered on the sushi, the service, the ambience and value.  They include the gratuity in their prices, which we appreciate.  The fish was fresh, simple and good quality.  This is not an Americanized sushi joint.  They do not drown their fish in sauces and crunch so if you're looking for that type of sushi, this isn't it!  I prefer my fish as clean as possible so I can actually taste the fish and Sugarfish doesn't disappoint in this regard.  I ordered TRUST ME $43 Edamame Tuna Sashimi ponzu and chives Albacore Sushi ponzu and chives, 2-pc Salmon Sushi toasted sesame, 2-pc Toro Hand Roll Japanese Yellowtail* Sushi lemon, 2-pc New Zealand Sea Bream* Sushi citrus salt, 1-pc Sea Bass Sushi yuzu ponzu, 1-pc Blue and Dungeness Crab Hand RollI was very happy with what I ordered and thought everything exceeded my expectations.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much for a chain so was pleasantly surprised.Hubs ordered Don't Think. Just Eat. $67 The menu most similar to what Nozawa served his regulars at Studio City's Sushi Nozawa. Typically includes a sashimi course, seven orders of nigiri, and two hand rolls.  This set comes iwth more pieces so certainly the better option if you want more food.  Sugarfish also steps it up a notch with the fish, prep and adding touches to make this set worth the extra money.  Hubs really enjoyed it.The service was friendly and helpful.  The sake we ordered was delicious, not too sweet.  Hubs and I would definitely return in the future.",0
"So pleasantly surprised. A very lovely, intimate space that's perfect for date night. We didn't get the steak, so I was worried about what that would mean. But the wine was good - albeit not amazing, but I should have trusted my gut and gone with the one I was more interested in. The food was excellent though. I'm late on writing this, so not remembering what we got, but they had a fair number of gluten free options and they were all tasty. We liked it so much we got a gift certificate for others to try!",0
"Came here on a Saturday night not knowing that Samwon Garden rebranded into Antoya. Was a HUGE fan of samwon garden before and it was my go to kbbq spot in Ktown.Can attest that portions did get a bit smaller and prices did increase, however I thought the food was still really great!!! Our waitress, Chloe, was very attentive and fantastic. Service was excellent. Egg soufflé was delicious (we normally do no order this!). Meat quality was still amazing! So tender. Meat is not overly fatty (like some kbbq places that just give chunks of fat). Would come back! But I can see what some of the other reviews were talking about (re portions and prices).",0
"Line outside was about twenty minutes. Overheard the staff say that there's always a line starting at 11am on weekends. Luckily, Friday and Saturday they close at 1:30am so it's an option to come here for drunkchies (: I got here around 10pm on a saturday and it was still really busy. The line took about 20 mins just to get into the door to wait in another line. If you're caught in between the first and second door, you might die from overheating. In that one specific section, their heat is turned to max. There's coat hangers directly behind your seat and also a small hook below the table for personal belongings. The water is self serve, order process is really easy. They're doing a promotion right now where the first noodle refill is FREE. Super awesome. I opted for the suggested set, which is ramen with meat, scallion, egg, seaweed, and dashi????? (i think it was dashi) for $24. Our server recommended to order the noodle refill when I'm halfway done with the original portion. They are not skimpy on the noodle refill at all, if anything I felt like the refill was more generous than the initial bowl! The downside is that there is no soup refill, so don't inhale your soup until you make it to the refill LOL Since this is a no-tip establishment, only extras on the bill is the tax. The entire meal from start to finish was great, I actually can't find one thing to complain about. I'll definitely be coming back!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was excellent and the service was great. The only downside was that it was quite busy and we had to wait a bit for a table, but it was definitely worth the wait. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I really enjoyed my visits to this restaurant! The dim sum was great both times I ate there, and I loved the variety of carts available to choose from. The service was also great, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was top-notch and the food was delicious. I love tapas style restaurants, so this was perfect for me. I ordered the popcorn chicken, pork dumplings, roasted vegetables and tiger roll and everything was fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"Beyond Sushi is a decent vegetarian restaurant and the service is attentive. The water refills were frequent and the food was pretty good. The only downside was that the shishito peppers were not very flavorful. The price was a bit high, but I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I have mixed feelings about this place.  We came for a celebratory lunch and decided on the AYCE BBQ... (not worth it) - don't expect Ktown KBBQ, you will surely be disappointed by 1000%. Barn Joo took over, what I think was the old ""Heartland Brewery""... the decor is nice and spacious with 2 floors.  Relatively empty for lunch hour... and we found out why.  The service... what service?!? Took forever to get water, refill, sparkling water, extra ban-chans, Kim Chi, scallion mix, extra meat... so basically everything.   Our waiter was sooooo absent, at one point we got up and grabbed a new bottle of water ourselves. The food is decent, we liked the spicy wings and fried dumplings. For AYCE, we ordered: Ribeye, Pork Belly and Kalbi patty (1st round), ribeye & pork belly is ok, not the best quality of meat.. but the kalbi patty was like eating a regular hamburger. It was gross.  2nd round, ribeye, shrimp and bulgogi.  Do Not Get the Bulgogi!! What's a sloppy mess of destroyed beef. It was not visually appealing. The shrimp was dry (as expected). 3rd round, ribeye, pork belly and pork shoulder. Honestly, by the time we got our meat refill, we were 90% full because we sat and waited like 20 mins in-between rounds.  Because our waiter is absentminded, didn't give a shit or perhaps that's their ""AYCE strategy"" - make you full with air.  For AYCE - order Ribeye & pork belly. Decent. I think we might give it another try but probably just the a-la-cart menu. Really iffy by this experience but perhaps it will be different for regular dining.",0
"Walked in with a few friends on a Friday night - which I don't recommend by the way, because they get pretty busy. No alcohol still unfortunately. I ordered the chicken tikka - it was pretty stingy on the chicken considering the price.. I think there were three small pieces in mine and all the rest was bell pepper. The flavor was good but I would have liked a little more protein. The naan was pretty dry and brittle and also has egg in it in case you have an egg allergy. Overall, it was fine but I didn't feel this was a place worth going out of my way for and you kinda have to considering the location. I will stick to my regular Indian haunts.",0
This is a quick burger place that is around my work place. I order here for company lunch before and it was pretty decent. This place is very small. There are only 6 bar stools here for dining in. There are also only 2 staffs. I can see this place being very pack during lunch hours. I came after lunch hour so there wasn't really a lot of people but still has to wait at least 15 mins for a cheese burger with no buns. I think this is a pricer alternative to five guys. However their weekly specials is what's worth it. Their weekly specials is a burger with fries and drink for 10$. Their curly fries are really good. I like their chicken Tuesday or chipotle Thursday. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if I get lunch here it would be front the weekly specials.,0
"I recently visited Sticky's Finger Joint and I really enjoyed my experience. The food was fresh and delicious, and the service was great. I especially enjoyed the variety of sauces that were included with my order. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
I really enjoyed my meal at this ramen shop! The chashu was more on the thin and non-fatty side and the meat was cooked perfectly. Their broth tasted very traditional when it came to a Tokyo style ramen. They also have great spicy veggie options for your vegetarian friends which I really appreciate! The appetizer portion- the vegan buns were just fried vegetables in the bun which I thought were not that special for me and they also ran out of the croquettes which was a little disappointing. Their cucumber salad is more on the lighter and sweet side with touch of vinegar. I definitely would just order the ramen as it made the whole meal. It's a super small shop and it gets very packed easily so you'll have to stand outside to wait your turn. Their kitchen is really small and you see everything they make and it really looks like home cooking. The price is expensive especially if you're looking for a great ambiance but I would definitely keep coming for a casual meal. I would expect more of a more Authentic Japanese ramen shop experience rather than a fancy place.,1
"The food was good, but the service could have been better. I would recommend this spot to others, but only if they're willing to walk a bit.",1
"I was so excited to finally get the chance to eat here! Big fan of Forest & Bubba! This particular restaurant in Times Sq. Is two levels. You walk in to the gift shop and a hostess is waiting at steps that lead up to the dining area.Tons of memorabilia from the movie all over the walls. The VIEW I mean wow! There is not one place you sit and have a bad view!Cleanliness 0 I was seated at a table that had not been wiped down at all. With Covid times this is very gross and disappointing. I understand simple mistake, and these were kidsssss (very young adults)  in here working, so I didn't expect much. The second table I was seated at was great, but again greasy stain on seat so I had to wait to get that wiped down as well. Terrible water stains on silverware.Shrimp 10 Whatever sauce they put on this shrimp WOW! Of course the shrimp did not disappoint one bit. This was the highlight for sure. The salmon overdone bland. It looked very sad on my plate. The drinks were very good. I had two mules the flavors were perfect.Jeff 5 starsAlthough I'm not happy with the restaurant as a whole, our service was great. Jeff was nice fast and attentive. It was a busy Friday night and I understand this area is high in tourist. He knew the menu very well. Anything we asked about he knew it like the back of his hand.Overall, I'm happy I can say I went now. We got to keep our glass and tin cup. I will be back but definitely not this location,respectfully. There's a cool one at Universal City Walk I'll try next in Orlando!",0
"I wasn't impressed with the service here - it took quite a while for them to come back around and take our order, and then it took even longer for them to bring us our food. The beet kofta was actually pretty good, but the butter chicken was a bit dry and not very tender. The rice was also a bit of a surprise - I didn't realize it was an additional charge, and it ended up costing me a bit more than I would have wanted to spend.",1
"I have heard good things about Hillstone but after my first visit, I am not blown away. The restaurant is very nice and the service is good. The food was so so. We had:- Spinach Artichoke Dip - very good but not unique- Veggie Burger - didn't care for this at all. It was sloppy, falling apart and had some sort of sweet sauce on it.Due to its convenient location, I will probably come back and if my experience is better, I will update this review.",0
"I had a good experience at this restaurant. The lines were manageable, and the food was good. I was especially impressed with the baked whole cauliflower dish - it was delicious. The only downside is that the food is a bit expensive, and the portions are small. But overall, it's a good place to eat. I gave it three stars.",1
UND is a great addition to the neighborhood! They recently started serving lunch and the menu options all look delicious! I ordered the Caprese sandwich with Prosciutto which was excellent. I would definitely order it again. They have a good outdoor seating setup in addition to their indoor dining. UND is the perfect spot to enjoy lunch outside on a beautiful day. Highly recommend checking out UND for lunch.,1
"We had a nice relaxing weekend brunch, with Dave having an omelette, and I the Calamari which was excellent and plentiful. Our waiter was attentive and helpful and I was able to order non brunch items (no eggs for me) which took a bit longer but the amount of calamari rings was impressive . Not sure why others rated so low but it was reasonable, fresh, and tasty.",0
Up Thai is a great place to eat in NYC. The food is delicious and the service is top-notch. I especially appreciate the attention to detail that the restaurant gives its employees. Prices are definitely reasonable for the quality of food you receive. I would definitely recommend Up Thai to anyone looking for a great Thai meal.,1
"Got takeout. Overall, food was decent. Lots of options for the baby because nothing was too salty, spicy, or greasy. Got the mushroom tofu soup, mild, which was quite good as a soup. Barely spicy. Slightly bland when paired with rice, but I'm not complaining because it's perfect for my baby. The croaker fish is really good, which comes as a complementary side dish. The japchae noodles were a little clumpy and dry - not as good as other places. Wished the seafood pancake came with some sort of sauce. The galbi was okay, tough in some areas.",0
"I absolutely love Cho Dang Gol Korean Restaurant! The food is always delicious and the ingredients are of high quality. I've never had a bad experience here, and the side dishes/banchans are always a hit. I especially love their seafood tofu soup and the jjambong tofu stew.

This time I came to CDG for dinner and got the jjambong tofu stew, which is a hearty spicy stew with loads of mussels, clams, and octopus, bites of pork, vegetables, tofu, and glass noodles. The seafood-based broth is souper (hehe) flavorful that is packed with umami and spice. There was a good amount of seafood and it tasted relatively fresh with no unpleasant fishy flavor. Overall, this stew was warm and comforting -- perfect for a cold day or if you're just craving wholesome and comforting food.

The other main star of the meal was no other than the many complimentary banchans :) Usually when I go, they have the kabocha salad, a mashed kabocha salad that is sweet but smooth in texture, similar to potato salad, spinach seasoned with sesame oil and garlic, and their house made Napa cabbage kimchi,",1
"I stopped by this restaurant because it's the only one around the statue. The burgers are a bit overpriced, but they're the only option. The pastrami is pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend the chicken tenders. The side salad is just ok - you're better off getting one of those refrigerated salads by the sodas if you want salad. Overall, I'd recommend this place, but just be aware that the prices are a bit high.",1
"The Thai restaurant I would like to come back regular basis. I loved loved loved uncle boon's crab fried rice and Laab with fried chicken. Laab salad was perfect with the balance of mints, green, crunchy fried chicken :)

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious Thai cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food is absolutely delicious.",1
"I read great reviews for this spot, sadly it was just okay for me.Place:- Standing room only, no seats.  It was Thursday 7pm when I went, and I managed to find a spot to eat. But very crowded, and had to squeeze pass ppl to get anywhere. - The line moved very quickly.  Food and service very quick.Food:- Cactus taco - just alright. If you never had cactus before, give it a try- Steak taco - I thought this was the best one.- Carnita taco - very greasy/oily... - chicken taco - it seemed over cooked for me. charred.- Horchata - not cinnamon-y.... disappointed.You can add salsa to your taco - there is an assortment on the side.",0
"Ordered: Chicken Tikka Masala, butter chicken, samosas, and dessert. Everything was pretty tasty. Just the right amount of spice.",0
"The Gochujang is a decent place to order food through Seamless, but I wasn't impressed with the food itself. The fried dumplings, fried vegetables and bulgogi kimbap were all stale and not very fresh. The bulgogi meat in the kimbap was also very crumbly and not very fresh. I'd recommend trying something else than The Gochujang when looking for Korean food in Ktown.",1
"Stopped by on Saturday morning to get some quick bites before walking around the city.  We got the roasted pork puff, chicken puff, pork and cabbage bun, and a red bean pastry. It's self service - you fill a platter with the things you want and bring it to the counter to pay. Easy, no frills.I recommend everything except the pork and cabbage bun - only bc it doesn't have that much filling. Everything else was so delicious! I also got a hot coffee that came with milk and sugar which I wasn't expecting and not how I usually take my coffee but it honestly hit the spot. We ate everything in a small park on the next block and it was such a good way to start off the day.Everything we got came out to about $10 in total.",0
"I really enjoy La Vela restaurant. It's close to my job, so I stop by on my way home a lot. The pasta and clam dish is my favorite thing on the menu, but I only give it three stars because it is a bit overpriced. I spend about $50 on a glass of wine, one entree, and a tip, and that's without any dessert or apps included. If I didn't enjoy their one entree so much, I probably wouldn't go back.",1
The chicken noodle soup was amazing - with chunks of tender white meat and firm noodles. We'd pass on the organic white bean soup as it was more of a purée than a soup. The atmosphere was cozy and the staff was friendly. We'll definitely be back!,1
"Awesome service. Good food. Great prices. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about all of the dishes, so they are very helpful in making recommendations. There was good variety on the menu, and the pick 2 for $16 is quite reasonable. The portions are a bit tiny so for 2 people at lunch, we ended up ordering 6 dishes total (3 of the pick 2s), but the total was still pretty reasonable given the area. I think the curry here is the star here, so be sure to get one of the curry dishes. Definitely also get the calamari and the short ribs. Both were delicious.",0
"I had a wonderful experience at Precovid this place had my favorite carbonara in the city. The service was unacceptably slow, however, and it took a little over an hour for us to get our entrees and it was just the two of us. Terrible experience. Can't justify giving a better review if the food took this long, especially if they had a 90 minute table time limit.",1
"Overall, Lokal was a bit disappointing. The dips were delicious, but the rest of our dishes were not as good. The gambas (sautéed shrimp) were over cooked and bland. The grilled octopus was a very tiny amount of actual octopus over a salad. Neither were worth the price at all. The avocado and tomato salad was okay but a little bland. The service was great at the beginning, but we never were offered more drinks and had to ask for the check after sitting for more than 10 minutes after they cleared our plates.",1
"I had a lovely dinner at this restaurant before seeing a show. Our server was so personable, the espresso martini was yum, and the shareables were all great. Highly recommend!",1
"I had wanted to try this spot as it is in the nabe, and we are looking to try Thai places, a break from Chinatown. We were not disappointed. I ordered to go. The hostess helped me decide what to order according to allergy concerns. She took my order, rang me up contactless, and asked if I would like a glass of water as I waited. She was great and greeted me with warmth as her smile came through her face mask. I took my order to go, and the Phat Thai we had with chicken looked deceivingly simple, but was delicious. I understand this place comes from the folks that brought us Uncle Boon's Sister. There is much more space in this establishment. I will be back to try some other dishes.",0
"We really enjoyed our dinner here, have passed this place many times and always seemed busy - glad we  finally tried it!!  So many Thai restaurants in this neighborhood, yet hard to find one we really like!Spice is indicated on the menu by a symbol that means ""mild spicy.""  I like spicy, husband not, so we shared papaya salad but asked for it to not be mild spicy, and they obliged.  It was fresh and crisp and delicious.  I asked for my eggplant/tofu dish to be more spiced than mild, and the waiter wrote that down, but it was barely spicy at all.  Next time I will be more insistent!  My husband was very pleased,  though, that his Lovely Nest, on the menu as mild spicy, came out as he asked for it, not spicy at all.   Tiny place (hey, it's in Hell's Kitchen, every place is small!), but comfortable seating and good acoustics even when packed.  It was obvious on that Saturday night  that they do a brisk takeout business as well!",0
"I had a great time at Uva! The food was delicious and I would love to come back here again when I visit NYC again! The staff was so friendly and accommodating, and I loved the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. The only downside was that the wine selection wasn't particularly great, but that's to be expected in a city like New York. All in all, I would definitely recommend Uva to anyone looking for a great Italian dining experience!",1
"I found this restaurant to be unauthentic and not worth my time. The soup dumplings were good, but the meatball was bland and not up to par with what I'm used to. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"4.5 stars rounding up to 5 because for the $60 price point, this omakase is a steal! This was my first omakase experience since the pandemic, and while not the most traditional and authentic, it did not disappoint! There wasn't a single piece I did not like. Everything tasted delicious and the presentation was on point. Additional brownie points for the friendly chefs working the counter.Highly recommend reservations because this place gets SUPER packed! Also a lot smaller venue than pictures portray. Come here to get your sushi fix, but don't expect Michelin level sushi. You get what you pay for!",0
"This is for Governor's Island. We got the rice platter, which you actually don't need to get rice (you get to choose 2 sides). We opted for jerk chicken + green salad + steamed cabbage, and got white sauce on top of everything. The chicken was good and tender, and the cabbage was nicely seasoned - think I may have enjoyed it even more than the chicken. It came to about ~$17 I think, so that's the knock to 4 stars, but the stands on the island probably all have some price inflation.",0
"I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a intimate dining experience. The service was quick, but not overly friendly. The food was good, but I would like to try the daily specials. The only downside is that the restaurant is cash only.",1
"I had my birthday dinner here. Although they don't do anything special for birthdays, I enjoyed myself. They have a wide variety of food that my partner and I could pick and choose from to suit our tastes. All-in-all, it was also fairly priced and filling!I recommend the Yelp waitlist for sure. This place is alllllways busy and crowded.The standout dish... KIMCHI CREAM UDON. I read some reviews and had high expectations, which meant I went in cautiously. Prepared to be somewhat let down. But it was better than I expected! Not mild or toned-down from the cream at all. LOTS of that spicy kimchi flavor I love. Great choice! Would come back for it.Also, the ribs were tender and the sauce was addictive. Great stuff.The tofu and avocado was good to start the meal off with: light and refreshing, but otherwise not stand-out. The roll was a summer special, I believe it has eel, avocado, and tempura. Although those are three of my favorite things, it was just okay. I guess it didn't stand out compared to the other dishes.Thanks for an enjoyable meal",0
"I would not recommend the 2nd Avenue Deli based on the high prices and poor food. The sandwich prices are outrageous - $25 for a small sandwich - and the quality of the food is not great. We went without doing any research on yelp or even looking at the menu, but I would not recommend this restaurant based on the prices.",1
"I was really excited to try out this Japanese-Peruvian place after seeing it was listened as a Michelin chef's recommendation on a Youtube video. Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with the dishes we ordered. My favorite dish was the tofu dish, the sauce that it came with was creamy and paired well with the different textures of the tofu and shrimp (the crispy rice added a nice touch). The tonkatsu was pretty lackluster, the pork was not very crispy and the dipping sauce was also not anything special. The cucumbers were extremely sour. The udon verde was the only redeeming part of this dish, I liked the creaminess of the pesto. The fried rice was alright, I enjoyed the pieces of octopus but didn't think that there was much crab flavor. The dish came with a lot of greens, which was nice, and the egg on top added a nice touch. Overall, I think I expected more from this place. Their indoor area is beautiful though (a mixture of different textures with pothos hanging from the ceiling), and the ceramic plates and cups they use are a nice touch.",1
"Overall, Bluebird London was a decent restaurant with attentive staff and good desserts. However, we found the food to be too sweet for our taste and the lounge area to be quite quiet on a Sunday afternoon.",1
"I've been to Pianos as a patron and as a musician, both upstairs and downstairs. I've seen it busy, and not so much and have been here on almost every day of the week. Its a solid music venue, wish the DJ was not so loud downstairs, but generally a good vibe, nice stages and always cool bartenders. Last night when I used my drink ticket, the wine bottle ran out walf way through the glass so they poured me a whole new glass in addition to my half glass. Very unexpected but they treat musicians nicely. I'll update for sure when I try the food eventually.",0
"I was there for restaurant week just before going to see a play. I knew I had a tight schedule but the staff there was very understanding and and accommodating. The decor is really beautiful. The food was unlike anything I've experienced before and I am looking forward to returning. Blue Fin is located in the heart of Times Square, so it is easily accessible no matter where in the five boroughs you live.",0
"I recently visited the Chinese Divvy Ramen Shop in Midtown and was really impressed! The food was delicious and the prices were moderate. I especially loved the coconut curry broth and thought the pricing was fair. The service was good and the restaurant could use some sprucing up--it's a bit dated. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"This review is solely on the bar service. It was like a normal night out and we were heading to a bar. We walked passed by the place with really nice decor. You know what happened next. We walked in to this bar instead. Drinks were $18. I asked for recommendation and got one of the sweeter/fruitier drinks. Guess what...it wasn't that sweet. The champagne they used was bitter for my taste. But the guys enjoyed their wiskey based cocktail. This place also had live piano on a Tuesday night. I can definitely see how this place can be a good date spot. Overall, this place provided a nice atmosphere.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant had decent views, good service, and decent appetizers. However, the air conditioning was not working well and it was very hot inside. I also thought the section size was a bit small.",1
"This is an average Vietnamese restaurant in my opinion. We ordered the beef over vermicelli noodles, pork chop over rice, summer rolls, and a Vietnamese iced coffee. I was disappointed by the summer rolls because it seemed like it had been sitting out for a bit before it was served to us as they were tough to chew. While the pork chop was very flavorful, it was thin and a bit on the dry side. My friend who enjoyed the beef dish said it was very flavorful and the spring rolls on top were a good addition too. The Vietnamese ice coffee on the other hand was 5/5, very refreshing.",0
"I visited Sarabeth's Signature Sirloin Burger located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan and overall had a decent time. The space is large, airy and simply pleasant to be in. The menu looked delicious and great offering on paper. Unfortunately, I was too hungry to go for a good looking dish so I decided to go for something that I thought it would be safe and filling. I went for SARABETH'S SIGNITURE SIRLOIN BURGER. It consisted of aged cheddar, pickled green tomatoes, bacon, jalapeño marmalade, sautéed onions, and house cut French fries. I ordered medium rare. It disappointed me. I had better burger in 3rd Avenue by a bar and by other hole in the wall places. I regretted my decision.

I left the place quite hangry. The price of the burger was quite pricey: $24 where other places that would offer better quality would have been around $16. Its quite pricey at Sarabeth! The drinks in here was alright. I am normally not a drinker so I wouldn't know if drinks are better or worse than other places. I ordered a Sangria and it tasted alright. The service in this place is quite",1
"It was my birthday and my friend reserved a very chic and upscale reservation at this beautiful establishment.  They obey all of the city's ordinances on Covid one must show their vaccine card and ID or the vaccine via the NYC app and ID.  The place is simply gorgeous that night they were playing 80 R&B and the music was so refreshing and easygoing.  The other patrons were well dressed and the wait staff was extremely pleasant and professional.  We ordered several appetizers, tuna tartare, ceviche and the famous truffle fries.  Not one of them disappointed.  For dinner I had the sea bass with steamed bok choy drizzled with a crunchy topping.  Just simply delish.  Drinks were Moët and their well known watermelon libation.  Would absolutely go back no hesitation.  Thank you for making my bday even more special.",0
"We were told by staff that  this is the only Somali restaurant in NYC.  The trek out to Harlem was well worth it.  The atmosphere here is fine and casual.  There's no table service so you order via your phone which was a bit frustrating for a resurgent this small, but the food here was really good and unique.  The veg options are good but somewhat similar.  The Roti wrap is great and the yogurt contrasts the mango pickle well. The vegetables in  mango sauce similar flavor to veggies in roti but still very good.  The Mango juice was very fresh.   This is a great restaurant for a casual bite and something unique while up in the neighborhood.",0
The Smith is also located across the street from the Lincoln Center. I took my daughter to see the play the great society for her 21st birthday and after the play we decided to go for dessert and drinks. We could not have picked a more fun and great place. Our waiter was exceptionally friendly and helpful. They serve very creative craft cocktails. The dessert menu was excellent and each dessert that we had was very tasty and creatively prepared and presented beautifully. There are a lot of nooks and crannies in The Smith And I should suggest that you go exploring. If you see a peep hole - I encourage you to look through it!,0
"Most authentic tacos in NYC! This place was awesome. I knew immediately that the food would be good as soon as I saw the plastic drink tubs with the ladle by the window!We got 3 tacos: chicken, steak, and pork - all great! I have a bias towards chicken, so I definitely enjoyed those extra extra! It all tasted very fresh and the guac was a pleasant surprise to me. The price was higher than I am used to in my hometown for tacos, however, it was reasonable for NYC prices.It sure is true - NYC is the melting pot of different cultures and THE spot for good food! Will be going back to try the other locations as well, but this one was great! The only minus I have is that it could have been a little more clean on the inside. There was hand sanitizer around of course and masks required, but I wish that the tables were a bit more clean and such, considering the recent NYC covid outbreak!",0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The soup dumplings were mediocre at best, and the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were especially disappointing. The skin was incredibly thick and the soup dumplings were huge - not very well-made at all. The staff was efficient, but I didn't enjoy my time here at all. I would recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for a good meal.",1
This place is so great! I had the steak pho and spring rolls. Everything was so yummy and filling. The spring rolls were the crispiest I've ever had and the pho was really flavorful. The ambience is really casual and the staff were really friendly. My only complaint would be that it's a little pricey. I paid about $22 for my meal + tax and tip. Nevertheless I will come back! Their banh mi looks amazing.,0
"My dad and I stopped here for a quick lunch while walked around Rockerfeller Center because I had been wanting to try it for a while. I was very pleased with what I got! We walked in to order and had to wait quite a while for our food to be ready but once we got it it was very good. I ordered the Guac Burger and was very impressed. I'm not vegan or vegetarian so I am not very experienced in the veggie burger arena, but I was impressed with this one. Since the patty was made of sweet potato, the spicy sauce complimented the sweetness of the patty well. My dad and I shared the brussel sprouts and they were also pretty good and cooked nicely. Overall a pretty nice lunch option.",0
"La Pizza & La Pasta is a great place to go during restaurant week! They had a great selection of items on the menu, and everything came out quickly. The pasta was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but it was still enough for one person. The pizza was delicious, and I was able to split it with my husband. The only downside was that the regular a la carte menu wasn't as good as the restaurant week menu.",1
"This review is for the bar, as we've been here a couple times only for drinks.It is located in the Westin Times Square, and I was hoping it would be a gem, and not your typical ""hotel bar.""  Well, it *is* NYC, so the decor and ambience was a touch classier and sleeker than just another hotel bar, and definitely more lively.  But at the end of the day, although not a bad place, I wouldn't go out of the way to make this my destination.The literal bar itself is small, maybe 5-6 seats, but the rest of the place is a nice lounge space.  We sat at the bar both times we've been.  Bartenders are nice and attentive.  But they only had one beer on tap (some oktoberfest) despite the 6 or so they had listed on the menu, which was disappointing.  The bartender steered me to the Bronx Pale Ale in a can instead, and that wasn't bad.  Bar nuts were served, we didn't bother ordering any of the food on the menu.  Convenience and location a plus, as we were staying at the Westin.  There's a $30 ""destination fee"" credit you can use here, which is fine.  Staff is fine.  But this place wouldn't be my primary destination in a night in NYC.  Plenty of other bars in the area.",0
"I always enjoy a meal at Sushi-Ko. The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly and reliable. The atmosphere is always fun and the menu features a variety of interesting and unique Japanese dishes. I've taken my mom, friends, big groups, and small groups here, and everyone has had a great time. The music is always good and the seasonal menu items are always tasty. I would definitely recommend making a reservation so that you can enjoy a meal with a group. Sushi-Ko is always busy, so it's a great place to go for a night out.",1
"Couldn't decide on what to eat on a Sunday night. Was originally looking for a restaurant in Hell's Kitchen/Times Square, but ended up returning to FiDi where my hotel is. I recall one of my work colleagues had mentioned that The Malt House offers a free drink when you present your work I.D. But stopping by after a 90 minute massage, having an alcoholic beverage wasn't on the top of my priorities. Rather, I needed to fill my starving stomach with dinner and head to LaLa land lol.When I arrived, I asked the bartender if the kitchen was still open. He replied ""If you know exactly what you want, it sure is."" I quickly skimmed the menu and decided on Tavern Wings as a starter and Scottish Salmon as my entree. Surprisingly my food both came out at the same time, nice and hot, delicious and hit the spot. I was very impressed with presentation and how the food is displayed, almost as close to how pictures were online. Had to wash it down with a nice glass of ice water. Something about the filtered water in Manhattan, it's very refreshing and doesn't have the hard chlorine taste you'd normally find in large US cities lol. Once I was done, I needed to rinse off my sticky fingers. Restrooms were on the same floor, but the wash room shares with both woman and men.I'd definitely come back again, perhaps an early HH or a night cap with some friends next time. It's super convenient to the hotel which I stay on work trips. I really like whatever playlist/Pandora they had it on, lots of familiar 90's and 00's hits.",0
"There are so many Felice restaurants in NY it can be considered a mini chain. I hadn't heard much about them before dining here, and it makes sense now that I've had a taste of their middling, traditional Italian fare served in neighborhoods like Columbus Circle, the Upper East Side, and the West Village. Places that serve plates of caprese salads and $27 bowls of pasta will attract crowds, as long as they don't completely mess up the food, and the Felice restaurants have that formula down to a science.The arancini we started with was an easy hit, with a crispy outer layer and flavorful interior of mozzarella, tomato, and rice. We followed that with a quinoa salad, Spaghetti alla Carbonara, and Fusilli Al Ferretto E Burrata. I was more excited for the fusilli because of the burrata, but the burrata portion was light and the San Marzano sauce a little flat. The carbonara had more flavor and the pasta had more bite to it, making it a more satisfying dish overall.The cocktails were more impressive than the food-- between the Aperol Spritz and Espresso martini I had both a nice buzz and caffeinated high for a long while after this meal. Anyone sensitive to caffeine be warned-- I had a hard time falling asleep after just one of these. We finished our meal with some gelati-- one scoop of pistachio and another of hazelnut. For a place that bills itself as a casual restaurant, the prices were more in line with a higher end, special occasion restaurant than it would a place you'd pop into for a casual weeknight meal, and for my money I'd go somewhere more special.",0
"3.5 starsI came here with my bf and his sister to have an early bday celebration for himAfter seeing the rave reviews, we were excited. The morning of, everything went wrong leading us to be about 15-20 min late for our rsvp. We are normally never late for omakase rsvp since some charge a late fee. We called over an hour before telling them we'd be a little late so I'm glad we didn't get any added late fees! One thing that felt a little.. patronizing was when we got there the waitress started clapping. Which at first I was confused but just smiled and laughed the awkwardness away, since we were late and that was on us. We apologized to them and literally everyone in the restaurant since I though they all had to sit and wait for us. But it looked like everyone was already eating except two other ladies - they probably had to wait for us, sorry!! This already put me in a weird moodOnce the sushi started coming out, I noticed how small the pieces were. Given the price tag, I kind of understood though. It was a good meal but definitely not filing at all! They also give free ""happy water"" which was a nice touch. We told them it was my bfs birthday and they sang happy birthday and have him a little pile of sashimi over rice which was nice and super appreciated.The whole clapping thing threw me off, maybe I was taking it too personally but I didn't like it and seemed aggressive. When she came to show us the ""special"" add ons on the iPad, she also just stood there waiting for us to decide, super pressuring! I'd like to look at it myself without being stared down the whole time. Again, seemed aggressive. Overall the food was ok but I don't think I'll be coming back here",0
"I visited Seamores for dinner with my wife and we both had a great time. The atmosphere is very elegant and bright, perfect for a spring or summer date. The fresh haddock was cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious. I would highly recommend the Reel Deal to anyone coming here.",1
"We had dinner reservations in China town and were a bit early, so we asked the sweet hostess at Il Cortile, that was super efficient if we could just grab a glass of wine and an appetizer while we wait. She was so accommodating and very personable. She said no problem and got us set up with waters and bread and a QR code for the menu. We just were buying some time before our dinner reservations, and our waiter was so cool and let us just order some clams oreganto and a couple glasses of wine. We weren't there long, but I got a good vibe from this place. Staff definitely was on point with keeping the restaurant flowing and keeping the customers happy. I would love  to come back again  and have a proper dinner. I will definitely come back.",0
"Definitely insta pic worthy! I came here with my fiancé for our anniversary, She loves pink so I figured I take her to an all pink restaurant. The Resturant have an outside dinning area but I didn't like it since it did not give me the pink ambiance I wanted. The restaurant is really REALLY small,  there's one host and one bartender, both of them were so nice and attentive. Reservations must be made in order to dine however since they use a 3rd party to make reservations it isn't easy and it had a issue saving my card to schedule my dinner. ( Also there's a $35 cancellation fee that's applied to your card if RSVP-canceled )They don't have a lot of option for food, but what we order was good. My fiancée had the salmon with roasted vegetables. I had the ""PINK AS FUCK"" pancakes with one egg ( I asked can my pancakes be flat, they told me that they come as is... so I think it's pre made and they just warm them up) and my egg literally had the oil on top, it was so grassy. We order 2 pink drinks both for $15 each Overall our bill came up to $90, this was just an experience to feel cute, but the food option and the price definitely make this restaurant a cute place for drinks only.",0
"The restaurant's lighting is absolutely amazing, and it definitely gives the place a cozy atmosphere. The service is friendly and helpful, and the food was definitely tasty. My favorite dish was the mango lassi, and the chicken Tikka masala was also very good. The only downside is that the bathroom is quite small, but overall it's an enjoyable restaurant to visit.",1
"Arrived without a reservation, but was lucky to be able to grab a table in the bar area.Ordered the Pan con Tomate (grilled bread rubbed with tomato, garlic and olive oil), Gambas de Ajillo (shrimp, garlic, brandy, and pepper in olive oil), Gambas de Palamos (grilled red prawns springled with salt), Croquetas Cremosas (creamy croquetas), Judias Verdes con Romesco (crispy tempura green beans).Everything tasted fresh and was seasoned very well!  Some of the best tapas I've eaten!The restaurant is lively and the bartenders know what they're doing; the drinks were well made.Staff did a great job of checking in and making sure everything was good.If you love tapas, I highly recommend you check this place out!",0
"This restaurant is a must-try for anyone visiting China town. The food is simple but delicious, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. I recommend ordering the pork and duck - both dishes are memorable and delicious. The wait time can be a bit long, but it's well worth it. I would also recommend trying this restaurant out in the park - the setting is so peaceful and the food is great.",1
"Delicious!!!!! Spectacular service!!!!! Can't wait to come back!!!! The guajillo sauce served with the taquitos is amazing! Tuna crudo also delicious, love the spice from the serrano and the lil guac served with it. The homemade chips and tortillas are FIRE! Tamale was yum, fish taco was probably in my top 3 fish tacos ever, and the birria ughhhh that lamb with the guajillo consommé so much flavor! Had that guey and this guey and both were great, also tasted the gringito and the no manches. All the drinks had substantial alcohol, we got pretty buzzed just for 2 cocktails each. Wanna try everything on the menu!! Ambience is amazing look forward to our next visit.",0
"The atmosphere was great - very spacious and relaxing. We ordered our food promptly and everything tasted fresh and delicious. Prices are definitely reasonable, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. The best part is that they offer BYOB, which is perfect for large groups.",1
"Not impressed with the food here. I miss pizza beach. The deep dish square pizza is good however ours had pesto and so drenched in oil the bread was soggy. My salad was inedible and sooo spicy (spinach salad although I ordered Kale) No where on the menu does it say spicy, and trust me I like spicy. The ceasar salad had whole anchovy, gross, and barely any dressing. After asking the waitress if it had anchovy she said in the dressing. Then when I commented and no one ate it she didn't remove it from our bill. However, waffle fries were delicious. I would reccomend changing the descriptions on the menu as what you expect to get so that one isnt confused when the plate arrives. Food wasn't good, service terrible so much so that I won't go back!   Ps: stop responding with ""hope you visit us again"" and change things. its evident this place has to work on staffing, service, and flavor, all of which an apology won't fix.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The interior is really nice, and the service was great. I especially enjoyed the appetizers, which were both delicious. My favorite dish was the pad krapow, which was cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"New favourite Pizza place! We come to NYC once a year and try a new place each time, and this has definitely topped our others before (OPs, Pauly G's, Lucali). Not only do you get the amazing pizza, the people working there are very nice, that's rare for pizza joints in New York. The crust was very crispy and bread nice and fluffy, generous amount of spicy pepperoni, A++ !",0
"I thought the food was decent at this restaurant. The portions were small, but the prices were reasonable. The atmosphere was really homey and I liked that about it. I would definitely come back here for a casual meal.",1
"Overall, the food was decent, but I was disappointed that we had to wait for a full party to be seated when the restaurant had a few open tables. I would have given them 4 stars, but because of this policy, I downgraded it by one star.",1
I ordered the Black Tan Tan Ramen ($20). I was a bit shocked by the portion size as it was tiny. Taste was not bad. Only thing I am super curious about is the portion size when viewing other people's pictures. I have eaten at karrakata and like it a lot better. The portion size there felt more fair as well as the taste was more stronger. Interesting because I read that they were owned by the same owner so mega shocked about the inconsistency in taste and portion size.,0
"I recently attended La Grande Boucherie's Yelp Elite Event, and I have to say, it was a fantastic experience! I worried that the hosts might scoff at me when I came to redeem my meal or have me wait off to the side, but my experience was the complete opposite. They treated me like a respected guest and even invited me to sit at one of the tables while I waited for my food. My meal took less than 15 minutes to come out. In that time, I got to admire the beautiful space the restaurant is in. I loved how the tables were separated by glass dividers. The small tables made me feel like I was dining al fresco at a cafe in France.

After my short commute home, I was happy to find that my food was still fresh and warm. The fries were nice and crispy and came with ketchup and Mayo. The steak was tender and medium-well just like I asked for. The herb butter was heavenly.

Overall, I had an amazing experience at La Grande Boucherie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",1
Camellia is amazing! The food is really good and the service is super friendly. I love their rainbow noodles and pork belly baos. Their gelato is also delicious! I would definitely recommend coming here to try the food.,1
"Chelsea Square Restaurant was great! They had a lot of space and were able to take us in right away. The pancakes were my favorite part, and the hot chocolate came very close. The omelet was huge, and I would caution anyone who is going by themselves to be careful with portions - it's definitely all-you-can-eat. The service was great, and I even lost my phone for a few seconds and they stopped everything to help us find it. The price was also good, so I would definitely add Chelsea Square Restaurant to my list of places to come back to when visiting the city.",1
"in need of a smooth Thai Iced tea? look no further than Terra Thai on a quiet block of Alphabet City. Terra Thai is a tiny kitchen that serves up some familiar eats from Thailand (like Pad Thai, Pad Si Ew, Drunken Noodles and some rice dishes). there's no indoor seating as this place is super small. it's a nice casual decor.  the restaurant primarily does takeout and delivery. the Thai iced tea? tasty, sweet, and a great antidote for the summer sweats. it's basically an icy cold dessert in liquid caffeinated form. cost? $4ish + tax + tipstaff are friendly and fast. if you're strolling around the ABCs, this is a easy stop for a treat and caffeine boost before walking around some more. drops mic cuz it's Thai-mi outzzz",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at Dian Kitchen. The beef noodle soup was especially good - it was very tender and had a great flavor. The chicken was also very good - it was a mini portion, but it was mouthwatering nonetheless. I also really enjoyed the street potato - it had a great flavor. The only downside of my meal was the wonton in chili oil - it was not very good. The skin was very thick and the stuffing had no taste. Fortunately, their homemade spicy sauce was spicy and really good. Overall, I would definitely recommend Dian Kitchen to others.",1
I'm trying to venture out more in the neighborhood and try new places. I had passed Makiiny many times prior to the pandemic and decided to come here when I was craving Thai food one day. I ordered tofu pad Thai and Green curry.This was one of the most bland and tasteless Thai meals I had in recent memory. There was nothing memorable about my meal. I regretted not going to Som Tum Der instead. I won't return.,0
"'m a sucker for Xi'an Famous Foods. I previous reviewed the restaurant in Flushing, which is the original one so I was excited to try the Midtown location. This restaurant is very close to the Empire State Building and gets a lot of foot traffic from tourists so I was a little weary that the quality of the food would go down. To my surprise, it didn't! I came here on a Sunday night around 7/8pm with a couple of friends (3). One of my friends order the Spicy Beef Noodles while my other friend and I both ordered the Spicy Lamb Noodle Soup. We were able to grab some of the last lamb dishes before they sold out! When we got there around 8pm, most of their cold vegetable dishes were already sold out such as their spicy cucumber salad, which is a shame because that would be perfect as a side for the noodle soup. I would suggest if you have specific dishes you want to eat, to go here early. They also have slightly different items based on the restaurant location- so I wouldn't be surprised if your favorite side dish isn't at this one/or vice versa.The Spicy Lamb Noodle Soup was delicious. Great flavor that wasn't washed out with the soup. Great cumin seasoning on the lamb and the noodles were great. I prefer the noodle dish on a cold winter day- it will really warm you up.The place is pretty small and you seat yourself. With that being said, a lot of people do take out so there is a lot of foot traffic so be sure to check the back. I can see this place getting a little hectic during lunch hour if people are trying to sit down and eat. I would suggest no more than 4 people groups when coming here for a sit down. Great location and will be sure to come back for more. It's a bit closer to Flushing so this is a great spot to eat Xi'an Famous Noodles.",0
"I visited Hou Yi with my wife around 4:00 PM on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy. We ordered half mild beef spicy hot and half herb with pork soup. We also ordered various items such as pork belly, cabbage, fish tofu, etc. Everything tasted good, but I did have a few complaints.

The first issue was that we were one of four groups to be seated. It was difficult to get someone to come to our table to order more items, and when the third round of food was brought out, the waiter brought the check without asking. We didn't even realize that he had brought the check until after he had left.

Another issue was that the plates that were brought out didn't include everything we asked for. We ended up having to ask for everything again.

All in all, the experience was not very good. I hope the other location is better.",1
"With the future ban on foie gras, I came here to gett he original db Burger.  It is a Sirloin Burger filled with Braised Short Ribs,Foie Gras, and Black Truffle. It comes with a Parmesan bun and fries.I came for lunch on Saturday and it was relatively empty and had pretty good service.  Despite getting the burger, I was also presented with a starter of bread and butter, which was decently good too.I rarely spend $35 on lunch, especially for a burger, but I thought this was good and worth it if you wanted to try something unique, and soon to be banned.",0
"I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. The waitress spilled food all over my coat and purse and was extremely rude about it. Additionally, my dry cleaning bill was not reimbursed which was disappointing. The beer selection was good, but I've found better selections elsewhere.",1
"I visited Mercury Bar while in New York on vacation and it was a great find! The bar has a lot of TVs for sports events, so you can watch your favorite team while you eat. The seating is quick and the drinks are strong, so you can enjoy yourself without feeling too drunk. The food was decent, and the prices are reasonable. It's located a few blocks from Times Square, so it's a great spot if you're looking for a night out in the city.",1
"I visited Governor's Island for dinner and I really enjoyed the food. I got the rice platter and it came with jerk chicken and green salad. The chicken was really good and tender, and the green salad was also very good. I also really enjoyed the white sauce that was on top of the food. The rice platter came to about $17, which is a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it because the food was really good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"What an absolutely disappointment. Popped in for breakfast before returning home And I wish I didnt. It's a small spot with lots of charm and the wait staff is truly accommodating but other than that, i dont see what the hype is about. I had the steak & eggs and my wife had the chics (I think). Mine Was served sandwich style (unexpected but ok) and it was SO bland and too spicy. I love some heat to my food but it needs to be flavorful, not just spicy. Absolutely no character. The wife's food was no better. Chicken flavorless but cooked well. Biscuit was... odd and again no flavor just heat. The only thing that was slightly enjoyable was the truffle hash browns but WAY too much pepper. $53 wasted - Def will not be back",0
"We popped in for dinner the other night and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table but it was worth it. We started with pork buns - because they are irresistible, let's face it. These were huge and puffy and served one at time. There was a good amount of filling. You can custom mix your noodle soup with 5 or 6 different noodle options. I got thin rice noodles with chicken broth, triple mushrooms, mixed vegetables and pan friend meat dumplings. The dumplings were the most flavorful part of the soup I got. I added hot sauce and soy sauce and concluded I must have ordered the wrong broth. There just wasn't much flavor. The ingredients were good, but I wasn't wowed. I tried a bit of my friend's Chinese dish that was quite good. I'd try something else, or order from the menu specials next time instead of venturing.",0
"The Cecil is a great place for a night out with friends. The food is amazing, and the staff are super friendly and welcoming. The DJ made it all the more special though, with a great playlist and vibes. The outdoor seats were real comfortable, and the dibi with fried plantains and rice might be the star of the show.",1
"The hype must have died down because I ate at Chloe peacefully.Been couple of years since I've had Chloe in Soho, the original location. Food was delicious but eating there was just so crazy, felt like a mad house inside looking for a place to sit that I haven't had it ever since. We got a light meal and just shared their famous quinoa salad with their lemonade.  The quinoa salad was refreshing and addictive as I remembered and the lemonade was very unique and refreshingly good! It wasn't your typical lemonade and had minty cucumber flavor that we wanted to order more of it. Compared to the Soho location, this place had more open space and not sure if it was early for dinner, but pretty empty that we loved it.  This place is perfect for everyone with little coloring books and crayons to entertain the kids and healthy meal options for the family, as well as instagrammable food for the younger generation.The only thing I would say they would need to improve is keeping the tables clean and having our food come out faster.",0
"Overall, I thought the brunch at Soho Park was pretty good. The service was a bit slow at first, but once our reservation was fixed things went smoothly. The atmosphere was cute and the food was typical brunch fare - lobster mac and cheese being my favorite dish. The punch was a bit strong, but that didn't bother us too much. The DJ played a good mix of different music, which was perfect for getting everyone singing and having a good time. The only downside was that the waitstaff seemed a bit attitudey at times, which made the experience less enjoyable. All in all, I'd recommend Soho Park for a brunch date.",1
"Has a great lunch at Avra Madison on a late Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant was busy the customer flow was well managed.For the starter, we all had the Salmon Tartar which we all enjoyed and for the main course we had the Lavraki (Branzino) and Lamb Chops which were both great.  The Lamb Chops (which were recommended by our friendly and personable server Nick) were done perfectly and worth the supplemental charge.The chocolate cheesecake and the orange cake provided a nice finish to the meal.Definitely expect to be back!",0
"Have walked by this place for years and it took me almost 10 years to finally stop and enjoy some dinner here. I was very surprised by the food and drinks they were great. Their burritos and meals and entrées offered big plates for around an average price of $20 20. The best part was the beer Margeritas A frozen glass with margarita and an upside down corona the perfect drink. A little steep around $15 each, although definitely worth the price. I had two and although I don't have any photos to surprise the quality I would definitely recommend you check this place out the ambience is good the food is great and the service was good and it wasn't too crowded so you could hear yourself talk, we met for dinner around 730 and when we left at nine the place was almost empty, I would definitely be back the place was clean they had a cool bar the facilities were clean and restaurant overall I think the ambience outdid did my expectations.",0
"In the age of the fast casual restaurant boom, you're spoiled for choice if you want a nicely cooked protein with two veggie sides. Mint Kitchen doesn't deviate from this format-- you've seen these menu items before. It was the prices that gave me pause. To spend $18+ for a bowl at a fast casual eatery would suggest large portions, maybe some interesting ingredients. Instead I was left barely sated, with a sad, piddly pile of spinach to accompany my piece of salmon. The salmon itself was nicely prepared, though it was billed as ""falafel crusted"" and had a tiny crumble of falafel on it. Tasty enough, and high quality, but I really can't justify the portions or price when there are many other options in the area. It definitely could've used some kind of hot sauce, which is not an option here.The decor inside is cozy and pretty, with lots of hanging plants and stadium seating replete with back cushions and pillows. I'd rather lounge here with a cup of coffee than splurge on a meal.",0
"I visited the new restaurant called Cutting Board, and I have to say that I was not impressed. The food was not available yet, so I could not try any of the items on the menu. However, from what I could see, the concept seemed to be very similar to hotpot - you are given a boiling soup base and a side of rice noodles, and you are free to add whatever you like. Unfortunately, the soup base was not very flavourful and I did not leave feeling very satisfied. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I visited this restaurant for a quick bite and am overall disappointed. Most of their dishes are quite basic and the veggie ramen is particularly bare. Additionally, they put iceberg lettuce in both the ramen and the bento, which I found interesting. The ramen and the veggie sides on the pork belly bento were the only things I found noteworthy - the pork belly was really good and tasted great with rice. The sides were unfortunately quite lacklustre, with just iceberg lettuce and then two pieces of broccoli with what I assume was oyster sauce. The skin on the pork belly was also very chewy, which was interesting since I'm much more used to a softer and more tender skin. Overall, I think this restaurant is good for a quick bite of Chinese food, but may be happier trying something else in the area.",1
"I had a really bad experience at this restaurant. My steak was raw and it was really uncooked, so it was really tough. I don't even know how to begin to describe how terrible my experience was. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I really hope Moonrise Izakaya (along with every other restaurant/cafe/bar) pulls through this horrible time. Not to be pedantic but even with dining-in no longer an option, every little bit (through ordering delivery, tipping generously, and buying gift certificates) counts. I'm particularly horrified on behalf of the newer restaurants that just opened their doors and now have to deal with this. There's really nothing quite like Moonrise in the UWS, where the dining landscape seems, for the most part, quite safe and homogenous. I guarantee you are not going to be bored with the Sailor Moon decor. (Any chance the name is based on the brilliantly weird Wes Anderson film, Moonrise Kingdom?)Came here with a few friends and were immediately offered a free shot of sake. Yes, indeed, I will take that trip back to college!The menu is more or less Japanese pub food which, in my book, is multiples better than American bar grub. Don't skip the cheesy skillet corn, which is as much fun to eat as it looks, but eat it fast before the cheese cools and congeals. I liked their unconventional take on ma po tofu that's super saucy and just begging to be spooned over rice. The one thing we ordered that I wasn't a fan of was the pork buns - the slice of pork was both a little too fatty and hard to chew. Didn't order the chicken kara-age but almost every other table did. One more thing - the avocado bomb was a really fun dish to split with a group. Came with a very generous helping of spicy tuna. Definitely a more unique place to eat, drink, and be merry on the UWS. Would love to come back and soak up the atmosphere once things get less crazy but in the meantime, I'm definitely ordering delivery.",0
"My mom has been wanting to travel to Greece since forever, but since thats not happening anytime soon, I thought I'd give her the next best option! It was my first time coming to this location, but like the other Souvlaki Grs, this one had a tight space and a white, blue theme. We didn't make reservations prior which was stupid of us because we came here on Mother's Day. It was raining and cold out, so we were shivering waiting by the door, but thankfully there was a mini heater by our feet. They asked us to wait for a free table but on second thought, they gave us one of the reserved tables because they didn't want us to wait for who knows how long. It was super sweet and considerate of them. We were a bit worried about the food coming out slow because we were on a time crunch. But the food literally all came out within 15 minutes. We got the pastitsio ($18), moussakas ($19), loukoumades ($9), and a wrap. Both the moussaka and pastitsio were bomb but huge - had to take then to go. The loukoumades looked so good that the table next to us couldn't stop staring and eventually ordered it too! But the little balls of dough were really filling. They were handing out red roses to moms on the way out. And the guy handed one to me and my sister too - mind you, we look way too young to be moms, so his coworker was telling him that he didn't need to hand it to us. We just handed the roses back lol it was hilarious.",0
"I was so excited to try this restaurant when I heard it was open during COVID times! The food was amazing and it was great to have a local restaurant to go to during this time. I got the westlake soup, Shanghai style noodles, green beans, and sliced beef and tripe in chili oil. Everything was really good! The Shanghai style noodles were my favorite. They had a great quality noodles and the flavor was great. The sliced beef and triple in chili oil was also really good. It was just the right amount of spicy for me. The Xiao long bao were also really good. They had a good flavor and they were really big. The pork pan fried buns were also good. They had a good flavor and they were really crispy. The pork and sticky rice siu mai were also good. They had a good flavor and they were really sticky. I can't wait to try more of their menu items!",1
"The food was overall okay. The service was confusing and communication was lacking. I stumbled upon this place when my friends and I were on a search for lunch and saw there were seats available. We each ordered a bowl of noodles and a bunch of appetizers. My bowl of spicy ramen was tasty and mildly spicy. The popcorn chicken was a bit bland but crispy. The fried chicken was better. Cold cucumbers were refreshing. Overall, a decent lunch.",0
"I love this spot! The food is delicious and the ambiance is perfect. I love the tropical theme that they have going on. I came here on a Friday after work at around 6ish with some friends and it was actually a bit crowded. The bar stools were all taken and so were all of the tables. You sit yourself down and it's first come first serve. After waiting around and ordering drinks (their happy hour is amazing and it's until 7pm. I highly recommend their frozen margaritas) the table with the beach chairs opened up and my friends and I grabbed it right away. Tables started opening up later on in the night, so don't leave if you don't find one at first! Give it about 10-15 minutes. When you order they give you a cute bottle to put on the table so the waiters can find you. We shared guac and chips (love that you can customize toppings on the guac) and I had the chicken tacos which were so good. The service here is actually great and I love that the waiters kept checking on us to make sure we were okay and got everything we ordered. I think this will be my new favorite after work spot in midtown!",1
"Eaten here once and rest of the time just did take out... this is located outside of the Chinatown area...very convenient location right off the F train station on East Broadway. Depending on which exit you get off off the closest one - if heading uptown (take the front car, head up the escalator, through the turnstyle and the stairs to the left will take you right outside). If coming downtown, take the back of the train...The local buses are close as well - M9 leaves you across the street and M22 one 1 block away on Madison Street.   Hours have changed since the pandemic so they don't open as early anymore...they open more so around 10am or 11am. There is outdoor seating -- you can see when you come out of the train station...they put it up over the summer and now have it enclosed for the winter with heating lamps.  Staff is friendly and food is ok. Many of the dishes that I have had dining in were more westernized than the traditional.   They have smaller subset of dim sum dishes, and serve lunch and dinner as well. Plenty of dishes to choose from...For take out, the roast pig is good, soy sauce chicken is hit or miss. Beef chow fun has gotten pricey and bit oily.  Everyone has different tastes so will leave it up to you to decide for yourself.  Restrooms inside are located downstairs and for customers only.",0
"I really don't like leaving one star reviews, but so many 'not so great things' happened I felt I should.1.  We entered Salls at 11:10, to be rudely told they were not open until 11:30.  That's funny because online and on your front door it clearly states 11:00am opening time!2. The male employee was clearly put out that we had a larger group, he was very stand offish towards us and barely made eye contact when we were trying to find out where we should sit.3.  Quite a few of us ordered steak and eggs with the bottomless mimosas- I'm not sure why they asked how we wanted our eggs, because we were all served 'well done' on all aspects!  My steak was very small and thin, eggs resembled hockey pucks!  At $35 a plate, most of us sent our food back!  It took forever to get all the plates out.  My second steak was literally served to me raw, I'm not exaggerating as you will see in the picture.  I sent that back, and at least the outside of it looked like it touched a hot surface when it was returned to me!  It was still pretty extra rare on the inside and not what I asked for!  Eggs were better second time around.  Many of our group complained that the food was not cooked appropriately once they received it.4.  You have 90 minutes to drink the mimosas.  I think it took 90 minutes to get the drinks.  First one was pretty heavy on the orange juice, second one was better.To sum it up, the food was a huge let down and the service was disorganized at the best of times! I really wanted this place to be better than the other online reviews- sadly not!  I would not bother trying this place to be honest!",0
"I personally don't understand the hype of this place. We waited in line for about 20 minutes or so and ordered two plain and one pepperoni square slices. I think it'd be some good drunk food, like greasy pizza always is, but if you're just looking for some great slices, Prince Street failed to impress. There was way too much sauce and it was quite salty. The pepperoni was a bit better, but I wouldn't come back to wait in line for it.Edit: What a response from the owner a minute after I posted my review lol.",0
"I came to this restaurant with a couple of friends after a show at Carnegie Hall. It has a bit of a neighborhood bar feel. Not quite a dive bar, but definitely no frills or fuss. Their cocktail menu didn't have any signature drinks, just the classics. I loved the boldness of listing the long island iced tea as the first item on the menu. I had a glass of the house wine. They were very heavy with the pour which was much appreciated. My friend got the house sparkling wine and it was also a generous pour. I didn't eat but my friends had the sliders and chipotle ranch chicken sandwich and enjoyed them. Our waitress was not super attentive, but service was fast. Nothing really special here but nothing to fault either. It's conveniently located near the NQR so it's a decent option if you're in the neighborhood.",1
"Jacob's Pickles is a great place to go for a good time. It was consistently busy throughout the night and when we showed up I was expecting at least a 20 min wait but it was only 10 minutes. You can order full menu at the bar so we sat there. Our server was Jess and she was one of the best servers we've ever had. Cool chick who was ready to let us know everything about the place and the menu items. We ended up getting 4 different kinds of pickles which were the dill green beans, sour green tomatoes, big dill kosher cukes, and the jalapenos. I have to say I was looking forward to these the most but they weren't the best parts of the meal. The dilly green beans seemed overpowered by vinegar, the jalapenos were overly soft and little pepper flavor, and the kosher cukes were good but pretty much the same as the store brand. The sour tomatoes were the most decent out of all of them, pretty well balanced.

Our entrees were the thigh basket and the nashville  hot chicken biscuit  sandwich. The thighs were giant and had a good crust.  I didn't think the nashville chicken was",1
Wasn't what I was hoping for when craving Thai food. Everything here was just basic no wow factor of any of the dishes I had here. The edamame was actually my first time trying from anywhere and that I won't fault them for because I don't believe I would've liked soy bean pods anywhere. The spicy basil fried rice I had I chose the option of vegetables and it was so greasy and no real strong flavor besides oil and some cut up vegetables with egg. The other dish we also had not pictured was the chicken on a stick from the appetizer menu forgot what it was called but that was actually the best dish out of all. The chicken had penetrating flavors with grill marks that tasted of a light grill taste and the sauces that accompanied were also nice pairing. The shrimp rolls were just ok the sweet chili sauce tasted store bought but it wasn't not edible either so that was ok. So far really things were just ok here but not a I would love to come back here and invite others. Staff was friendly and quick with delivery service but the food was just meh for me.,0
"I stepped into the elegant, stylish Japanese pseudo-speakeasy with high expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. The cocktails were excellent, incorporating their Japanese whiskies well. The ramen was unusual, actually. There's a strong fish component to their Kyoto Ramen broth, and if you're adventurous in terms of ramen you might like it. The noodles and fix-ins (egg, bamboo, pork belly) are standard.

The truffle egg sandwich was buttery. The bread was pretty good too: pillowy, sweet. Service was pleasant but clearly overwhelmed. I'll give them a pass for growing pains.",1
"Happy weekend my fellow Adventurers! We stopped by here as a place before zerospace (its directly across from them) to grab some beers and grub. What this place lacks in really oily, softly fried calamari, the make up with stouts and porters! I enjoyed the service and the place we sat, though they could use a little more lighting in the corner since we had to use our phones to read the menu. The have a decent array of beers, alcoholic beverages, and overall menu. We smelled the ribs from the table next to us and were drooling. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive, we just weren't happy about the calamari. Either way I'd stop in here again to see if we can find something we liked.",0
"This was our first time back since before COVID and the overall experience was very solid.  The seating is spacious and comfortable with the booths and tables already nicely distanced.  Our server was friendly and helpful, as well, making sure to check in from time-to-time.  They also now offer sparkling or still water (complimentary) which was a nice plus.The brunch menu did have a few changes, primarily the addition of a Monkey Bread and crepes, and the removal of the Brioche French Toast and pasta options.  1. I will note that the biscuits and gravy now come with a side of eggs which made me very happy - the price is still less than $17 but now you get 3 eggs (cooked to-order) and the biscuits how have a chive-based seasoning, which I actually prefer.  This would still be my go-to order here.  The sausage is pretty well-done and just a TAD dry but the gravy is still sublime (yes there is sausage in it as well!).2. We also tried the French Dip, which was very solid and came with a side of perfectly crispy fries.  The portion is very generous so it will easily feed 2 if you get an app or another side.    3. The monkey bread was okay - basically a large cinnamon roll comprised of pull-apart rolls and a icing glaze.  We saved ours for ""dessert""!Really glad to see this restaurant get back on its feet and we will be back.  It has become a go-to for my friend and I when we have our get-togethers!",0
"Motorino has a delicious Neopolitan style pizza that is perfect for anyone looking for a delicious and rich pizza. The pizza arrived quickly and still had to be reheated in the oven, but it was so delicious I didn't mind. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great pizza.",1
"The arepas at the Turnstyle market are average, but the variety of fillings makes it more appealing. Personally, I found the arepa a bit dry and the texture different from what I am used to. It was enjoyable, but not something I would get again when I return to the market. I would probably try a different vendor next time. But for about $10 or so it could be a decent deal for a quick lunch.",1
"Valerie is a post-Broadway show tradition for me --- phenomenal drinks, excellent food, and a convenient location for the post-theater crowd. I've stopped by on multiple occasions at this point, and I have never been disappointed. It definitely gets crowded, so I'd recommend a reservation, especially on the weekends. We were able to walk-in around 10 PM on a recent Tuesday and be seated without issue, but the restaurant was quite busy and service was a bit slow as a result. Valerie is predominantly a gin bar, but their extensive cocktail menu features a variety of different liquors, so there's certainly something for everyone regardless of whether they like gin. Their menu lists the ingredients in each cocktail along with 2-3 adjectives to describe the overall flavor, which I found helpful as I sometimes struggle to envision how the flavors come together, especially with more unique ingredients. I landed on the Remember When, essentially a gin sour with a touch of floral, and I loved it enough to order a second drink. My fiance was feeling the fall vibes and ordered the Rather Proper (basically a Pimms Cup with a fall twist featuring apple and cardamom) and the Fabled Leaves (a whiskey drink with pumpkin, cinnamon, and a bit of heat) and we loved both of them, though I'd give Fabled Leaves the edge between the two. I'm always impressed with the food at Valerie, too. This time, we ordered Tempura Green Beans and the Portobello flatbread. Both portions were huge and more than enough food for the two of us to share. The tempura green beans were perfectly crispy, just salty enough, and served with the perfect sriracha aioli to add a little kick. The flatbread was super cheesy and nicely balanced with pesto and what I assume was a balsamic drizzle. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back on my next NYC trip!",0
"Food 3.5/5.0Service 3.5/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 3.5/5.0 Overall 3.5/5.0Nice outdoor dining setup with good partitioning between tables.  Food was generally pretty good, including my go-to chicken parm (not sure if that's considered basic).  Would come back",0
"Solid 3.5-4. I got the house special beef soup and it's good, albeit a bit expensive for the area. I was impressed by how much meat they give you. I think I was hoping for a bit more flavor overall and more chew to the noodles. Seating is limited and they accept cards.",0
"Their Nutella bombolone is to die for!! It was soft, fresh, and simply amazing. Along with that I tried their pizza, which wasn't near as good. It was pretty basic, and I definitely expected better. However, I'm excited to try out their piadas and pasta, as they seem to be traditional and authentic italian. This hole in the wall Italian deli style restaurant is a good spot to try it if you're in the area! - Navya J@nyconthetable",0
"The Upper East Side is a great place to get food to go - the space inside is small, so I can't imagine what it will look like post-pandemic, and the outdoor seating area was set up too, which was really nice. I had the Tapsilog [$13.50], which was straight up money. It was satisfying and comfort food at its best - I say this as someone who is not Filipino but as someone who is familiar with comfort food. The marinated beef was crispy and flavorful, the rice was fragrant with garlic, and the mix of it all was delightful. The tomatoes and vinegar, served in a container on the side, brought it all together with a hit of acidity. Maybe because I was there in the late morning, around 11:30AM, it only took approximately 10-15 minutes to get my food from the time that I ordered. Surprisingly, even after I schlepped it all the way back to Brooklyn, close to 30 minutes later, it was still kind of warm and the eggs, slightly runny. Imagine if I ate it as soon as I got it. The portion size to cost seemed fair to me. I look forward to trying other things on the menu when I",1
Happy to have Joe and Pat's here in Manhattan now.  I ised to go to the original location year's ago on S.I. after a round of golf. This is a super chill spot on the LES.  The pizza is terrific.   Thin crispy crust with some chew to it too.  Sauce is bright with a nice tang.,0
"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with AquaMarina, and I have to say that the entire process was terrible. The person on the phone was making up his own prices and trying to charge me an arm and a leg for everything I was ordering, when I was looking at the prices online. However, I have ordered food from here several times after this, and it has been nothing less than amazing! The food is always delicious, and the service has always been great. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food and top-notch service.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The fruit refreshers are really good and not too sweet. They're even better with lychee jelly. They also make martabak, an Indonesian dessert pancake, but that is currently not available. They said they are not sure when the martabaks woukd return. I would love to come back to try them when they are available again.",1
Got their sushi to go and everything was amazing - great fresh fish and unique pairings.,0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food looked interesting and the service was great. They were really friendly and helpful and allowed me to get started with my meal before everyone else arrived. The only downside was that it was a bit noisy in the restaurant, but that's to be expected in a busy area. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1

"I had a great time at this bar! The atmosphere is casual and lively, and the deals are unbeatable. They regularly have trivia and happy hour specials, and the burger is really good for $5. The only downside is that the nachos can sometimes come out cold and soggy, but overall I've had good experiences here. I definitely recommend checking it out!",1
"Fine. A step about the 2 slices and a coke for $3. The sauce is what it is all about and this is fine if a bit sweet for my taste. In a city like NY were there are pizza places on those corners not occupied by a Chinese restaurant, this is fine. It is close by when I dont want to walk to my favorite over near Rockefeller Center on 48th.",0
"Great service, and delicious food. Just wish that:1. The online menu was updated; and2. They made more of the new food. You know when you get your tastebuds ready? Went here because we wanted to try something on the online menu, only to find out it hadn't been updated. Then we sat w the new menus and got excited to try the mushroom lasagna, and both ordered it, only to find out they ran out - at 730pm :( I get during the pandemic places don't want to make food that will go to waste, but perhaps tell guests before they sit w the menu what's not available? It's low on veggie / pescatarian options, so the Chef was nice enough to make something, which was delicious. Maybe add more vegan, vegetarian and pescatarian options too? I'll come back to try the mushroom lasagna because it sounded delicious!",0
"I loved everything about this restaurant! The food was delicious and hearty - great for sharing and big groups. They had a live band when I went on a Tuesday night, and the ambiance was fun and lively despite the rainy NYC weather. My favorites:- Mac and Greens: absolutely phenomenal. Do not leave without ordering this masterpiece. A perfect combination of cheese and garbs with a dash of green to minimize the guilt. It's a side but you can have it as a meal IMO.- Impossible Chicken Nuggets -- tasted like the real thing, you would never know it wasn't meat! But the cauliflower mac and cheese was a no from me dog...though the server was super nice about it and took the part off the bill, so no complaints here.- The salmon over bulgar was tangy and had just the right amount of spice.- The corn bread: this was HEAVENLY. Buttery and soft, it felt like a warm hug.",0
"I wanted to like this place, but it just missed the mark for me.I was feeling adventurous (lazy) and wanted something fun to snack on and thought I'd give this place a try on seamless.I ordered the make your own combo and got a variety of 5 sticks, plus I had ordered an additional special stick that was suppose to have Gouda.I didn't receive one of the sticks, and upon (late) arrival, all of the food had gone cold and wasn't very appealing or appetizing. I also wish they had more dipping options, I believe they only had marinara and ranch. I'm giving them a 3 as I genuinely like the idea of this spot and appreciate the variety of moz sticks they offer. I just wish I had a better ordering experience.Oh! And the owner(?) texted me thanking me for my order and let me know all of their employees were those laid off from COVID, that was a nice touch. Though I also thought it was unique to get a follow up text.3/5",0
"Ho Foods had high hopes for their food, but unfortunately the food didn't meet those expectations. The noodles were overly salty and the appetizers were disappointing. The service was great, but the food overall was not worth the price. The Lou ro rice was the best part of the meal.",1
"The reviews for this place are average but I wanted to try for myself. I feel I've had better arepas elsewhere though the variety of fillings this place offers could be what makes it more appealing. Personally, I felt the arepa was a bit dry and the texture a bit different from what I am used to. It was enjoyable but not something I'd get again when I return to the Turnstyle market. I'd probably try a different vendor next time. But for about $10 or so I could understand it being a decent deal for a quick lunch.",0
Great location! It is around the corner from Macy's and a block from Madison Square Garden. They have outdoor seating with partitions. You have your choice of high tables or regular table seating.The service was great.The burger was made perfectly to the order.Salad was delicious!,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was really good and I loved the fusion flavors. The only downside was that it was a bit difficult to get a reservation, but it's definitely worth it. The drinks are a bit expensive, but they're definitely worth it. My favorite dish was the roti canai. It was so good, I definitely recommend it to anyone. My fiancé loved his dish too, saying it was the best he'd ever had at a restaurant. The beef redang was also really good, and the table favorite. The only downside was that the chicken in the Haianese chicken wasn't very good. It didn't have much meat on it and the flavor was really lacking. The rice was also ok, but it didn't work well with the chicken. The soup was really good though, and that's the only thing that saved it. Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to anyone.",1
"I had a great experience at Blue Fin Restaurant Week! The staff was very accommodating and the decor was beautiful. The food was unlike anything I've experienced before and I am looking forward to returning. Blue Fin is located in the heart of Times Square, so it is easily accessible no matter where in the five boroughs you live.",1
I came to this restaurant expecting some standard bar food and was pretty disappointed. Our waitress was great and the ambience of the place is very fun and divey. I got the chicken sandwich which had good reviews but mine was just super dry and half of it was just fried batter. This is definitely more of a club dinner vibe so if you are looking for just true bar food go elsewhere. The drinks however are fun and I'm sure for a different sort of activity this spot is great (like brunch or just group drinks and apps) but again my experience with a FOOD was just blah. Also be aware that if you show up before 830 for dinner the spot is going to be completely empty!,1
"Latin music, good, and mojitos! Excellent piece of Cuba in the heart of time square. Loved it. Great service.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good but the guacamole was pretty lackluster. The decor upstairs wasn't my cup of tea (it felt a little corporate) but the food was worth it. I'd recommend this restaurant for a casual night out with friends.",1
"I absolutely love LuAnne's restaurant! The food is always delicious and the service is wonderful. Yesterday was my fourth time visiting and it just keeps getting better and better. We had a pot of jasmine green tea, which was the perfect temperature and stayed hot throughout our meal. We started with the fried dumplings and wontons (which had a vegan cheddar that I was unsure of at first, but, together with the spinach made for the perfect wonton!) I think they must put something addictive in the soy sauce because it's unlike any other I've ever had. So good! We licked our appetizer plates clean then out came the main attraction. Call us creatures of habit but we ordered the same dishes we've gotten the other three times- Pad Thai and General Tsoys. Heaven. On. Earth. I'm not one to eat everything on my plate, but there's never any leftovers after a trip to LuAnne's. We've yet to be disappointed and I can't wait to return!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant based on the great reviews and unfortunately didn't have the best experience. The food wasn't bad, but I didn't love it. The highlight of my meal was the red curry with beef, which was really spicy and delicious. The downside was that the portions were small and I could have done with a bit more protein in each dish. The other dishes I ordered were okay, but nothing to write home about. I thought the bathroom was really nice, and the service was good. Overall, I would give this restaurant a 7/10, but I'm open to trying it again in the future.",1
Solid food.  Happy hour is good.  The uni donburi is solid for lunch. Service is pretty solid too.  Been here three times with no complaints.,0
"I had a reservation through Resy and was excited to try this place after seeing all the hype online. Unfortunately, my experience was not as great as I had hoped. The presentation was definitely Instagram-worthy - they wrapped the nori with plastic so you have to be careful not to break the pieces - but the taste was unfortunately bland. For example, the unagi was dry, the cucumber with the sauce barely tasted like anything, and the seabass just tasted like gochujang sauce. The portion was also very small and not filling (at least not for me and my boyfriend). We ended up eating ramen and dessert after our lunch here. The service was good even though we were seated outdoors in the cold, but be aware that the outdoor seating in the winter is still pretty cold.",1
"Came here for MLK day with a party of eight and didn't have the best experience with the hostess. When telling her how big my party was she seemed annoyed and assured me it would be a long wait. They were busy but not ridiculous. She initially didn't even give me a time estimate until I asked. I was told 45 mins to an hour. Regardless of the wait I gave my information and was told I would receive a text. 15 mins later I received a text message that stated I had 15 minutes to return to the restaurant or I'd lose my spot. Luckily, I bc was close my grabbing drinks and was able to return on time despite the inaccurate indication of wait time. Our waiter definitely made up for our questionable experience with the hostess. He was super personable, funny, and made excellent recommendations. The food was good. Probably wouldn't come back here though.",0
"During the cold snap I made way way to Thukpa for the first time.Seems like a Tibetan twist on ramen, so don't go expecting a Japanese restaurant.They have a very affordable and filling lunch special with a good amount of choices (vegetarian, vegan, mostly noodle soups).I chose the Dan curry noodles cause I was looking for a spicy pick me up. My head was clear by the time I finished. Delicious!The ambiance is modest. Tables are closely packed. But not a problem when the food is this good at a nice price.I saw they have Tibetan momo (dumplings) on the menu, so I'll be back to try those.",0
"I found Niche to be a great spot for a catch up with a friend. The restaurant is small but cozy and the service is impeccable. The only downside is that the menu is quite limited, so it's difficult to order something you're not familiar with. The food is delicious and comes with a great deal of flavor. I would definitely recommend Niche to anyone in the area.",1
"I had a generally negative experience at this restaurant. The pasta was overpriced and the drink was watered down, which made the overall meal not very enjoyable. The ambiance was nice, but in comparison to other nicer restaurants I've been to, I didn't think this one was worth the price tag.",1
We went for brunch over the weekend and the food was very tasty. I got the shrimp tacos with a side salad and my husband got the cheeseburger. The wait service was a little slow on the drinks though but overall I'd definitely return.,0
Percy's Pizza is a great place to go for a quick slice. The crust is always crispy and the prices are unbeatable. I especially love the $1 slices!,1
"I treated myself to a lovely brunch at the bar here in the midst of a long Central Park walk. It seems to be very popular for tourists with a large menu, yummy drink list, and expansive hours. After pursuing Yelp for a spot with a bar to sit and brunch, I am very happy I ended up here.Coffee service was really lovely, and even sitting at the bar I got to enjoy both still and sparkling water. My coffee was really deep and flavorful and they kept the refills coming - something this weary walker appreciated. Bar staff was the perfect mix of helpful without being overbearing, and left me to enjoy my eggs benny in perfect blissful peace.My dish was a-okay, though I have an overwhelming preference for canadian bacon over the cold cut style ham they used on the Smith Benedict. DO NOT skip the potatoes here! Fried up to perfect and loaded with flavor, these were some of the best home fries I've had in a minute. Grateful for a wonderful brunch! I love the versatility of this spot; awesome for solo diners and large groups alike.",0
"I have now been to Becco twice (once in the before times, and once during the pandemic) and it's now my Go To pre- or post-theatre restaurant. I recommend it to anyone looking for a meal after they see or show or if they're in that part of Midtown. They have a deceptively large amount of space, have quick service for a theatre crowd, and the food is always delectable. They have outdoor seating too (a pandemic addition), which is great for people watching when the weather is good.They have Daily Pasta Preparations where you can order that and get unlimited pasta from the three varieties they made that day, it changes daily. If that isn't up your alley, the regular menu is also superb. My most recent time, I got a filet with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fish was coated with potato flakes and it was so moist and delectable. The asparagus was tender, and the mashed potatoes were perfectly garlicky. I also love getting the panna cotta for dessert. Servers are always friendly and complimentary, have a lot of patience, and are experts on the menu. They'll help you pick an entree or a wine.  Will continue to come back here when I'm up in New York!",0
"Given all the great pizza New York City has, this place is definitely below average. We tried a couple of the pizzas, and neither of them hit the spot. The pasta dish that we got, the pappardelle, was actually pretty good. We thought the wines were moderately priced, and it was a great atmosphere. A little bit on the pricey side, and a direct competitor to Prince St., Pizza given how close they are. Would recommend folks head there instead.Apparently, it's really hard to get a table, so be prepared to go during off hours, or face a big wait.",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Taim! The service was terrific, and the food was absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous, and the prices very reasonable. I especially enjoyed the Impossible Kebabs bowl, which was packed full of flavor and spices. The fries were also excellent--highly recommended!",1
"Yesterday we celebrated Easter at @thecapitalgrille . We had the Kona crusted bone in NY Strip , food was just ok ... this use to be a favorite of mine but yesterday experience wasn't the best honestly I remember this place being so much better  we use to dine here a lot pre Covid and sit at the bar ! They offer up a great wine selection! our server was fantastic ,very. Friendly and knowledgeable ! The hostess who sat us tho not so much she gave us a horrible seat away from the main dining room when we asked to move she basically said they had no other tables available because they were all reserved and something to do with the spacing for Covid not really sure what the big deal would have been we did make a reservation at 4pm and there was plenty of other options .",0
"I can't believe that i have not written a review on this, way to shame me yelp. Barn Joo is nestled in the Union square area across the street from the park. I love this place. if nothing else, get the Bee Line drink on their cocktail menu. trust me. They have really good appetizers and entrees. They also have a happy hour that includes food, take advantage of that. I love the bar. The bar has this giant moon in the middle that is amazing. they have seating outside and two levels inside. you will be asked for proof of vax.",0
"This restaurant had a cool and trendy vibe. The staff were energetic and the clientele were stylish and classy. The food was good, but expensive. The cocktails were great, and the complimentary bread was a nice touch. This is a typical high-end NYC spot.",1
"I definitely enjoyed my time at Greenhouse Hut. The gem salad was delicious and the truffles pizza was also very good. I especially enjoyed the cheeseburger - it was juicy and delicious. My only criticism would be that the junmai sangria was a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Organized a private party recently. So my review is on that plain. SCHEDULING - went very well they helped a lot and didn't need to leave a deposit. Very cool. They called to confirm and go over arrangements but the person I worked with had left so it helped to straighten things out. ARRIVAL - no one seemed to know what was going on. My reservation was as if I just reserved a large table.ACCOMMODATIONS - the room up stairs was nice and rustic looking. PREPARATION - I was a little put off because they put out regular menus instead of the prepared ones. I reminded the staff and they checked and quickly substituted the special menu. SERVICE - we had one waiter who was fabulous but I could tell he was doing double duty. Up and down stairs. FOOD - the menu items turned out very well. Everything was very good. People liked the branzino and the chicken Park. DESSERT - the daily manager came out and presented the cakes we brought and sang. Very nice touch. PRICE - with built in gratuity for 16 and drinks. Total was a little over $1,000. The waiter was so good I slipped him extra. Overall experience was good not super great.",0
"We had a great time at Blue Note last year when Chick Corea's trio was performing. The intimate setting was perfect for a great concert. The only downside was the high cover charge. However, the average price for bar seats is $15-35, so it's not too bad. The food and drinks are extra, but that's to be expected at a jazz club. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely go back.",1
"What to say? I think people have probably covered the basics in all the reviews left by me, so let me try to point out some alternative features you may not have considered about 886.1. They have special menu items which are... seasonal? All I know is they have specific items which are not featured all the time, so make sure to ask your server if there are any specials, in case he/she forgets to mention them. The special items they were serving when I visited was lychee flavored beer, and beef soup noodles (isn't this quite normal?).2. The lighting here is very... neon? I mean, it is neon, but I'm trying to think more about how it made me feel. Actually I didn't mind it in any way, but some people may not enjoy the look of the interior of the restaurant.3. There are way too many people lining up here. I've heard that this place can be a little slower, but I think the time we came is more the time that most people would try to dine here: on a Friday evening. The wait was maybe 40 minutes, and once you are seated, they don't exactly rush you, but you can't exactly eat here at a leisurely pace. If you're looking for something a little slower, consider not eating on this street, which is always way too busy.As for food, we got the pork rice, the beef noodles, the chicken wings and the lettuce wraps. None were wildly out of the ordinary, and all were good. A nice, four star kind of restaurant.",0
"I've been a fan of this restaurant since I was a little girl, and my parents have been ordering from here for as long as I can remember. Recently, their food has been lacking in flavor - I ordered noodles and rice cakes today and both dishes lacked flavor, sadly. I even asked for extra flavor in the noodles, but there wasn't any extra flavor. I'll still come back, though.",1
"Gabriel Kreuther's restaurant is absolutely perfect - every element on every plate was executed perfectly. The miso steak was a perfect smooth bite and savoriness, the seared foie was not quite as impressive a flavor as the foie terrine, but the execution was great. The smooth liver with the crisp edge and peach spread all came together in perfect balance. The Sturgeon and Sauerkraut Tart was odd but it worked. The light foam and caviar, the marine flavors, the subtle sauerkraut all came together in perfect balance. The foie gras terrine was silky smooth and buttery in flavor. The bread was fluffy and buttery. And it's dipping sauce tasted like a high end ranch. My server suggested the French Meteor beer. It was the perfect selection. This meal was worth the $300. There are few places you will get a meal this interesting and well balanced with everything cooked perfectly.",1
Great food experience. Love eating at safe gluten free restaurants. Sat outside on the street. Short staffed but that was fine. Enjoyed my drink. Had a delicious pizza. Are the whole thing! Would definitely go back.,0
"I was really impressed with this restaurant! The food was great, and thestaff was very helpful. I especially appreciated the gluten-free options they had. The only downside was that I had one annoying experience when I tried to pick out a chocolate cake for my birthday. But overall, the food was great and the staff was helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious and unique Thanksgiving dinner.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was amazing and the drinks were perfect. The atmosphere was really nice and the staff was really friendly. I would definitely come back!,1
"We came for a family dinner a few months ago. Everything was good, I would say above average, but what got my family really mad was that they definitely stole some of the lobster. We ordered two lobsters, and what they served us was very small and when we put everything together, we realized it was missing pieces. When we raised the issue to the staff, they were super attitudinous and defensive about it, and they didn't do anything about it.",0
"Tried the ""famous"" Mac and Cheese burger... completely overrated. Looks way better than it tastes (see attached picture). The mac and cheese itself was not bad, but the burger meat was of highly questionable quality and had an off-putting aftertaste. The apple poppy salad was at least edible.Had a few of the happy hour drinks, which were decent. But definitely skip out on food if you ever come here.",0
I came here two months ago. Me and my home girls were suppose to come right before the pandemic. They still honored our Pulsed deal we purchased a year ago. It was a rainy Sunday but patrons were Brunch-ing and lunching. There was only one waiter but he was very tentative. I believe his name was Eddie. The drinks were flowing and the food was delicious. We even recieved complementary lemon drop shots not that we needed them but it was a very nice gesture. It was my first time at this establishment. I had the steak and eggs and it was yummy. I will definitely be back.,0
"This review applies to both locations. I've visited each location twice; my first time at leach location I had the monthly special and one of the dumplings from the regular menu. The monthly specials are always really good, but I do not like the dumplings from the regular menu.... the last two times I've stopped by, I just got an order of the monthly special and then went somewhere nearby for dessert. The sides are ok, but are very pricey. The dumplings are actually pretty pricey too. It's fun to watch them being handmade up at the front, and their house dipping sauce is fantastic, but I can't really recommend anything other than the monthly special. My favorite monthly was the Emmy burger collaboration! I wish all the dumplings were like this.  The buratta meatball dumplings were also really good, and the lunar new year lamb dumplings were amazing. This month there is a French onion soup dimpling and I'd like to try that. So again, the specials are fun, interesting, and delicious, but you're better off going to Chinatown if you want high quality pork or veggie dumplings and you'll get them there for cheaper.",0
I came here on 9/11 on a whim.This an ode to the late happy hours back in the days. This has been a staple in the Lower East Side and it's still here. They have happy hour everyday from 5pm-10pm; $8 lychee martini and sangria. They already include the 20% gratuity. They have indoor and outdoor seating.We had the following  Sweet and Spiced Wings Southeast Red SangriaLychee Martini,0
"Yum yum. I love some yummy Ramen and haven'tHas any since before the pandemic. This location is way off the beaten path and very small.We came in late afternoon and it wasn't busy so was served rather quickly. We both had the Ton Toro Pork and added an egg. The noodles are thick and the broth is as hearty. Although my taste buds wanted some salt, I added some spicy (chili)  to the ramen and  that worked out well...was excellent.Note: no outdoor seating despite the description on Yelp saying they do have, and the portions are not small. Not sure what people are expecting but it's a nice regular size bowl of ramen.",0
"I had a great time revisiting this restaurant last Friday after hearing great things about it. The outdoor seating is perfect for warm weather, and the staff are very friendly and professional. I tried their new sourdough olive pasta and it was fantastic - definitely worth trying!",1
"Downtown Manhattan is my favorite. I love going to after work spots. Not the worst place, but pretty expensive for what it was. The bar is huge and filled with a lively after work crowd.The chicken skewers were not white meat and tasted funny. Salad was ok. Wine and beer were nice and cold and the service was friendly.",0
"I had a really good time at Downtown Manhattan. The bar is really large and has a really lively after work crowd. The chicken skewers were not white meat, but they were still really good. The salad was also pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was that the wine and beer were a bit on the expensive side. But overall, I had a really good time at Downtown Manhattan.",1
"Il Cortile was a great place to have dinner. The staff were efficient and attentive, and the wine was great. The only downside was that it was a bit noisy, but that didn't detract from the overall experience. I would definitely come back here.",1
"Came back here yesterday for restaurant week, and the food is seriously so so good. I honestly want to eat here every week.  I recommend the lamb chops and grilled octopus for either restaurant week or regular dining. The zucchini chips are to die for. Ask for a side of tzatziki The greek yogurt dessert is lovely, I have an all new appreciation for dairy from this alone",0
"The food was good, but the service was terrible. Our waitress, Jenny, was great, but our waiter was terrible. He came over and embarrassed us for not having cash, when we actually told him we were going to pay with our card. He then got the old receipt for us to fix it, which was really weird. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"*This review is only for the xiao long bao (soup dumplings).*Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much (too much = decent XLB at a Chinese restaurant in Midtown that may not even be Shanghainese). Boy did they take the bao in xiao long bao to the extreme, because the wrappers were weirdly doughy and bun-like yet they kept breaking and falling apart and releasing all the juice?? It wasn't resilient enough to hold the insides in despite its thickness. And then the inside was way too sweet, as some reviewers have noted. And the overall size of each dumpling was too big - like even bigger than Joe's - which is to me, the extreme end of the spectrum. And the price was high too: $11 for 6 pieces.",0
"I went to this restaurant for dinner the other night and it wasn't great. The menu has options for everyone, but the service and quality are sub-par compared to the prices. Our waiter looked like he didn't want to be there and we had to ask him multiple times if we could order, to refill out water, for the check, etc. The omelette I ordered came with potatoes and toast, but I ate it all because I was hungry. Overall, it was just okay.",1
"I absolutely loved the pizzas at this restaurant, but I wasn't so fortunate with the health and safety aspect. I ordered it delivered and unfortunately, I found a piece of cardboard baked into my pizza. It was really gross and I didn't even want to finish it. I'm definitely not returning, but I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Overall, I thought this restaurant was average. I wasn't very impressed with the summer rolls, they were tough to chew. The pork chop was pretty good though, and the iced coffee was really good. Overall, I would say it's worth a visit but I don't think I would come back specifically for it.",1
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The Tonkotsu broth was delicious and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The bow spicy ramen was also good, with a nice kick to it. The Kara-age was also really good, with a hint of sichuan tingly pepper. The curry beef on top of rice was also really good, and came out in just a few minutes. The only downside was that there were no restrooms available, but that wasn't a big deal. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
Very good! Enjoyed salty fried chicken and unlimited refill noodles! They are open 24/7 and have good service! Very tasty food and lots of hot tea,0
"Cosme has been one of our favorites for many years. It has now become a New York classic. This is true Mexican cuisine like you would eat at the best restaurants in Mexico City. These dishes all talk traditional Mexican food and add a creative, contemporary flavor. Everything on the menu is wonderful. The cocktails are the best.",0
"The Irish sportsbar in Midtown is a great spot for a casual meal. The bar staff are quick and efficient, and the food is fresh and delicious. We especially enjoyed the nachos and the burgers. The prices are reasonable, and we would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"This place was a real hole in the wall and it didn't seem like much. However, walking into such a cool place with t-shirts on the wall and just a small cozy atmosphere was really refreshing. The only knock I would have is that there were only two tables inside, but it's New York, so what do you expect.The food was incredible. We got the fried spring rolls as an appetizer which had a great tangy sauce to go with it. I got the Khao Mun Gai Tod (fried chicken with rice) and it was extremely tasty. The fried chicken was crunchy and juicy and had a great sauce to go with it. My friend got the Pad Thai with Tofu and he said it tasted amazing as well. I would definitely come back here if I'm in East Harlem again!",0
"Heard about this place and saw it when it opened and was thinking about doing take out...finally had a chance. Can order online or in person.Ordered steamed pork xialong bao -  however, there wasn't  much pork inside. This comes as a 4 piece (so a bit on the pricier side). Fried pork dumplings were good. Veggies spring rolls were good but didn't come with duck sauce (would have been nice). The inside of the restaurant is nicely clean and simply but nice decor.  Ordered during non-peak and food was ready within 15 minutes. Staff is friendly.",0
"We came here for dinner the other night and it was amazing. We sat indoors and felt very safe. All of the tables were spaced far apart and whenever someone got up from the table, they wore a mask. We started with the tuna tartare, mussels and green salad. The tuna tartare was amazing. It was so incredibly fresh and the sauce was on the side. It was almost like a yogurt sauce and went perfectly with the fish. The mussels were some of the best I've ever had. They were fresh and the white sauce was amazing. The bread was perfect to soak up the remaining sauce. The fries that came with it were also great and so crispy and salty. The green salad was so simple, but the dressing was amazing and refreshing. My husband got the lobster frites and the lobster was so flavorful with butter and garlic. I got the filet mignon steak frites and it was also really good, but not the best steak I've had. We also got creme brûlée for dessert and it was very good. The drinks are also amazing. You have to get the espresso martini and my husband loved the old fashioned. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",0
"I was looking forward to an authentic Chinese meal and trying the special house dinner set that my group and I ordered. Although there was a lot of food; enough to feed all 6 of us, the food was quite disappointing. Everything was just mediocre and not authentic; it almost tasted like casual Chinese take out food. The peking duck was not really crispy and just not as good as the other ones I've had before. Overall, for the price, the amount of food was ok, but the taste and quality of the food was not really worth it.",0
"We really enjoyed the special hot pot. On a cold winter day it was perfect. It came piping hot and instantly warmed us up. It had a variety of mushrooms, vegetables and vegan seafood/ meat. The size was huge too. My husband also has the scallop with fish option from the right immortals meal which was lovely. He can't consume refined sugar due to health reasons and the options here are mostly without sugar which is rare for Asian food. It felt like clean eating and felt rejuvenated. The ambiance was also relaxing and restaurant is very clean. Owner was passionate about healthy eating and checked on us during the meal. Highly recommend.",0
"The ambiance of this restaurant is so charming, it's hard to resist sitting down and spending some time there. The walls are decorated with pretty floral prints, and the tables are covered in blue-tiffany tableclothes. The cocktails were absolutely fantastic - I especially enjoyed the kanaloa and spicy redhead. The food was also quite good - the striped bass was cooked perfectly and the caraway broth added a nice soothing flavor. The only downside was that the cavatelli itself wasn't particularly memorable, but the sauce was executed very well. The service was also friendly and attentive, which made for a great dining experience overall. I would definitely recommend checking out this spot if you're in the area!",1
"Sadly, this place and its sibling locations have closed.  I wish there were other decent meat pie options to take its place.",0
"Dallas BBQ is a great place to go for some delicious food and some good frozen drinks. The wings are my favorite, and I always get them with a different sauce on the side to choose from. The chicken and waffles is also a great dish, and I always enjoy it. This place is always busy, so be prepared to wait in line.",1
"Pretty satisfying rolls. New York - it's a carbless sashimi roll, just exactly what I need. King of the Sea - overall pretty good but the king crab was tiny and just ok. Other ingredient compliment it though.",1
"Food is good, servings are big& fairly priced but service sucks. I'm used to chinatown kind of service but yee li's customer service just ruin the whole experience. The waiters avoid eye contact or pretend not to hear you. Request for ice or chili sauce or extra bowl needs 2 reminders or never comes at all or you end up serving yourself!!! For Chinese new year visit,the waiter intantly added 18+ percent tip on our bill & when i gave him cash asked me if i want my 8 dollar back on top of the added tip. Hate the feeling of getting ripped off!!! Of course i said NO! Inspite of my husband love for their dumpling noodle soup  after 2 lousy experience i dont think im coming back.",0
"3 stars for food (decent mixed paratha with aloo and paneer) and 4 stars for convenience.They're on Seamless AND open 24/7. As a boba fiend, I'm pretty hyped that I can now get Indian food and my favorite snack around the clock. Will update after I try the boba :)!",0
"Went last night for dinner and had an excellent experience! The outdoor ambiance was beautifully set - an aesthetic detail that I truly appreciate in these times. The food was delightful - I enjoyed the Eggplant Chips, as well as the Grilled Octopus, which was incredibly flavorful. My date and I also shared a bottle of Chardonnay, and split the Black Sea Bass, as neither of us were hungry enough to eat separate entrees. Very tasty  fish which was filleted with capers and a light seasoning of herbs, accompanied by a lemon which complimented the simple flavor. Service was top notch. Would love to come back again soon!",0
"Went to a happy hour at Lion's Head Tavern on Friday evening. A solid pub with strong drinks, cold beer, and tasty bar food options.Quality: A fun pub with above average bar food. I wish the draft menu was a little more diverse, but they had enough options to satisfy the entire group. All the food I tried was delicious, and some of the things I didn't try got excellent reviews. You can't go wrong with Buffalo Wings or Tater Tots. The Fried Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and the Pulled Pork, were also hits with the group. Quantity: No issue with beer pours and food comes in shareable portions.Value: $7-$11 for Draft Beers. $30 for 20 Buffalo Wings. $9 for Tater Tots.Ambiance: Lion's Head Tavern is located in the Morningside area of Manhattan. Inside it is a pretty typical packed pub, with the walls covered with memorabilia and televisions. The table setup is definitely made to maximize the space and get in as many guests inside as possible. Outside they had multiple sheltered areas, one of which we sat in. The area surrounding the pub had a lot of characters, so expect to see some interesting activity.Crowd: Packed inside and out, I was surprised about how hard many of the customers were going early on Friday.Service: A little slow on a busy Friday evening.Parking: Tough parking on a busy street.",0
"Overall, we had a decent meal at Shinsen, but the salmon rolls were not particularly good and the beef Udon was a bit bland. The chicken Katsu, however, was a good choice. The service was prompt and the prices reasonable. However, the credit card charge and the 20% tip add up, so be aware of that before you decide to dine here.",1
"I absolutely love Cheung Fun at this restaurant! The curry fish ball cheung fun is my favorite dish, and I always get it with all the sauces. The shrimp cheung fun is also delicious, and the cheung fun is perfectly chewy and slippery. The Cantonese aunties make me feel right at home, and the wait can be long sometimes but always worth it. The only downside is that they are a bit cash only, and the wait can be long on the weekends.",1
"Its truly tragic how poor service and disgruntled and unhealthy employees can truly take a wonderful experience with amazing food and toss things out the window. This was our situation last week (Late February 2020) - Around 7:30/8PM. I didn't appreciate the sarcasm from the host; we arrived 15 minutes early - to find an empty restaurant - only to be mocked by the host; Sorry - didn't appreciate your joke. From there, things went just down hill. Waitress was terribly disgruntled and could not make it more obvious that working that evening was the last thing she wanted to do. Thanks for making me feel stupid and repeating my drink over again - ""Pina Colada - Extra Frosty"".More importantly - the food was excellent; very well crafted and delicious; - ingredients were very fresh. Kudos to the Bar Tender who made me a tasty and frosty Pina Colada. Sad that the delivery and service was so poor; truly left a bad taste in our mouths - we won't be back. Killed my appetite and saddened me.I can confirm, previous comments - portions are rather skimpy. That's disappointing. Pleaded many times for more tortilla chips - they never came. Nobody cared!In short - I don't suggest this place. It tends to attract a rather irritating crowd. I got a kick out of the countless French tourists crowding the bar, speaking French in such a tone as to be obnoxious. It was a lovely touch. Hence - this is likely why staff are conditioned to act in such a away - Looks like I found my answer. A little too European for my liking. Dear Management - Feel free to reach out to me. Don't bother offering me any free meals or such the like. I don't think its appropriate to mention the waitress's name - but, I was sure glad that it said it on the receipt. In summary; - Yelpers deserve better; - Food can be great - poor service and poor attitude from staff truly took things down a notch. Stand up for yourself and avoid!",0
"This restaurant has HORRIBLY ""trained"" staff; this is a reflection of horrible management. I placed an order on the phone and when it arrived, I realized that it was incorrect. I called Grito to report this. I was told that I had to give back the incorrect CHEAPER order; they made it seem like I was trying to keep a free order. Like girl, get your life together. I am just trying to get the order that I paid for. Stop sending people less than what they paid for. So whatever... that happens.

A few minutes later, I was called back from a girl at Grito to my personal phone number; I was harrassed, called a liar and asked if I do not listen. This little NOBODY thought that she was gonna call me and belittle me.

I called back and she was calmer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke to a Leslie?? Leslie stated that she was the manager and that she was aware of the incident and everything I stated on my prior paragraph. Leslie told me that she told the NOBODY that called me that she should not have called me back and that she understands that her actions were unprofessional. If I",1
"Waiting out a snowstorm here a week ago, the pints of Guinness were poured well by a lovely Irish lass, the burgers are solid with good pub fries, and the place is well worn. This was close to Penn Station, our hotel, and MSG. Surprisingly not as touristy as I would have thought given the locale... This is definitely more of the sports pub idea, but it was fine as Gotham received some Mother Nature Whoopass and we were basically stuck inside for a few hours. Actually very reasonable to eat and pickle the liver here as well.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but I was a little confused about the waitlist process. The speakeasy on the third floor was a nice touch and made the wait a little more tolerable.",1
"John's of Times Square is a great place to go before the theater. The wait is usually short, and the portions are large so sharing is encouraged. We usually order the anti pasta salad, pizza and a couple of different pastas for our group. It's always delicious, and they even have gluten free pizza, which is pretty good.",1
"Catch is still my favorite restaurant in town, and I love coming here for restaurant week brunch! The food is always delicious, and the prices are unbeatable during the week. I got the hellfire roll, salmon a la plancha with kale pesto, and the vanilla Oreo banana pudding, and all of them were delicious. The tuna on the hellfire roll was very fresh, and the salmon was perfectly cooked. I also need to figure out a way to get my hands on that kale pesto recipe - definitely one of my favorite sauces! The vanilla Oreo banana pudding is a restaurant week brunch dessert special - it was a larger portion than I was expecting served in a mason jar, more pudding like than Oreo like, with a lot of berry and fruity tones to it! I was a fan, although it was slightly different than what I was expecting! I highly recommend Catch no matter the meal or time of year, but there's no doubt that restaurant week is a prime time to make a visit and try out some new dishes, too!",1
"I was looking forward to brunch at this restaurant, but unfortunately the food didn't quite live up to my expectations. The portions were smaller than what I'm used to, and the food itself wasn't particularly delicious. The service was good, but I didn't feel particularly welcomed or at home here. The atmosphere isnice though.",1
I had a good time at this restaurant! The chicken bowl I ordered was really good and the place was really busy when I got there. The app made ordering really easy and my order was ready in just 6 minutes. I'll definitely be back!,1
"The spice level was off for me, but otherwise this place was fine. They were quite crowded on a Thursday night, so they found a folding table behind the bar and set it up outside for us. The drinks were flavorful though & masked the alcohol until I left feeling solidly drunk after a couple. It's a bit pricey at $16/drink, but I would recommend it if you're looking for a place to sit and enjoy a drink.",1
"I stopped in to this Vietnamese restaurant for lunch on a recent weekend trip to town. I was really impressed with the seated QR ordering system – it was really easy and convenient. The place was pretty busy when we arrived, but thankfully the wait was not long. The food was good – I especially enjoyed the summer rolls (which were nothing extraordinary, but still tasted great). The limeade soda was also really authentic and refreshing. The banh mi sandwich was also very good – the bread was crispy and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The meat in the sandwich was a bit on the bland side, but overall it was a decent sandwich. The pho was also very good – it was very flavorful and didn’t need any extra doctoring. The service here was excellent – the food came out quickly and the staff was friendly and welcoming. Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch at this Vietnamese restaurant and would definitely recommend it. Prices are high, but worth it for the quality of the food.",1
"This place gets the stars purely for the food - which was great. Authentic. Homemade. The man waiting on us didn't really give a shit about us waiting forever to been seen or order (the 3 men next to us sat down after us and their order was taken before we were even addressed). I asked for an ice water 3 times and I'm fairly sure he just flat out ignored me. We ordered the soup dumplings with our order and they never came out. We mentioned it to him when he tried to bring our check, and said ""#1? Ok."" Like he was taking our order again. These dumplings were forgotten about again as more folks orders came out of the kitchen. Like I said, aside from the terrible service (which I doubt they even care about or would try and correct?) the food was good and inexpensive. We mostly had Dim Sum. Everything I ate I liked.  Definitely get the soup dumplings. The lobster spring roll was great also and the turnip short bread.",0
"So happy to have a lunch teishoku (combo) here in NYC! The price is definitely NYC level too......however everything from una-don, soba, and sashimi tasted pretty good. I think it's pretty good Japanese food for the city (I have been disappointed multiple times) so will probably come back again",0
"Horrible service. Popped in here for a drink and a snack mid day on Saturday. We actually weren't sure if they were open bc there were no patrons and the staff was inside just sitting around at tables talking and folding napkins. We asked if they were open and they said yes so we sat outside. We ordered two lavender spritz and croissants. The server told us if we wanted a croissant we would have to buy the eggs Benedict ... umm what? I informed them that their pop tent sign said they had them available, but still nope no croissants for us. We saw they had biscuits and jam on the menu so we ordered those instead. 20 mins goes by no server, no drinks and no biscuits. Finally, after walking in to check they bring out the drinks. No biscuits. We ask about them and the server says they will be right out. 15 mins later and we've now finished our drinks and no biscuits. We get the check and they charged us for the biscuits. They finally took them off but such bad service for a casual pop in. I can't even imagine an entire meal here.",0
"I had gotten home from school, and I was famished! I was craving a burger, but I didn't want to get Five Guys (the one close to Columbia is more often a miss than a hit). So I looked through my UberEats app, and found Bareburger. I decided on something simple, and got their standard burger. I got grilled onions, cheese, ketchup, and mustard... nothing fancy. After waiting less than half an hour, I had my food in front of me, ready to eat.The burger was delicious! It was feeling, but did not leave me with a food coma. Unlike the burgers from Five Guys, this burger joint actually prepped my burger with a fine balance of ingredients. I'm impressed with the burgers here, and I hope they open up a location closer to school or home.",0
"Tabetome: We were here back in November of 2019.Location: right besides a beautiful park between 8 and 9th Street on Avenue A. You can walk from second avenue or Delancey street station. We were looking on Yelp for our option of Ramen and this spot showed up and we can join the waitlist as provided by Yelp. By the time we arrived we were given a table seat. If you didn't want to wait there are available bar seats. After reading the menu, we decided on the tonkotsu chasiu jiro Ramen. Description provided states pork broth brewed for over 60 hours, so this better be good. Its $18 for one bowl. Our ramen came out fairly quick. The broth was rich, fatty, and thick. After multiple sips, it became salty. Cha siu tasted ok wish it was thicker. Still have an aftertaste afterwards, needed to drink lots of water. The noodle itself looks like the Chinese lo mien.",0
"Bierhaus NYC is a great place to go for a drink or to watch a live band. The atmosphere is really enjoyable and the prices are affordable. I really enjoyed their spiked apple cider and the biercheese dip. The only downside is that the wings weren't very good. Overall, I would recommend this bar to anyone looking for a good time.",1
"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The servers are incredibly rude and unhelpful. We made a reservation/waitlist on yelp, but when we got there they didn't care. My friend had given me her order because she went to their other location and we were trying to get food before a show but the rude guy at the desk would not seat me despite me being ready to place BOTH orders. The food is usually something to look for but when the service is this bad it's not even worth waiting for.",1
"No complaints here!  We ended up watching the finale of the European soccer championship here, after failing to get a seat at our first choice.  We could have done worse, although I think we were the only people rooting for Italy.  Service was excellent - our server was prompt and friendly, and kept our drinks and snacks coming.  My daughter's bacon burger was delicious, our chips with queso adequate.  Mostly, I appreciated the friendly, laid back vibe, and the excellent people watching from the semi-enclosed space.",0
"I came here for an early dinner on a Friday afternoon with my family. This is probably the most popular Chinese restaurant on the block. I was excited to try this place since they have Hunanese dishes and I'm from Hunan. We ordered Miss Lou's Famous Beef Stew, Mountain Baked Fish, and the Stir Fried Eggplant & String Beans. It was a lot of food since the portions were large. The best dish was Miss Lou's Famous Beef Stew since it's a Hunanese dish not found in most Chinese restaurants. It's a hot and sour soup with thinly sliced beef, mushrooms, and noodles. There was a lot of ingredients and the broth was flavorful. The Mountain Baked Fish was okay but not much fish. There was definitely a lot of vegetables though (tofu skin, lotus root, bean sprouts). The Stir Fried Eggplant & String Beans was good too, very garlicky. Service was fast and friendly. I would come back and try other dishes. It's a bit pricey but the portions were large, lunch is definitely a better deal.",0
"Overall, I thought this restaurant was pretty good. The food was good, and the service was on point. The only critique I have is that the outdoor seating was a bit uncomfortable - it was quite loud outside! But overall, I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try!",1
"Restaurant week, you have my heart. Butter squash ravioli, you also have my heart. Really everything about this place is a hit from the decor, to the waiters, and the food (obviously). I got the 2 course Restaurant Week option, so for $26 you choose an appetizer and entree (or I guess entree and desert if you are feeling like having a wild lunch hour). My appetizer was the Polpettini (pork meatballs). I loved loved loveeeed the actual meatballs. Crispy on the outside and really flavorful and soft on the inside. But I was not a big fan at all of the purple/grayish sauce they came in. It's a very minor detail and just a personal preference. My entree was the Cappellacci Di Zucca, basically just butter squash raviolis. I tried a little of everyones dishes and these stole the show. They were so incredibly light and buttery. I'd get them again in a heart beat. I came here with some coworkers on our lunch break and unfortunately didn't realize how quickly time was flying by. We had to ask our waiter if there was anyway to put a bit of a rush on our entrees coming out because before we knew it, 1:00 was looming. He was very kind and did what he could to bring it out quickly. A few of us got dessert (the 3rd course) so he wrapped it up to go. So I'd most definitely would like to come back with no time restrictions when I can be shamelessly talked into a few cocktails and a very leisurely meal. (The cocktails part won't be hard).",0
"I was disappointed by the quality of the tsukemen here. The broth was not rich and creamy: it was oily, separated, and much too garlicky. The noodles were chewy and a little on the overcooked side. The meat is no longer charred and succulent, it is flabby and limp.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay at Ulysses Folk House. The drinks were decent, but the oysters were a bit pricey for what you get. The service was friendly, though.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The cocktails were OK, nothing to write home about, but the peking duck was the highlight of the night. The chopstick holders were adorable little pandas in various positions of repose, and this was the cutest and most memorable part of the restaurant for me. The restaurant did take precautions to be Covi safe - we were seated indoors with other patrons, and they did not space out, so they put up barriers between the tables. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a dinner out on a Saturday!",1
"I didn't pick this restaurant, and I'm not sure that I would have landed on it, but I'm glad that we ended up eating at Khe-Yo. We ordered the spring rolls, salmon curry, and a pork dish with noodles and broth that was recommended by the waitress.We opted to eat outside, and it was very nice, but a little chilly (in the middle of June what!!!). Luckily, they had electric heaters for us. I liked that it wasn't too crowded. I think there was only one other couple who was eating outside a few tables down from us. The spring rolls were tasty, the salmon curry was good on the jasmine rice and the pork dish was interesting. I'm not sure that it was one of the places I would go out of my way to come back to because there are so many good places to choose from in NYC, but I'm very glad that we ate here.",0
"Came through for a bowl of pho around 4:00. They had a table available so my girlfriend and I headed inside. We received small complimentary cups of tea, then glasses of pinot grigio, served chilled. I tried both the L3 Pho w/ medium-cooked steak and the grilled pork banh mi. The sandwich was light and crispy: tender tasty strips of pork, cucumber, jalapenos, cilantro, shredded carrots, in a nice baguette. The mayo was light and added lubrication for chewing through each delicious bite. The pho was fine. Not the richest broth, but light, simple. The bean sprouts and basil on the side were quite fresh, and the cilantro and jalapeno slices provided flavor. The steak was also fresh, making for an adequate, albeit restrained, bowl of noodle soup. I will commend the excellent service and note that proper hygiene and sanitation procedures are in place. Also, the pho is super cheap; most bowls are under $10, which is very competitive.",0
"Great Hawaiian spot! Came here on a weekday for restaurant week and had a great meal with a friend. Started off with the Pork Jowl musubi, which was pretty decent.For my first course I got the Big-Eye Tuna Poke, which was great. The tuna was divineee. My friend had the Berkshire Pork Cutlet, which I got to try a bite of and it was pretty tasty. My second course was the Mochiko Chicken Loco Moco. So good! Lot going on here with the chicken, egg, mac salad, gravy, and rice but it all goes really well together. My friend ordered the Mentaiko Tagliatelle, which I tried a bite of. Really tasty seafood pasta dish. Finally, for dessert we shared the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake. This was the only thing on restaurant week menu that isn't on their regular menu, which is such a shame cause it was amazing! Easily my favorite thing we ate.Overall, had a great meal here. We left feeling both satisfied and very full. Definitely worth checking out!",0
"Joe's Pizza is a great place for a slice of pizza. The thin crust is what makes it special, and the sauce and cheese layers are thick and delicious. It's also great that it's located in the Financial District, which makes it a great place to go for a slice. The white slice is also a great option, with layers of ricotta cheese and garlic that make it a safe choice. However, it can be a bit expensive, so it might be best to order two slices.",1
"Personally a 3.5. most of their dishes are pretty simplistic, the veggie ramen is very bare imo and they intriguingly put iceberg lettuce in both the ramen and the bento. In terms of the ramen and the veggie sides on the pork belly bento, the only thing I was impressed with was the pork belly. Really good flavor on that and tasted very good with rice. The sides were definitely lack luster, more iceburg lettuce and then two pieces of broccoli with what I assume was oyster sauce. Also a very lightly flavored tea egg. The skin on the pork belly was also extremely chewy which was interesting since I'm much more used to a soft and tender skin so I was a little suspicious of that. Overall I think the food here is very simplistic and could be good for a quick bite of Chinese food, but with China Town a 10 min walk away you might be happier if you tried over there.",0
"My coworkers and I frequent this location for happy hour after work. Regardless if you only order a drink or a full meal, they provide chips and salsa (like how Italian restaurants serve bread and butter) which is free. This time, my coworker asked for a second serving of nachos which the waiter/manager begrudgingly took the tiny metal canister to refill and says absolutely nothing. Upon receiving the bill, we saw a $4 charge for ""chips."" We inquired why we were charged since we've never been charged before for chips. The same waiter/manager stated, ""first one is free; you asked for second."" This was not written anywhere on their menu or verbally informed by him. We asked to speak to the manager and he said he was, we said it's not professional to charge for something he did not voice when we asked for refills. He couldn't care less. Unfortunately, we won't be visiting this spot any longer.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious fries at this restaurant. I enjoyed sitting on the sidewalks and observing a new quiet Manhattan. The staff were really sweet, it was late at night and they still took us for a drink and food (we had to order something with our drinks - law!). I wonder what the brunch is like, I wouldn't put it past them that it's great!",1
"After being in New York City, both living in and visiting, for umpteen years I finally dined at Delmonico's.  It wasn't like I never heard of it,  but the inclination didn't exist. Until now.I have to admit that the experience was wonderful and I wonder why I hadn't come sooner. (Well,  one good reason is the number of great places to eat in NYC, and another is I rarely hang out downtown).We had a reservation and courteously were greeting and promptly seating at a nice cozy table at the edge of the main dining room..I liked that they use a line of narrow mirrors on the wall so the person facing the wall still can look back into the dining room. Nice design touch.The noise level in a full dining room is rather deafening, so even with all the soft surfaces you need to talk loudly.  That's the primary downside.I wouldn't characterize the menu as super creative and it's essentially a steak house, as they well note.Our waiter, most professional, told us about the specials and the halibut he mentioned hit a chord with both of us.  It came with lobster on the top, which frankly they could have done without, and also accompanied with green beans.  The halibut was fantastic, well prepared and moist.We started with a salad that was very well made.One thing we had that was totally new as an accompaniment was roasted radishes. What a surprise as they were super wonderful.  Never would I have thought of roasting a radish, but the flavor exuded from the slices.This was all washed down with a bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay Reserve, a perfect pairing for the meal.We left very satisfied and it was worth the time to visit, and the cost too.Very old world New York, but ever so nice.",0
"I went to this restaurant for a quick bite to eat and I was really pleased with everything. The soup dumplings were especially good, but I didn't think the duck dan dan noodles were great. However, the spare ribs and scallion pancakes were both really good. The only downside was that the restaurant wasn't licensed to serve alcohol yet, which made the experience a bit more challenging. Overall, though, I thought the food was great and I would definitely recommend it.",1
Price fixe lunch specials ( reasonable prices )Comfortable chairs Food is good ( had the chicken pad thai )staff is attentive.,0
"Based solely on beer, I wish it had more selection. At least they have Guinness on draft as their namesake.Nice interior and the service was ok. Waitress forgot some of our drinks.They do flights for those who like to try things.Not my first pick, but I'd come back if asked to.",0
"This place is great! I came here with a friend for coffee but I will return for meals both brunch and dinner. The place itself looks like a traditional restaurant clean and nicely laid out, with the really nice lighting and looks upscale. They have some nice window seating as well. The food selections look interesting and it's in a busy area with a lot of offices around. I think they do have lunch options as well. The service was great, Really friendly and helpful and willing to make changes to suit allergy requirements. When my group is coming a little bit late, they allowed us to get started and seated before everyone was there. Given the other great reviews, and my coffee experience, I'll definitely be back. Definitely try the Raf coffee it's incredible!",0
"Capizzi is a cozy pizzeria in Hell's kitchen. This area near Penn station is usually a dearth of good food. However Capizzi delivered on a satisfying and tasty meal for us.My friends and I went here after a conference. The space is small. Unfortunately locals and tourists also know about Capizzi so the wait was about 40 minutes.The pizzas were so satisfying. The three of us shared the following.Burrata- this arrived with artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and prosciutto. The cheese was so creamy and fresh. Uovo Pizza- this came loaded with fresh baked eggs and pancetta. It was so satisfying and had a deep rich flavor, thanks to the cheese, sauteed onions and the pancetta. This was my favorite pie.Mushrooms and prosciutto pie- this was delicious with a good crisp crust. The mushrooms and prosciutto were very good. The special of the day was in the Nutella pizza dessert topped with berries. We shared this as dessert. It was such a satisfactory meal.I would definitely return!",0
"I recently had a great meal at this restaurant. The pork katsu donburi was especially delicious, and it came with three sides - rice, miso soup, and pickled vegetables. The price was also very reasonable, at just under $13. The wait time was also minimal, which was great. Unfortunately, I had a less-than-great experience here a few months ago, but it seems like things have improved since then. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant - the food is great, and the prices are very reasonable.",1
"This restaurant was overpriced and had mediocre food. The service was great, though.",1
"I always love trying new Chinese restaurants when I am in NYC.  Since I normally don't stay on this side of the city very often I thought I would give Hunan Manor a try as they showed to be right around the corner from The Renwick Hotel on E. 40th.  I placed my order: Spring rolls, sweet & sour Chicken w/white rice, Pumpkin rolls and a ginger ale, directly off of Yelp (GrubHub).  The order time showed it would take a little under an hour as I ordered this just before 7PM on a Tuesday night.  I didn't think much of the time delay as I was working from the hotel and that seemed appropriate based on the cold rainy night and the timing.  35 minutes later I have a Knock on my door and my food was being delivered with a smile.  Not only was it being delivered early, it was hot, like right out of the WOK hot!I had put in the notes that I would like extra S&S Sauce, so they provided me a pint, which was exactly what I wanted.  The only reason I am giving them three stars was that they forgot my white rice, which is one of the reasons for wanting more S&S sauce.  The Chicken was super crispy, however it did feel more like batter than chicken on some pieces.  The Pumpkin rolls were not what I was expecting so I only had 1 of the 6 that came.  All that said, I was very pleased with the order process, the delivery process and the food overall. Again would have loved to have had my rice but it was still quite nice.",0
"Porteno is a great place to go after seeing Sleep No More, as the late night crowds provide a good atmosphere and the food is generally good. However, the chicken breast was pretty dry and the tuna tartare was the best thing on the menu. The chocolate dessert was also very good.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was amazing and the service was very friendly. I would definitely come back and recommend it to others.,1
"A new takeout place has opened on the UWS serving chicken wings, tenders, sides and salads.  They are right next to the Mermaid Inn (same owners).  They are only offering pickup and delivery (no dine-in).  The prices are reasonable. They offer family platters as well as combo platters along with a nice selection of sides.All that being said, I finally tried the place and it fell short in every way.  The chicken was dry and the coating fell off with every dip in the dipping sauce.  There was no flavor to the coating either.  Just greasy, dry, bland chicken.The Mac and cheese was an utter let down.  There was no cheese except for on the top.  It tasted like cooked noodles tossed in oil with some crunchy crumbling on top.  The tots were good, though a bit greasy.  And the waffle fries were fine.  Everything was cold and damp by the time I got it home (I live one Avenue and 4 blocks away).Service was friendly at the door.  It was a bit confusing as to how to order.  You have to order online and wait for a text.  There's no counter to place an order.I really thought this place would be great, given Mermaid Inn is fantastic.  But sadly, it's worth skipping.  Definitely not worth the $40 we spent.  Much better food to be had at Blondies, or probably any other bar in the neighborhood.",0
We had a great meal at this restaurant. The service was attentive and the food was delicious. The temperature check at the door for bathroom use was a nice touch. The tables were spaced apart with a space heater for every table. One igloo too! We will definitely be back.,1
"Kenn's Broome Street Bar holds a historic place in the transition of Soho from a gritty manufacturing district to the trendy, artsy neighborhood of today. Opened in 1972, it became the unofficial clubhouse of the earliest artists who gentrified the area. Maplethorpe was a regular as were Robert Boyles, Robert Jacks, Ken Tisa and many others. Still serving the best drinks and burgers around.",0
"I had a really good time at this restaurant! The chicken dosa were really tasty and I really liked the ghost pepper sauce they used. The paneer dosa were also good, but I found them to be a bit spicy. The naan was really good, though. It was full of flavor and didn't feel dry at all. I also really liked the decor and the cocktails on the menu. The service was also really good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! I ordered the burger with gluten-free bread and seasoned french fries - both of which were delicious. I also got to try the Brussel Sprouts and their cucumber and tomato salad/salsa. Both dishes were very flavorful and well-cooked. The delivery was also really fast, and I loved the dining experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"***Authentic, Filling, Highly Recommend***This is a delivery review only. I enjoy this place so much that I've ordered here too frequently these days. Food is authentic and very delicious. Highly recommend the soup dumplings but you truly can't go wrong with any of the menu items.",0
"I had the best tater tots at this restaurant! They were cooked perfectly and didn't need ketchup - they were really crispy. The portion was generous, too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious tots!",1
"Came here with our dog Gerbert and sat on the stools in the front, which was so nice of them (so dogs friendly!). Immediately ordered the burger and two $4 happy hour dishes: the mozzarella and basil and the mini pork lasagna.The burger is not your usual ketchup-lathered burger. This ones got sophistication. It drips with a cheddar cheese I've never seen before - this melted almost frothy cheese along the edges and top of the burger. The bun is delicious, the meat is soft and fresh, the char on the meat is yummy. The whole thing is great, just not necessarily that gotta have it-kind of burger. It's borderline too classy for me.The mozzarella and basil is so fresh and delicious. It's served at room temperature (like a good restaurant should!) and I'd get the full appetizer next time. The mini pork lasagna is interesting, but I'm not such a pork fiend so kinda bowed out early on that one. I'm not rushing back here, but it's a great plan b when your favorite restaurant is booked.",0
"We had the tasting menu and the wine pairing. Service was very good, and some of the dishes were good, but some were kind of hilarious. The first course, tuna tartare, was basically poke with the seaweed salad at the bottom. Portions were also quite small, although you do fill up as it goes and I had 2 rolls so I was full in the end. The beef Wellington was the best dish in the whole menu. The fish course (halibut) in my opinion was the worst, the texture of the fish was tough and dry. I'd recommend for a romantic date or a girls night out. If I go again I'd go for the prix fixe instead of the tasting menu, and avoid the halibut.",0
"I was disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The waiter told me that the lunch special wasn't offered on weekends, but when I asked him, he said it was still available. That was false advertising, and I didn't appreciate it. The place was supposed to open at 11, but it was almost 11:15 when they finished setting up. The T-bone steak we ordered was tough to cut, and the edges were burnt. The thai iced tea was good, but it was overly sweet. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"This will be short as we only got delivery, but...everything was delivered and it was pretty good, even as delivery. I would order from them again.",0
"No idea why this place has bad reviews, the food tastes just like a normal decent mom and pops diner. Place is clean, service is quick, and the staff is polite and attentive. The breakfast sandwich hoagie was very good, everyone else got burgers and sandwiches. The fries are crispy and on point. The prices are on par with NYC. I have zero complaints, eat local, and eat here for a quick and easy diner experience.",0
I always love coming to Bravo Pizza. The flavor is great and the price is reasonable. The staff is always friendly and I always feel like I'm in good hands. I highly recommend this restaurant.,1
"Overall, I was disappointed by the food availability at this restaurant. However, the ikasumi uni ikura soba (cold squid ink soba) and ice tempura (dessert) were both really good. The service was really good as well. I would definitely come back for those two dishes, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend the rest of the menu.",1
"Ippudo is a great place to go for a vegetarian ramen. The broth is soy-flavored, but it's still very tasty. The truffle fries were a nice bonus, and I can't wait to go back and try the other ramen options. The only downside is that you can't bring your coffee into the waiting area, so you have to wait until you're seated.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always hot and soupy, and they have a lot of options on the menu. I was disappointed that they didn't have kimchi fried rice on the menu, but other than that, this place is great! Worth the price!",1
"I give Joe G's three stars, but only because my husband loved his pepperoni pizza so much. My pizza had something to be desired... a margherita pizza has always come with tomatoes and plenty of basil, and mine had neither. Someone else in our group help the same and ordered more in the side. Prices were okay (between $12-15 per pizza and small enough that each person should order their own). I wasn't totally wow-ed by this place, especially because it had come so highly recommended. We were also a bit bamboozled by the entrance, because you have to walk DOWN stairs into it from the street (but it was neat regardless). A couple of blocks from Times Square, not far from Rock Center and Central Park so the location is pretty key if you don't want to venture too far away. But, be assured, Little Italy is a 15 minute train ride away and would certainly offer higher quality stuff.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for a quick lunch, and the pizza came out quickly enough. However, the service was a bit meh. I remember that I couldn't even flag down the server because they were inside talking on the phone... on something that was not work related. I had to go inside to get the check. The pizza was ok. I also like to make pizza at home and I do use King Arthur flour for baking. If anything, the flavors were interesting enough for me to consider remaking it at home. Nothing impressive, would wish that the server was a bit more attentive since we were only there for less than an hour.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The menu is huge, but each dish has a unique flavor and spice that makes it stand out. The service was a bit slow, but that wasn't really a problem. The only thing I would say is that the Firecracker Chicken was a bit lacking in chicken, but the rest of the dish was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious Asian food!",1
"The drinks were good but I really was not impressed with the food. The bar staff were absolutely fantastic and serve me up some of the best Old Fashioneds I've had anywhere.For apps, my crew and I had some kind of buffalo chicken chunks as well as but I think we're mozzarella balls. Both were easily forgettable. The texture of the Buffalo sauce on the chicken was strange in a way that I just can't seem to readily discern.For dinner, we had ziti in marinara sauce, chicken pesto, a fantastic mixed green salad (which everyone said was the star of the show... Kind of ironic a place known for its meatballs) as well as the namesake meatballs.The ziti was not cooked al dente. It was unpleasantly chewy, and some pieces were still rather firm. The sauce lacked any real flavor. Ditto for the chicken pesto. I didn't try the meatballs because I'm pretty sure they had pork in them and I don't eat pork.For me, the stars of the show were the ice cream cookie sandwiches for dessert. They offered both chocolate chip and dark chocolate cookies which were both very good on their own, but a huge scoop of rich vanilla ice cream between them... Now it's a party.All in all, I enjoyed my visit. The staff were absolutely fantastic and although the drinks and desserts were good, the food just wasn't to my taste.",0
"Went here with some friends before clubbing and enjoyed the ambience. Wait can be super long during Friday and Saturday; it was about 75 min give or take for a medium table (3-8 ppl). The interior is tight with a somewhat low ceiling and with pretty good kpop music. We got the watermelon soju to share which seems like there is a very low amount of soju. Apparrently there should be some carbonation too, according to a friend that went here 2 years ago. Although alcohol is expensive, it felt like a rip off drinking mostly watermelon juice that is so easy to make. Regardless, it was a fun experience and is only worth going with friends, as a lot of the food and drinks here are marked up 3-4x the price of even a typical NYC restaurant (e.g., $15 for a side of French fries)",0
"OBAO is a must-visit restaurant in New York City. The food is amazing - both Thai and Vietnamese dishes are blended perfectly together to create a delicious, unique experience. The service is great, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I highly recommend OBAO to anyone visiting the city.",1
"I really wanted to love this place but i can only say i really liked it. Warning: this location is super small and it gets packed quick! I have been here over the summer and it's not a good idea lol. Like I said, this location is very small and it gets super steamy quick. I decided to give this place another shot during the winter time and I think because it's so small, they seated us really close to another couple. As the couple started to leave, they had us move inside so another group can sit on the outside. I mean, I understand you need to get your money and all, but i was just uncomfortable. He always gets the mega and i got the spicy one i forgot the name lol and they were both very good. But their eggs aren't the best i've had in my ramen days. It could've been more flavorful. At the end, we had finished our meals first but waited for the group who sat next to us to leave so it wouldn't be such a hassle to ask them to get up in the middle of their meal. I was just not comfortable here and I am pretty sure that made my dining experience less appealing.",1
"Tasty food and a great atmosphere! The service was quick and fully masked which is awesome. The outdoor seating has lots of flowers and plants which makes for a great outdoor dining experience. The torta itself had a great bun, chicken that was perfectly crisp and had so many flavors inside. The avocado was reallyyyy good and fresh. Wish the size of the food was larger or came with some sides and I think the price is a bit steep for what felt like more of a snack than a full on dinner. Solid experience though and flavorful food in a fun outdoor area",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The cocktails were excellent, and the food was delicious. I especially loved the lobster salad - it was perfectly seasoned and very filling. The service was great, and the location was perfect - close to all of the action in Covid. Overall, a great experience!",1
"My friends and I were allured into Thursday Kitchen by their signature glowing LED light cube CAPRI-THURSDAY clear pouch drinks. When it was time to order, my friends ordered the drinks and were both carded. When the waitress looked at me, I told her I did not intend to order a drink. She asked me to show her my ID, which I did not have on me. AGAIN, I was not ordering a drink, I did not understand why she needed to see my ID. I was severely upset by the way the waitress treated us the entire time. When it was time to order our food, we picked 3 dishes. She kept on insisting that all their restaurant's dishes were tapas-style and it must've been our first time here because usually, groups order 2-3 dishes per person. One of my friends has been here before, so no, it was not all of our's first time. We did not intend to have a full meal here, and nor is there a spending minimum at the restaurant. As consumers, we can choose to order only one dish per person, and don't forget, with the two drinks, we are already spending around $27 per person before tax and tips. Not only did the waitress peer her eyes on our table the entire time to make sure I wasn't sipping on my friends' drinks, but she also went ahead and force us to ""order"" more dishes by suggesting to put in more dishes. We did not want to order more dishes.The steak was not tender enough. The soft shell crab was over-fried. The kimchi paella was too dry. The popcorn ice cream was the only memorable dish, and the only item worth visiting for.",0
"Can I have born, bred and buttered engraved on my resume please?Despite not having a reservation in the middle of lunch hour, we were seated pretty quickly. Ordered the signature chicken and waffles with sides of yams, collard greens, and mac and cheese. I won't lie, it did take a bit for our food to arrive but, I also think that's just a pandemic product (understaffing and whatnot). Our waitresses were trying their best!The food itself, was yummy. The waffles were soft and sweet, the chicken fried and well seasoned. The strawberry butter, wasn't too crazy about. Too much of it had like a strawberry candy sweetness to it. The yams were sugary, and the collard greens were nice bitter break from the richness.The mac and cheese though. Omg, probably one of the best mac and cheeses I have ever had. Cheesy with a considerable crust on top, and flavorful, most importantly. Honestly, I would just go back for a plate of that!",0
"Last night we went to the pizza place down the street. 

We ordered a regular pizza, a vegan pizza and an arugula salad to be delivered. 

The regular pizza was just okay. 

The vegan pizza was fair. 

Neither pizza had much cheese on them and it was annoying that they weren't labeled so we had to taste them to figure out which was which..... 

Not easy, and not good for the vegan who didn't want to mistakenly eat the wrong pie. 

We had asked for the cheese and dressing to be on the side for the arugula salad. 

The dressing was on the side but the cheese was not; it had to be picked out so the vegan could also have some. 

It was also a tremendous disappointment; it was just a container of arugula, the cheese (infuriatingly on the salad already), 3 olives, and about a tablespoon of chopped red onion..... 

We had to dig through the arugula to even find the few little pieces of onion. 

Crazy expensive for just a bunch of lettuce and 2 mediocre at best pies.",1
"Overall, the food was decent, but I was disappointed that they didn't have a full brunch menu. The egg sandwich was good, but I wished it had more balance against the tomatoes. The outdoor seating was nice spaced out if you are concerned about being too close to other groups of people.",1
I ordered delivery from here and only really enjoyed 1 out of the 3 dishes I ordered. I got the following:-pork soup dumplings: these were just ok. The dough was very thick and the middle of the dumpling just seemed empty. -pork dumplings with chili oil: these were very good. I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the dish. I would recommend getting these.-beef with bok choy: this wasn't good at all. I don't get why this got such good reviews. It hardly had any flavor and the beef was mushy. It almost tasted like the beef was fried and then the sauce was soaked up. The texture of this was not good at all.I don't think I would order delivery from here again.,0
Went for a quick lunch and only ordered wings and drinks. They had no lunch specials!!!! Busy time square and no lunch specials! We ordered the buffalo and burbon wings with a side of fries to share. Wings came out hot and crispy. The fries came out on a salad plate. We quickly returned them for the price the portion size was lacking. We ordered two flavored lemonades which were good and came with free refills. It was an ok experience not in a eush to go back.,0
"This preppy restaurant has great food, service, and vibes.Been wanting to checkout JG Melon for a long time and finally made it up here. There was a long wait but Deff worth it. We got seated at a private 2 person outdoor/indoor spot and it was puppy friendly so we brought our pup. The place was vey clean and the wait staff was super attentive which was great.I ordered the mozzarella sandwich for an appetizer which was really good with the lemon slice.For the main I got the Bacon Cheeseburger as I feel that is where all the hype is for this place with cottage fries and she got the Turkey Burger.The bacon cheeseburger was good Deff did not live up to the hype but was happy I got it. Prob try it again see if I was there on an off night.The cottage fries were so airy and round and just awesome. I've never had fries like that.The Turkey burger!!!!! WOW! This things was amazing! Let me say this again, It was amazing. The flavor profile just popped. I would suggest this to anyone even those who aren't Turkey burger people. Sooooooooooo good!For desert we got the pecan pie and dang this was so goood one of better pecan pies I have had. Deff suggest!In short:- Cool preppy Restaurant- Great date spot- Great Service- Amazing Turkey Burger- Will Deff be back",0
"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. There is an option to sit at the hibachi grill or the regular tables without ordering hibachi.I ordered the hibachi steak and scallops. Each hibachi item comes with two shrimp, a choice of fried rice with veggies or noddles with veggies, and a choice of soup or salad. The fried rice, veggies, and shrimp tasted great. I thought the steak and scallops were salty and made it hard to finish. I only realized after I left that they did not serve the soup that I ordered. They did give a decent size portion of everything.The service for most of the groups' order was mostly good-I didn't get my drink until halfway through the meal which wasn't ideal, but not a huge deal. One friend didn't enjoy the service experience at all because they didn't bring out the non hibachi food he ordered.If you come for the hibachi, I would recommend trying to hype up the chief since this makes the experience more exciting. Overall, I thought this experience was decent, but not I place that I would like to try again.",0
"The restaurant is well set up for outdoors dining. There were a lot of tables with a lot of space. The waitstaff seemed to be spread a bit thin. This was OK because it allowed our meal to proceed at a leisurely pace. Cocktails and wine by the glass were good. The salads were excellent. My wife really liked her branzino. My salmon burger was OK. The frites were very good. The cappuccino was a bit watery. 

Nice place for a meal. 

3.5 stars, rounded up for the pandemic.",1
"Came here for take out and got the Pepper Boy egg sandwich. Food was out quickly and was very hot and fresh. Tasted great! My only complaint was that it was kind of small and could have used more sauce. The eggs, cheese, bread and peppers were all great! Thanks!",0
"Great food, especially for vegetarians and vegans. I only wish the drinks were cheaper - or stronger for their price.",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The service was great and the food came out quickly. I really enjoyed the chips and guacamole, as well as the vanilla boozy shake. However, I was very disappointed with the burgers. They had no flavor at all and the fries were super soggy. Overall, I had a really enjoyable experience and would definitely return.",1
"A pretty good breakfast.Nearly everything on the menu can be prepared gluten-free.Was not a huge fan of being ignored by the hostess upon entering.  They had a hostess stand by the main street entrance.  They had a ""please wait to be seated"" sign by the inner door off the adjacent hotel.  The hostess ignored me at each, and I simply wasn't sure where to stand for a table until she graced me with acknowledgement after the 5th or 6th passing.  It was unnecessarily confusing.The coffee was ridiculously bitter.  I like strong coffee, but this just tasted bad.  In fact it was nearly undrinkable.The positives--the French toast decent.  The ""berry compote"" was  about 2-3 halved strawberries with a touch of a strawberry syrup.  The side of syrup was not so necessary, as the strawberry syrup was enough on its own.  Would have preferred a side of a few strawberries (a few blueberries would have been nice) and to have done my own syrup.Side of bacon came with 3 strips.  One strip, crisp perfection.  The other 2 strips an underdone fatty mess.Avocado toast was a very generous portion.  Eggs were scrambled right, with just mounds of Avocado.The restaurant as a whole seemed a touch understaffed.  Kudos to the managers wearing suits who stepped in to aid in clearing plates, setting tables and just kept the restaurant running.  Great to see that kind of hustle.Great to go in the summertime when there's no wait.  I imagine that the wait gets crazy late fall through early spring.  If the wait is 15 minutes or less go for it.Longer wait than that, you'd best take advantage of the Yelp waitlist feature.  Otherwise pass.",0
"I love this spot! The food is delicious and the ambiance is perfect. I love the tropical theme that they have going on. I came here on a Friday after work at around 6ish with some friends and it was actually a bit crowded. The bar stools were all taken and so were all of the tables. You sit yourself down and it's first come first serve. After waiting around and ordering drinks (their happy hour is amazing and it's until 7pm. I highly recommend their frozen margaritas) the table with the beach chairs opened up and my friends and I grabbed it right away. Tables started opening up later on in the night, so don't leave if you don't find one at first! Give it about 10-15 minutes. When you order they give you a cute bottle to put on the table so the waiters can find you. We shared guac and chips (love that you can customize toppings on the guac) and I had the chicken tacos which were so good. The service here is actually great and I love that the waiters kept checking on us to make sure we were okay and got everything we ordered. I think this will be my new favorite after work spot in midtown!",0
"I had a wonderful experience at Pho Saigon. The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was delicious. The appetizers, crab egg rolls in particular, were amazing. The pho tai (medium rare beef) was also very good - the broth was clear and the noodles were wide and plentiful. I didn't need to add any hoisin sauce, which was a bonus. The bathroom was clean, and I saw all young, handsome Viet guys working in the kitchen. Keep up the great work, Pho Saigon!",1
"I came to this restaurant with my bf and his sister for an early bday celebration and was impressed by the rave reviews. The morning of, everything went wrong, leading us to be 15-20 min late for our rsvp. We are normally never late for omakase rsvp, so this was a little confusing. One thing that felt a little patronizing was when we got there the waitress started clapping. This at first I was confused, but then just smiled and laughed the awkwardness away, since we were late and that was on us. We apologized to them and literally everyone in the restaurant since I though they all had to sit and wait for us. But it looked like everyone was already eating except for two other ladies- they probably had to wait for us, sorry! This already put me in a weird mood.

Once the sushi started coming out, I noticed how small the pieces were. Given the price tag, I kind of understood though. It was a good meal, but definitely not filing. They also give free ""happy water"" which was a nice touch. We told them it was my bf's birthday and they sang happy birthday and gave him a little pile of sashimi over rice which was",1
"I don't know why I keep hoping the food here will eventually be good...it never is. My last visit I tried the lasagna, yuck. It was bland, unseasoned, and tasteless. How do you go wrong on lasagna? Come on! The service, atmosphere, and food presentation are great. I really wish they would improve their food.",1
"Portions here are actually quite generous, and extremely filling! If you want to try their meringue dessert like we initially wanted to, definitely save some room and order accordingly. Between 2, we got the Blue shrimp aguachile, cucumber, Chilaquiles, queso fresco and Duck enmoladas, mole negro, creme fraiche.The blue shrimp is a light start to the meal, which I would highly recommend since the main dishes may err on the heavier side and hence, extremely filling. The duck enmoladas were so surprisingly delicious, it was just flavours that weren't expected, and everything was just so soft it melted away (in the best way!) with every bite. If I were to go back, I'd get this again and save space for the meringue...",0
Today was a very busy Sunday in the city as usual. Hard to find a great place for breakfast/brunch without a wait.  there was no wait around 10ish this  am. The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. They are located 1 block away from Madison square garden and penn station.  The diner is very large and can accommodate a lot of people. They are only allowed to serve alcoholic beverages after 11 am.  I waited for my mimosa and it was delicious.The food came by very quickly no more than a 15 minute wait.  The chocolate chip pancakes was DELICIOUS!'  The French toast could use a little bit more cinnamon but the food was delicious. This diner is open 24/7.  I would highly recommend this place during anytime in the busy city when you need some good food.,0
"I had a great time at Ukrainian East Village! The pierogis were so good, and I recommend the sauerkraut and mushroom ones. The latkas are also a great experience, and it's great to get applesauce on the side for them. The only downside was that the waitresses were a little absent-minded, and it took a while to get our check. But overall, I had a great time at this restaurant!",1
12/19/21 - update ordered from here again it seems like this places pizza ranking is dropping. The dough in my pizza was not fully cooked. It was really chewy and had a bitter like taste.On top of that sadly the dough also tasted low quality and almost like left over stale bread. It tasted like microwaved pizza dough quality Really disappointed because just a year ago this place was really good pizza. Perhaps it's just because of food inflation for why the ingredients have been slacking.,0
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. I ordered four different entrees, but only one of them was good. The rest of them were just okay. Nothing really stood out about the food. The only thing that made it worth it was the discounted Monday night special price.",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The food was really amazing and I'm really glad I came here. The wait staff was really friendly and helpful, and they were able to give us great recommendations with our order. I especially loved the brussels sprouts, the carrots and the kale salad, the Apple and gruyère toast (which the baby loved) and the pork Ragu, the octopus, and the cacio y pépé. I also tried the roasted pear for dessert. All of the dishes were really delicious and well-executed, with great flavors and complex preparations. I definitely recommend trying everything on the menu. I only had one complaint: the wait was a bit long, but it was worth it!",1
"Fantastic spot to have a meal and enjoy a well crafted cocktail near Madison Square Garden. Lots of great bites to pick from but make sure the wings with Fresno chili sauce, sriracha deviled eggs and fries & dips are on your list.  And save room for the cheeseburger which has nice patty flavor only enhanced by its special sauce.",0
The Lost Lady is a great bar with a great vibe. The only downside is that one of the waitresses moved a bunch of coats off of a stool and it made it difficult for me to find my jacket the next day.,1
I had a wonderful experience at Gyu-Kaku! The food was fantastic and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
I decided to come to this location out of the two ... because it was closer to where I was going later on but also because I'm a moon lover and they have a huge moon behind the bar where as the moon is located in the the dining area Luckily I came during happy hr .... and happy hr is EVERYDAY from 4-7!!! Awesomeness! This location was pretty nice ... inside was inviting ....I sat by the bar  ... but they have 2 levels for dining areas Staff was pretty nice and informative Drink was pretty good... I had the BEE LINE which included their house lavender infused vodka ...I also tried a few of the happy hr items ... the tiger roll and the soy and garlic korean wings which were pretty darn good I would like to come back and try their spicy pork or bulgogi They also have a wheel you can spin if you get an entree... it's too get a free item I'd come back  for sure,0
"Pleasantly surprised by the flavors in this mid-town spot. At 5:30 on a sunny Saturday evening the restaurant was only a third full, it's close by a number of broadway and off-broadway theaters, but didn't seem to get a large amount of the post-matinee crowd, perhaps bc it was the first nice weekend in a while. By 7:00 when we left it was about two-thirds full. Friendly and accommodating staff for our table of 4 + 1 toddler. Appetizers and ramen were served within a normal timeframe, fairly quick for the appetizers. We ordered:- Agedashi tofu: mm I liked the fried tofu ""skin"" it was slightly unctuous but light. Silky tofu paired well with chunks of tender eggplant. - Kara-age fried chicken pieces: Nice and crispy. Served hot out of the fryer. - Gyoza: pretty standard, good fry on the bottom for extra crispness on the skin. - Calamari-age: solid. - Nippori ramen: I enjoyed the coconut-soy based broth. My first time trying this type of flavoring served as ramen, their take was pretty good. - Garlic ramen: seasonal special of ramen tossed in a garlic sauce with corn, bamboo shoots, pork chashu pieces, soft-boiled seasoned egg. Delightful. Everyone's favorite of the meal. - Beef Gyuu ramen: shoyu broth with thinly sliced beef and onions, topped with green onions and ginger. Felt like something I could make at home. - Tan tan ramen: sesame infused broth is always tasty and fragrant. Took off one star bc all the ramen broths were all too salty. They could reduce the salt content by 1/3 and the flavors would still speak for themselves. Other than that would come back again for the ramen.",0
"The buckaroo burger at this restaurant was excellent! The mushrooms and bacon were cooked perfectly, and the cheddar cheese was melted perfectly. The bread was also fresh and warm. The vegan carrot cake was also very good. It was chilled, and the icing was delicious. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high. However, this restaurant is good for a special occasion.",1
"First time back here after some 13-14 years. Ordered the super nachos. Excellent choice, although I didn't care for the Tex-Mex chili (will swap it next time). The steak was really good. Salsa ranchera is also good. The cook (probably owner) is chinese.",0
"Valerie is a post-Broadway tradition for me --- phenomenal drinks, excellent food, and a convenient location for the post-theater crowd. I've stopped by on multiple occasions at this point, and I have never been disappointed. It definitely gets crowded, so I'd recommend a reservation, especially on the weekends. We were able to walk-in around 10 PM on a recent Tuesday and be seated without issue, but the restaurant was quite busy and service was a bit slow as a result.



Valerie is predominantly a gin bar, but their extensive cocktail menu features a variety of different liquors, so there's certainly something for everyone regardless of whether they like gin. Their menu lists the ingredients in each cocktail along with 2-3 adjectives to describe the overall flavor, which I found helpful as I sometimes struggle to envision how the flavors come together, especially with more unique ingredients. I landed on the Remember When, essentially a gin sour with a touch of floral, and I loved it enough to order a second drink. My fiance was feeling the fall vibes and ordered the Rather Proper (basically a Pimms Cup with a fall twist featuring apple and cardamom) and the Fabled Leaves (a whiskey drink with pumpkin,",1
"This restaurant is definitely a must-go for anyone looking for a delicious meal. The food is well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the drinks knock your socks off - especially during happy hour! The staff is super welcoming, and the waiters are more than happy to help you find whatever you need. Overall, a great experience all around. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try!",1
"Overall, I thought the Refinery Rooftop was a pretty fun spot to visit. The drinks were definitely on the expensive side, but I think that's to be expected in a high-end rooftop bar like this. The atmosphere was definitely lively and busy, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you're looking to try out this spot.",1
"The ceviche was a bit of a disappointment, while we did somewhat like the chicken satay. The lobster noodle is worth getting, even though I hoped for a somewhat larger portion for a dish that is labelled as ""large plate""",0
"Came here for dinner and had a good time although food was mediocre Pros:- If you have a party of two and don't want to wait forever to get dinner, eat at the bar! Honestly, more fun and entertaining. - Service was great, bartender/waiter was attentive. - Brisket was soft and tender.- Mac and Cheese was delicious. The serving size is definitely for two. - Like how it's a non-tipping place because they pay their employees more but we still tipped. Cons: - Pulled pork was extremely dry - had to drench it in BBQ sauce, which wasn't that great either. I come for BBQ for the pulled pork so was really disappointed.- Regretted getting the biscuits because they were not good, felt like they were frozen and then heated up .- Bathrooms were dirty, was actually shocked for such a nice restaurant.",0
"@lovebbqnyc with the HUGE ASS BULGOGI FRIES  double friedWho loves kbbq? ‍ Went to this spot as we heard the insane dj music outside (sound on)  To be fair we came here after roaming around in Korea town and there were loads of our usual spots that had a 45 min long waitWe were fairly surprised by this spot, with outdoor seating. We got the the love beef set with 5 sets of beef and all the apps: Tenderloin, brisket, ribeye, bulgogi, rib finger. It came with a sundubu (tofu soup)  then we ordered the bulgogi fries as extrasKey highlight I think was the bulgogi fries. Never seen before, double fried , crispy as hell with the right amount of toppings. I never thoughts I'd say this in a Korean barbecue spot. Those fries were literally the size of my head All in all a pretty decent place. I've had better BBQ but I'd rather eat than wait (it was already 8:30 at that time). Plus their service was pretty good.Another thing to note was that we ate outside. Hence we didn't have our own grills and they had to pre grill everything for us (nice in a way where we didn't need to do anything) but the meat was a bit dry.@midwestmunching",0
"I had a good experience at this restaurant today. I ordered a meal pal, and the oil spilled noodles were delicious. I also got a pork burger, and it was OK. I would have liked it to be a bit drier, but the sauce was good. The eggplant salad was also good, and I especially liked the garlic pieces in it. Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant, and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was mediocre at best. The pastrami I ordered was incredibly dry and flavorless, which was a huge disappointment. The decor is a bit outdated, though this doesn't ruin the experience. Overall, I'd say it's worth a visit if you're looking for a quick bite, but I wouldn't recommend staying for dinner.",1
"Los Tacos No. 1...that is saying a lot when a place claims to be Numero Uno. I've had this place bookmarked for some time. After having a huge meal at another restaurant, we hopped on over to this place. Yes we did. Pack it in babyyyy...this stomach has room for some more good eats.When I judge how good a taco is, it's all the components that come together and with that ONE SINGLE BITE, the flavors has to explode and dance in my mouth and make me want to take one bite after another.We ordered one of each. You get to choose corn or flour tortilla. Surprisingly, my fave was the Nopal (cactus). It has the texture of zucchini. The pork was quite salty but I enjoyed that two slivers of pineapple. The beef was flavorful but it didn't make me go slap the counter. The sauces didn't stand out to me, they were just sauces. Even though the tacos were made fresh and served hot, none of them really made me go HOLY MOLY, these are the BEST DANG TACOS in Manhattan!With that said, this chain has exploded in recent months with more locations throughout Manhattan. There are no table and chairs. You stand at the counters to devour your tacos and go. My current three favorite taco places is one near my home, Edison Tex Mex and two from SoCal. Funny enough, the owners are two guys from Mexico and California that wanted to bring authentic Mexican taco to the East Coast.Note: No Ticket, No Taco(s). This location is right next to Levain Bakery, best cookies in the world in my opinion. And that is how we ended our NYC foodie adventure that day. To walk off all the stuff we ate, we headed to Cha Cha Matcha that was a hop, skip away.",0
"I was a bit surprised by the good reviews for this restaurant, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I ordered the Caesar salad and pizza. The pizza crust was not what I was expecting, it was more like a thick pie crust. The sausage tasted strange, it was kind of bland. Overall, I wasn't too impressed.",1
"99 is always a go to for me whenever there's a birthday coming up. The birthday person gets their entire meal for free. Since this is all you can eat, everyone just has to split the bill evenly, making it super easy to go in large groups (just don't get extra drinks, save space for more food!)I love hot pot and I used to love 99's selection. They decreased their variety last year and took out a few things like the Chinese sausage. The broth selection is still great and I love the tomato one. My favorite meat to get is the fatty beef and thankfully this place is all you can eat because we never seem to get enough of it!The service here is okay, depending on how busy it gets. There is usually a crowd waiting to eat here almost every day for dinner. The wait can be pretty long if you have a large party and no reservation. Overall, a good place to go when you're hungry and not in a rush.",0
"Maya is definitely worth a visit for brunch! The tapas style menu allows for more customization than other restaurants, and the portions are definitely small but very tasty. The best dish of the brunch for me was the plantains - they were so good I could have eaten them all! The service was also really good, even though the restaurant was quite busy. The only downside was that the drinks took a while to come, but they were all really good. Overall, I highly recommend Maya for a fun and delicious brunch experience!",1
I have been to this bbqs a few times over the years.when ever me and my wife are in Manhattan around the time square area.this branch was pretty good they give you the same bbqs taste just like my favorite bbqs location in queens. Along with the some of the same deals also. This location is usually packed business is usually jumping in this spot .you have a lot of business people and tourists alike that were in attendance. It gives you the NYC vibe a little bit of a party kind of vibe. But in a good way .the food was good and the staff was pretty cool like at the rest of the locations that was cool. Rest rooms and the rest of the establishment seem pretty clean.The prices are about the same ..maybe just slightly higher because of being in Manhattan the city is always higher than the other boroughs  ..so I would definitely go back to this particular location in the future.,0
"The food at this restaurant is fairly mediocre, and the portions are a bit small. The roasted duck wonton soup was bland and lacked any flavor, and the duck had no crispy skin. The wonton fall apart easily, and the broth was too watery. The spicy beef chow fun had good spice flavor, but the beef was a bit tough and the noodles were overcooked. The portion was big, but it was also expensive. The only redeeming factor of this restaurant is that they accept cash only.",1
"I came to this restaurant on a beautiful sunny day after a run in CP and I was really disappointed. We were seated inside the outside establishment that was constructed and it felt like we were just forgotten by our waiter for most of our stay here. We tried the burger (which had weird tough parts inside the meat that crunched hard on my tooth) and it was definitely way undercooked. Furthermore, it looked like they just gave us few fries and the rest was just the bottom of the batch with a lot of crumbs. The only shining star was the croque monsieur, which was ham and cheese toast, but still super pricy for what we got ($20). We came at almost 2pm, and we were restricted to only the limited brunch menu, which was disappointing since we wanted to try the flatbread.",1
"I had a great experience at Uncle Boons! The menu has a lot of options and I was able to try out a few dishes. The roti kaeng fak tong was my favorite - it was extremely spicy, but it was delicious. The crab fried rice was also good. The only downside was that it wasn't my taste, but the service was good and the atmosphere was really cool. I would definitely come back!",1
"Bobwhite Counter serves up southern comfort food on Avenue C. indoor dining is still closed, but there is tables and chairs outside. the interior is set up for the ease of takeout orders to go smoothly. my favorite at Bobwhite's is the catfish sando, but i changed things up with dinner last weekend and went for the Chicken, Pickles, & Ranch Biscuit; Buffalo Biscuit; and an order of fries. i'll be honest with you the biscuit sandwiches are excellent. 1) Chicken, Pickles, & Ranch Biscuit is a biscuit stuffed with crunchy chicken tenders and thin sliced pickles. the ranch sauce drizzled in the sandwich ties together in a flaky soft biscuit. totally delicious. $5.192) Buffalo Biscuit is a Buffalo sauced chicken tender sandwich that is full of flavor and chicken in a biscuit. can't go wrong with sando if you are Buffalo sauce fan. $5.193) the fries were seasoned well but too way soft. no crispy crunch. the fries were still really warm, but they just lacked texture and were fairly mushy. the taters tasted fine with Heinz. $3.19staff had my order ready on-time and was packaged well. they were friendly and total pros with handling a constant flow of delivery people and hungry mobs. drop mic cuz i am just wingin' iti outzzz",0
"I had a great time at PMF Pardon My French! The atmosphere is really cozy and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the escargot, which were very flavorful. I also really enjoyed the steak au poivre, which was cooked to perfection. The side dish of Gratin Dauphinois was really cheesy and a lot of food, but it was really good. The service was great, and the staff was very attentive. I would definitely come back!",1
I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The food was strange and not very tasty. The service was also very poor. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1
"We came here on a slow Sunday evening. We had seen this place many times but just now decided to go in.We didn't make a reservation and was immediately seated. We ordered the pan fried pork dumplings, the pork soup dumplings, and a make our own dish with chicken and kung pao sauce. Everything came out in a very timely manner. Both of the dumplings were delicious and the soup dumplings were bursting with soup. Not my favorite flavors, but will do in a pinch. The chicken kung pao dish came with brown rice (a really nice surprise) and was well seasoned.The decor was great, there was a large space that opened up in the back where people could gather in larger groups. It was more upscale than my usual places and the prices reflected that. The staff was super helpful, very kind, and efficient. Overall, I would come back if I had the dumpling craving, given that boyfriend's apartment is right around the corner, but it wouldn't be my first choice for dumplings.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant and the arugula kabocha salad was definitely a standout dish. Unfortunately, I was not able to enjoy it due to the fact that it is not currently available to be delivered to me through seamless/grubhub. I walked 20 blocks to the restaurant to try this salad and it was definitely worth it. I would love to be able to have it delivered to my home so that I can continue to enjoy it.",1
"While visiting New York City for the first time ever my sister and I checked out The Liberty.This was one of my favorite places to go. Luckily we had seating facing the outside with the French doors opened up. Talk about a magical day!Our server Chris was very attentive to our needs and very friendly as well! She kept coming back to make sure our drinks stayed full including water. Plus she had an upbeat personality.The pizza - the New was the best I've ever eaten in my life, and the drink was very flavorful even with a flower in it!There was an International American Idol going on so a lot of spirit and energy filled the room! If I'm lucky enough to come to NYC soon, I'll make it a point to come back to The Liberty!",0
"Nice, high quality Soon Du Bu place in K Town. It gets quite crowded and you cannot make a reservation ahead of time, but the line moves pretty quickly and we (a table of 7) were seated within 10 minutes. I love the amount of starters they bring out for you to nibble on - they're all so flavorful and felt like they kept coming! We got the Kimchi pancakes to start which were pretty good but nothing to write home about. The Vegetable Tofu Soup, which I have gotten a couple of times here before, is so hearty and filling. Have the option of getting an egg cracked in it too if you'd like, but I opted not to do so. I really enjoy this place and it certainly a staple for a vegetarian!",0
Got mealpal from here + ordered some extra stuff for pick up.1/For meal pal today it was the oil spilled noodles and they were good I suck I didn't mix it well and so I got a reality kick towards the bottom when the spice drop kicked me in the face. But the noodles were very good2/ for my own order I got the pork burger + eggplant salad.1/ the pork burger was okie- i wish it was as dry I was there was more sauce2/ the eggplant salad was good I loved the pieces with garlic but I wish there was more of it becasue the sauce was a little watered down.,0
"First time trying Egyptian street foodI got the cheese hawawdhi Crispy thin bread with beef patty with cheese veges.And I really like the mint lemonade, so refreshing !",0
"Good pizza near grand central, always busy with people but the line moves quick and they have lots of options. They have tables but it's first come first serve so you might have to wait a while to sit down.",0
"I ordered take out from here and was disappointed with what I received. I ordered the Hokkien mee and the Nyonya seafood fried rice. The Hokkien mee was very liquidy and only had shrimp and some pieces of meat with some vegetables. Typically it should contain other seafood ingredients as well. The seafood fried rice had the option of rice that was made in chicken broth which I opted for. It added a nice, different taste but it was very soft in texture. It also included very few pieces of shrimp, squid and maybe some small sliced scallops but there really wasn't much in it besides rice. However, the prices are pretty good and they do give a lot! Maybe the other options on the menu are better and dining in might be better as well so give it a try.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The food was average and the service was nice, but I don't think I'll be back. The egg roll was the best part of the meal for me.",1
"Came here with Pulsd deal with one appetizer and two main ($20 each) and two drinks. Saturday lunch was empty. Apart from us there was another table at noon on a weekend. So service was fast. Most of the famous Sichuan dishes are 29.90 which is very expensive compare to the Sichuan restaurants nearby. So we ended up couldn't order the ones we wanted; I guess that what the deal I got so I have no complain. But for the price in this place I would not come back without any sort of discount. I saw they have $35 for $50 on yelp deal. Instead of giving discount why not just try to lower the price. The fish fillet in chili sauce is good spicy but nothing really special. Lamb with cumin also taste very decent.  The steam chicken with chili oil (口水鸡）doesn't taste like anywhere I had before, not spicy at all the with funky taste. Tan tan noodle was very disappointing, the noodles were cooked too long and was broken apart, despite not having enough sauce to mix it.",0
"I was excited to return to Mijita after it reopened after a long hiatus, but I was a little underwhelmed by the brunch. The portions were small, and the bill was not. The service and art were great, though. I especially love the football mural and the printing of the image on the toilet paper rolls. The downstairs bathroom feels like a vintage wine cellar too.",1
"I came to this restaurant after reading great reviews on Yelp, but my meal was just average. I ordered the breaded chicken with rice and fries. I was expecting the rice to be seasoned with other vegetables and sauce, but it was just plain rice. The fries were just fries. The chicken was good, but I found it a bit bland. I wanted to like my meal, but it was just okay. I would come back and try something else, but I was slightly disappointed by my meal. I also received the $4 sangria deal after checking in and that was the best part of my visit. The sangria was not too sweet and had a nice flavor of different fruits. I would have gotten another one but one drink was enough! Overall, I think this place is affordable given its location in New York City, but I would like to see more flavor to my meal.",1
"TLDR: really nice flavor combinations and lovely aesthetic. the absolute must gets here are two things: 1. the aged duck medallions: this was SUCH a unique flavor pairing that i was kind of surprised work, never did i think banana and duck and pesto would be a good combination but somehow they made it work and they made it work well 2. the buckwheat pastry/tart is SOOOOOOOO good...... this was possibly the best thing on the menu... tasted like a s'mores and tiramisu together and it was just heaven in a dessert",0
"The pizza was just ok.  I have had much better in NYC.  The crust was very thick at the edges and the cheese didn't start until 3 inches into the crust.  It was ok, but I wouldn't recommend.",0
"Terrible service, mediocre food, martini was in a small glass @ $14, food was very overpriced, and there was an additional $10 music charge downstairs that was not posted anywhere until the check came.",0
"I was really happy with my experience at Dos Caminos! The restaurant was very quiet and not at all busy, which made it easy to make reservations. The food was excellent and I especially enjoyed the shrimp fajitas. The only downside was that the empanadas were a bit different than I expected - they were more like plantain-filled with beans and cheese inside. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend Dos Caminos to others and would definitely return in the future.",1
"I live nearby and have been here 3 times (twice for brunch, once for dinner). I have yet to have a seamless experience, but food is pretty tasty. For dinner, I highly recommend the cauliflower entree. For brunch, I love the avocado dosa, the roasted beets, and wild mushrooms with poached eggs (I'm vegan and have not had the eggs but friends seem to like it). Getting to the service... everyone here is very nice but overall execution needs improvement. When I brought my husband here for his birthday dinner, they forgot to put a candle in his dessert (I had written this in the notes of the reservation and also called ahead to confirm). They were nice enough to comp us for the desserts. But come on.. this was a BASIC request that an abc restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter, should not have had difficultly to fulfill. When I  came here for the first time for brunch, they did not separate the poached eggs from the wild mushrooms as requested - this was pretty disappointing for a restaurant that specializes in catering to people with dietary restrictions. The second time I came from brunch, I ordered the same wild mushroom dish and it was half the size of what I ordered on my prior visit. Also, our food came out before our drinks arrived.",0
"The Lunch burger is a great option for lunch. The bacon and smoked mozzarella add a nice flavor and extra richness to the burger, but it's not necessary to order it. The burger was well seasoned and delicious without any of the extras. This place is definitely worth stopping in again.",1
Came here for dinner with one of my friends before going out for the night. First impression of this place was wow this is really tiny - like 7 tables tiny all super close to each other. No one checked my vaccination card. I got the margarita pizza which was ok. I think my pizza was a little too wet/soggy for my liking. Otherwise the service was friendly and quick.,0
"There are so many negative reviews about STK midtown that I felt compelled to share my experience. When you enter you will need to show your vaccination as with any restaurant in NY that you desire to sit indoors. I enjoyed the decor and dj that was playing. Just loud enough that you can still have a conversation. The service was prompt and the waiter was attentive, I didn't feel rushed or ignored. I started with the sea bass ceviche which was well prepared and for dinner had the sea bass with bok choy and the beef short ribs with a Mac and cheese side. The miso glaze on the sea bass complimented it well and it was perfectly prepared. The short ribs were well prepared as well and very tender. I'd pass on the Mac and cheese as it was dry and overcooked but that was the only item that we didn't enjoy. The waiter actually sang happy birthday to me and the chocolate moose crunch dessert they gave was fantastic. I'd definitely visit again and say they are worth a try.",0
"Overall, I wasn't too impressed with the food here. The rolls were average and the speciality rolls were way better than the regular rolls, but the sauces and toppings on the speciality rolls weren't that great. The up town hot girl roll was supposed to be spicy, but it was actually sweet. Overall, I would recommend avoiding this restaurant if you're looking for a good sushi experience.",1
"Unfortunately, my experience at PaPa Thai was not that great. For my to-go order, I selected the Beef Pad Thai, Chicken Noodle Soup, and Veggie Dumplings. Much to my surprise pretty much everything was inedible. Some issues with the items: the pad thai noodles were soggy as if they were microwaved and the beef was a bit rancid; the soup had a sour aftertaste; and the dumplings simply were gross. I called the restaurant to inform them about the quality of our food, but they were closed by the time we tried the food. Since I picked up the food near closing time, perhaps, that's a reason why the food was very subpar. Actually, no that does not make sense because the beef (and to some extent) tasted very old. In an effort not to get sick, we pretty much threw out the food after a couple of bites. Looking at some of the reviews, I guess my experience seems pretty on point (unfortunately) for this restaurant.",0
"This small restaurant felt like a small home built solely of wood. At first, it gave me a Japanese vibe, but then my cousin said it right. It felt like we were at Ikea, which made sense as this was a Scandinavian place!

We had the soju cocktails. They were reasonably priced and tasty. We loved our apps. We got the chicken pate that came with toasted rye and pickled squash. The combination of the chicken pate and pickled squash was delightful. The toasted rye was a little too oily. We also really liked the whitefish tostada. For our entrees, I got the green cous. It came with cous cous in a dill sauce with pickled carrots (yum!), sweet potatoes (delicious!) and beets (yum!). I felt that the cous cous needed a bit more salt. We also tried the meatball entre. It was very good! I would definitely get this again.

The hangover sandwich was great as well and so was the side of potato salad. We would've given this a 5 star, but we had mixed feelings about the danish hot dog. We felt that the bun was over buttered so it had a significant buttery",1
"Pretty tasty pizza, although expensive - specialty slices will run you about $6.I had one slice with bacon, mushrooms, and pepperoni, and also a margherita slice. They don't have tap water so I threw in a bottled water too, and it was about $16 for all that which I found pricey. Pizza is NY style pizza and was tasty, but could have been warmer. They're also very large, I probably would have been fine with only one slice. They were unfortunately out of garlic knots. They have a tiny bathroom for customers, in the basement.I'd probably seek out another pizza place next time but it was good at the time.",0
"Definitely one of the best place for dinner and drinks. I love the ambiance and music. The vibe was really nice for dates. The dim lights and music were perfect to have intimate conversations while having privacy from tables close by. The appetizer we got was the fried pickles, which were light and crispy. The only down side was that they didn't have enough for me to gobble up but....The entrees were HUGE. We got the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, honey chicken and shrimp grits! They were all delicious and filling. I loved the southern portions!Overall it was a great dinner.",0
"Overall, a nice stop before a show.Admittedly skeptical before heading into one of only a few Mexican restaurants in NYC, we were pleasantly surprised by this one. The drinks are strong, and the appetizers are great.The reason for 4/5 is the main entree. First, they only brought one order out which I chalk up to a bit of a language barrier, secondly the meat in their tacos is a little on the... ""gamey"" side, which is weird for beef. It was not terrible, but also not what we expected.Overall, it's a nice stop, just maybe avoid beef items or at least prepare for an atypical flavor.",0
"100% recommend this place. I honestly came across this place by chance on TikTok and I'm so glad I did! My Korean friend in high school would actually bring a vegetarian version of these to school with no specific topping, and I always loved it. When I saw the TikTok I was so excited because this was my chance to have it again. We went at around 11:30 on a Sunday, and there were only 2 other groups there. It's a small store and there's no room inside to eat. There is an outside seating area but there are only 2 small tables so not too much room. In terms of the food, I got the spicy mushroom and it was so delicious. I was doing a little food tour so that's why I only got 1, but if this is your whole meal you would definitely need to get 4-5. Honestly this place has more of a snack vibe, but it is very delicious. I believe the price per each comes out a little above 3.50 with tax. My friends loved the different flavors they got too. If there was any place on our tour we all wanted to come back to, it was this place.",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The drinks were great and the atmosphere was really cozy. I will definitely come back and try the tapas.,1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay. The carbonara was a bit light in flavor, and the pasta was a bit soft. The service was acceptable, and the bill came out to be $70+ post-tax pre-tip. I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",1
This place is great for a group. The servers are very attentive and the food is great. I highly recommend it!,1
"NY doesn't have as big as a taco/Mexican food scene as LA does. I think Los Tacos is the best as taco joints come by here in NYC. Usually when people ask me where to grab the best tacos place in the city, I direct them to Los Tacos. There is a line here no matter what time of day you come due to the popularity of this place and Chelsea Market in general. I would usually grab one of each taco offered on the menu (grilled steak, grilled chicken, marinated pork and grilled cactus) with a corn tortilla.  Each taco is overloaded with flavor and is extremely juicy. The meats are also marinated wonderfully and is full of spice if you order them with everything (onions, cilantro, guac and salsa.) Overall, I've been to Los Tacos countless times already and I keep finding myself back here whenever I'm Chelsea Market. The line may seem a bit intimidating at first, but rest assure it moves at a decently fast pace. Definitely add the roasted chili peppers provided at the condiments station if you're a big fan of spice!",0
"No longer sushi I loved. Sad to get smaller than a dime sized portion of avocado in my salmon avocado roll.  If I wanted only salmon, i could have gotten that for cheaper.  Literal pea size on the top side of the roll for appearances, there was none on the other end of the sushi...  I could not taste the avocado.  And sadly they did away with the best part of the salmon avocado roll which was the truffle oil avocado... it's just plain overpriced tasteless pea sized avocado. Extremely disappointed customer.",0
"A friend of mine told me that this was a NYC bucket list sort of place, and so we checked it out on a recent Friday night. Despite concerns that there would be a line out the door, it was actually pretty quiet. The line moves quick and the portion size is solid.  The pork-noodle combo that I got was essentially big chunks of pork and gi-normous strands of thick noodles. So much so that I had to use a knife to separate chunks of the noodles (I enjoyed this part).  I thought it was flavorful, and they have spicer options available. I'd go back for a quick bite or order take out for sure.",0
"This restaurant is great for a romantic night out! The food is amazing and the service is excellent. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit dark, so it can be difficult to take pictures. But overall, this is a great place to enjoy a night with someone special.",1
Very solid.  Was here for lunch and had the shrimp cocktail (good sized shrimp and nice presentation) and the bone in strip loin. Cooked to perfection and delicious. Excellent service as well. Definitely a split go to restaurant.,0
"I needed some French Toast before I left NY. This was the closest place to the hotel that I found. We were fortunate enough to be the last walk-in to immediately be seated. Everyone after us had to wait. The gentleman who greeted and sat us down was very hospitable. Definitely wasn't your typical diner for 2 main reasons. 1. The menu didn't have as much to choose from as your typical diner.  2. It was pricier than your typical diner. The bacon was good and you do get a nice sized portion. However, the French toast was just ok. I could've done without the pecans and I love French Toast. Too bad they don't have just plain French toast on the menu. Overall, it wasn't bad but I wouldn't return.",0
"I literally think about this kimbap constantly. It's so yummy, easy to grab for lunch - and the perfect portionThe spicy pork is so good that I keep ordering it and haven't had a chance yet to try other flavors! I need to try them all eventually....",0
"Awesum Dimsum is a decent place to go for vegan or vegetarian dim sum, but I would recommend going elsewhere if you're looking for an authentic dim sum experience. The dishes tasted mediocre, not terrible but not amazing. The prices are reasonable, but I think I would rather spend a bit more money at a more authentic dim sum spot.",1
"I came to this restaurant with a group of friends and we enjoyed the happy hour specials. I remember the cocktail had yuzu and sparkling wine in it and it was really refreshing. I also ordered the scallop roll and we shared the bbq cauliflower. Everything was really good and the restrooms were very clean. The scallop roll was really small, though, so it wasn't enough for me. But it was still really tasty. I would definitely come back and try the other specials.",1
"I've been a loyal customer of the Indian restaurant on E 4th St for years, and I have to say that their food is still the best in the East Village/LES area. Their delivery is quick, food is hot and fresh, and their deals on lunch boxes are unbeatable. I always call ahead of time for their chicken or lamb specials of the day for the lunch boxes - usually its chicken tikka masala or lamb curry. It comes with the main (chicken, lamb or 2 vegetarian mains), a vegetable dish of the day, lentils, rice, naan, papadum (thin crispy cracker) with a sweet red sauce and a green mint sauce, and their rice pudding as dessert.

I really appreciate the small business owners who are still putting in the hard work during these tough times. Keep up the good work, and I'm sure your customers will continue to support you.",1
I stopped by Seated for dinner tonight and was very pleased with the food and prices. I got two tacos and my friend got a quesadilla. Both were delicious and reasonably priced. I would definitely come back here if I'm in the area again.,1
"Really good overall. Everything was Super spicy but if you can handle it I would say go for it. Service was pretty great. Really expensive place but worth trying at least once. The cauliflower was really yummy but a bit dry, needed a dipping sauce. The cheese rolls were very flavorful and spicy. The lamp chops were delicious and cooked very well, the rice they serve it with was very interesting and also super flavorful. The butter chicken was my favorite, probably because it was the only thing that wasn't spicy. What I didn't like was that they don't serve rice with the butter chicken unless they just forgot go give us rice. The dish was 70% sauce and 30% chicken, why wouldn't you give rice? The drinks were really good too but also super expensive. I would recommend this place but I'm not sure I would come back. Too expensive and spicy for me.",0
Steak was excellent.  In our party everyone enjoyed their meal.  Sides were good.   Desserts were fine also.  Did not like policy of seating everyone at tables next to each other.   Service was good.,0
"Los Tacos No. 1 is a must-go restaurant in Times Square. The tacos are fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly and efficient. The only downside is that there is limited seating and it can get crowded, so be prepared to stand.",1
"The Times Square Diner was OK. The Cuban sandwich was different than any other I'd ever had, and there was sweet pulled pork on it which would have been good on its own, but odd in the Cubano. The French onion soup was really good and perfect on a cold night, and the food wasn't memorable. We ended up just tossing the leftovers the next day. It's one of the few places that has indoor dining in the area and open late, so it's an option if you want something other than fast food.",1
"We used Chowbus to order delivery from this Taiwanese spot. I dunno, maybe it was the 12 hours it took for delivery, but it was just OK to us. I think we might have to actually try to eat here to really experience the food.So maybe more to come on this one...",0
"The rating is based on the fact that it is a Taiwanese American restaurant, and therefore, I didn't knock out one more star for not being super authentic.  The flavoring reminded me a lot of Win Son in Brooklyn, where both places take a new spin on household snacks and dishes that all Taiwanese grow up knowing and loving.Dinner dishes that we would recommend are 1) Sausage party and 2) Crispy silken tofu as starters. Skip the oyster omelette, it was drenched in so much sauce that we can barely taste the omelette itself.For entrees, the two of us shared the Water spinach and shrimp paste and Hsinchu Mifen. Both reminded us of home!If you are in a mood for beer, try the mango flavored Taiwan beer. Brunch menu looks interesting, will return for that!",0
"I went to Bar Belly with coworkers for happy hour on a Friday night and it did not disappoint. We made a reservation and I would definitely recommend one because it was very busy and it's a pretty small venue. It's a narrow but long restaurant. We were a pretty big group of 6 people and despite our reservation we were initially seated at a 4 person table. It took a lot of convincing the hostess to move us to a larger table. We ultimately were moved after ordering 4 dozen oysters that didn't fit on our table. We picked bar belly for the $1 oyster happy hour and the oysters were amazing. Fresh and sizeable. We ordered 3 rounds of 4 dozen and it took about 20 minutes between each round to have the oysters shucked. The oysters were definitely the highlight of the night. The fries were also very good and had seafood seasoning that made them addictive and we ordered 3 rounds. The happy hour drink selection was basic and we opted to get their signature cocktails. Our group ended up trying at least one of each and they were all delicious. Burnt love, dead witch, invisible woman, knight rider were crowd favorites. I did order a mango #5 but something in it had a spoiled flavor I didn't like and the waiter was nice enough to switch it out for a different cocktail. We ordered the deviled eggs which were delicious and hit the spot when we started to get hungry. The charcuterie board was pretty standard and on the smaller side. Overall, you'll definitely see me back there for oysters.",0
"Average pizza. The pizza wasn't all that good, but at least it was cheap. You can get a good good combo special with two slices and a drink, and it'll hit the spot for pizza.",0
"Last minute change of plans led to a weekday lunch here, which I was not expecting. The place is well decorated and has a very rustic, cozy vibe despite its location in a very corporate midtown zone. Loved the brick wall interior as well as the fresh bouquet of flowers at the bar.Dined at the bar and had a salad (at a steakhouse, I know) and thought it was actually quite bland and dry. Obviously, not their forte but you'd think that a $45 salad would be at least better than something you can get at Whole Foods or some other salad shop. I can't speak for the menu bc I am biased just based on what I ordered but I will say that the place has a unique vibe-kind of serious but also not too serious. Hard to explain.I dont think Ill be returning but Im glad I tried it.",0
"In the spirit of showing a good friend from overseas the best of NYC's food scenes, I dragged her South East Asian spice loving face over to India Row. The block has definitely had some turnover in the last few years and the addition of Cinnamon Garden caught our eyes. Although the business was just starting to open for dinner, the friendly staff (perhaps owner) invited us to take a seat by the window and settle in while the kitchen got fired up. This was the first Indian restaurant I've been to where the Raita (not listed on the menu) is made the way aunties do in their homes - thick and sweet to offset the spice of the Chicken Tikka and Green chili Nilli Kababs. They don't need to draw you in with performers, crazy lights, or greeters offering free things. The food and service are enough.",0
"The best part is the shrimp with head-on! Oh yea! Gimme all you got! So ok, I went downtown to meet my old supervisor and a friend who worked at the same office many years ago (across from the World Trade Center). She gave me a few suggestions and we picked this one. The manager (or he could be the owner) was a friendly gentleman who likes to joke, also a nice fellow.Juliana was our waitress. She's friendly and attentive. We ordered calamari to share. The calamari app includes some fish. Then I had the black linguini with shrimp. My friend had salmon special and that looked super neat and fresh. My dish was unbelievable! The shrimp came with the heads on. I'm glad they didn't cut the head because I like the head. Did I mention that I eat fish head a lot too? Most people want to know the secret of my good memory. Fish head! That's the answer! You'll be thanking me for the rest of your life for making you remember everything that you try to forget! My pasta was delicious, I won't forget that. The sauce was very good. My friend liked her salmon dish. She said she's been here before and liked the food the last time she was here too. Good to know they're consistent. We both finished our meals. The restaurant's pretty big with a high ceiling and we sat by the booth. I got a pretty good view of the whole restaurant. I definitely enjoyed dining here. I hope you do too!",0
"I absolutely loved BCD Tofu! The wait time was nonexistent and the food was absolutely delicious. The tofu kimchi soup was my favorite dish and it was definitely a hearty meal. I also tried the Korean rice punch and it was really interesting. It comes in a small can and you need to use a straw to drink it, but it's definitely worth it. Overall, I would definitely recommend BCD Tofu to anyone looking for a delicious and quick meal.",1
Fire black bean burger. Lots of vegan and gluten free option. Tasty. Black Bean Burger,0
"My go to order of a Caesar Salad and Shroomtown personal pie is on point as always. Every location delivers the same consistency in quality, ambiance, and service - it's really incredible how they've managed to do this. Music was perfect for an early weekend lunch: Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Elton John, Eagles, Beatles. Only gripe is there's only one bathroom for the entire restaurant, so even with only three other tables full a line formed quickly.",0
"I love Franchia!! They are worth a stop on the NYC vegan eating trail. They are the slightly more moderately priced version of HanGawi, their sister vegan Korean restaurant. Franchia's prices are still not exactly cheap, as $20 seems a little high for a plate of vegetables and rice, but the food is really outstanding. My favorite dish so far has been the braised tofu with kabocha and eggplant: really well-seasoned veggies and tofu. The bibimbap is delicious, especially in the hot stone bowl. The spicy Korean chili tofu is really tasty: crisp tofu cubes in a savory garlicky sauce. The spicy Franchia noodles are good. The pumpkin noodle salad is great (light and refreshing). The shiitake mushroom ""bulgogi"" was good but not amazing. They also have a selection of vegan sushi; the only one I've tried is the spicy tuna roll which was good but did not hold a candle to the sushi at Planta Queen. Their desserts and drinks do not impress as much as their actual food. The tiramisu came in a ridiculously tiny portion and was topped with stale rice crispies. The soy cheesecake was decent. The mindfulness cocktail (makgeolli with orange) and the reincarnation cocktail (soju with Asian pear) were pretty forgettable.Lastly - don't forget that they have a solid lunch special: $15 for an entree plus a soup or salad.",0
Had lunch at Moustache last Friday...here are my thoughts:Service was very friendly and food came out quickly.Ambiance - we sat outside and it was the most perfect day. The inside of the restaurant is a bit dark and very casual. Food is good overall. We ordered a bunch of things and shared them. The highlight for me was the moussaka but everyone else loved the chicken kabob more. Pita bread was average and I thought it was kind of weird that it wasn't complimentary.Prices are a bit high considering the quantity but I guess that's due to the area. We'd return for sure.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant again this past Easter, but I was a bit disappointed with the service. I made my reservation through Yelp and the notification said that all reservations through Yelp would be outside. Given that day was a bit chilly, I called the restaurant to see if I'd be able to switch my reservation to be seated indoors. The person that picked up the phone assured me it would be no problem and that my reservation was actually inside anyway. I get to the restaurant and I'm greeted by who I'm assuming is the manager, and he starts to walk my group to the seating outside. I stopped him and let him know that I had spoken to someone and they assured me that I was being sat inside. He looked at me very confused and said there were no seats and that he would go talk to the woman I spoke to. He comes back to tell me that the hostess claims she never spoke to anyone and never said I was being sat inside????? Safe to say I was pretty annoyed that this person literally lied about speaking to me on the phone but the manager honestly handled it like a champ, suddenly finding my party a table inside. The restaurant clearly can't function when things get too busy because there was also a celebrity there eating with",1
"Wow soooooo good. I've never eaten cooked salmon, but wanted to start to incorporate it into my diet. I ordered the salmon pan and it was perfect. The salmon isn't fishy at all it was seasoned well, the only thing is that it was a very small piece. I ordered it with quinoa and salad and everything was so good. I'm so happy I found this new spot that has all these healthy tasteful options.",0
"Hilltop is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere. The service was a bit slow last night, but that didn't ruin the experience. The burgers and chicken were both delicious. The fries were also great. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"I had a great time visiting Shroomtown this past weekend. The Caesar Salad and Shroomtown personal pie were both fantastic. The only downside was that there was only one bathroom for the entire restaurant, so it became quite crowded quickly. The music was perfect for an early weekend lunch - Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Elton John, Eagles, Beatles. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! Everything we tried was really good, especially the popcorn chicken and shrimp pancake. The pork vermicelli bowl was also really good, and I especially loved the pork belly. I didn't enjoy the pork clay pot as much as the others, but it was still a good meal. The only thing I didn't like was the kimchi, it was a little too spicy for my taste. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
The people are friendly and so nice.  Really try and please the customer.   Interior is beautiful and full of lights and lanterns.  The food had traditional and fusion dishes.  While it was decent food it was not worth the price.  The enchiladas red chili sauces was really good.  Chicken taquitos were decent with moist chicken.  The blue card avocado salad lack crab and flavor.I would stick to drinks and appetizers.,0
Been here a few times and originally really liked the spot and set up. The last visit was pretty bad cause they mandated a food order for every two people. Wouldn't mind ordering food if it was good but the menu is lacking.  Also seems pretty excessive to mandate an item for every two people. We had five people with us so we had to get three bad items which basically went untouched.,0
"Ehh this was just ok. The menu was super limited so del friscos forced my hand and made me commit the cardinal sin of ordering a $20 beyond burger at a steakhouse. I been to the regular location a few times and enjoyed my meal there. But here, the menu is smaller the portions are smaller and the flavor was very non existent. My beyond burger was alright I had better impossible/ beyond meat burgers for less than that. The salmon in my Caesar salad tasted as if it was just cooked not seasoned. The best part about my meal was the fries and my cocktails, which I had about 6 and left completely sober. Service was cool but this ain't it!!",0
I got the chicken gaucho. The chicken was dried out and they KILLED the salad with onions. Blech. I'll pass. I'm not coming here again.,0
"Brunched here over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised! I was in a party of 8 and we had made a reservation weeks prior. That being said, we were pretty disturbed that we had to wait until 40 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. Aside from that initial impression, the place was nice, people were friendly, and the food didn't disappoint ... at least mine didn't. I ordered the Ricardo Special Breakfast and it certainly was special. All components of the plate were well seasoned, purposeful and harmonious. The skirt steak was especially delicious and in unison with the perfect amount of chorizo. The sides of rice and beans, sweet plantain, avocado and a fried egg were a perfect supporting cast. On another note, some friends ordered the chicken and pancakes and were disappointed by what resembled microwaveable pancakes that taste like chalk. Other than this, we had a grand time!",0
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this place, given that they charge about twice the price or other steamed rice roll places in flushing and sunset park.  But I left extremely impressed.  Generous portion, a lot of nice sized shrimp extremely fresh rice roll, pleasant service, and nice atmosphere.  Overall worth it, and delicious.  I'd recommend to anyone.",0
"Although the food was good, I had an absolutely horrible experience at this restaurant on Saturday night. The service was incredibly slow and the food took forever to come out. All of the entrees were not out at once, which made it difficult to order. The drinks were ordered in the beginning and we didn't get them until midway through the meal. I was really annoyed by how long it all took and by the time the food arrived I was full. I asked the waiter for a to-go box and he said no, they don't offer them here. Later on we asked another waiter and got a to-go box, but it was weird. The food was good, but the service was terrible and it was a really unpleasant experience.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at Terakawa Ramen. Located near Lincoln Square, the food here is admittedly affordable, but it's not particularly good. The noodles are fine, but the soup is bland and the side dishes are unremarkable. The wait can be a bit long, but that's probably because there's not a lot of space here. The only real selling point of this place is the fact that it's cash only, which is a bit of a downside. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"I ordered my lunch and I didn't receive any confirmation email. I called them to ask about it. The person who took my phone call spoke very limited English and it was hard to communicate. Someone who speaks English finally came and said they didn't receive my order. After 20 minutes, they finally received my order. It was a bit annoying. After my order was confirmed, it took over 1 hour to get my food (my office is very close to them). The Pad Thai was average. Nothing special. The portion was huge. I wish they could send me a notification so I know my order was received. Some places have been closed due to the pandemic but sometimes they still receive the order. Because of my previous experience, I thought they might be closed. But I figured out they are open by calling them. Not convenient at all. The food was just okay, the delivery was pretty slow and the ordering process was extremely inconvenient. I don't think I will choose this place again.",0
"I had a great time at Full Tank Moto Cafe! The space is very chill and relaxed, and the coffee is really good. The layout is really nice, with lots of open space to sit and enjoy a sandwich or latte with oat milk. I would definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a relaxing place to eat.",1
"Cute, uncrowded restaurant that can accommodate large parties. Our server was super friendly and attentive. They have a great happy hour that ends at 7. The menu changes seasonally. I had the brisket which was good but a bit salty. I would like to see a bit more variety on the menu- especially wanted to try the squid ink pasta I saw in a photo. However, I would definitely come back for the hh or to try new offerings on the menu.",0
"I visited this restaurant recently and it was very crowded! However, the wait was worth it because everything we had was delicious. The croissant was my favorite, with the scrambled eggs being a close second. The bacon was also very crispy and delicious. The only downside was that the new waiter who replaced Anthony was not very friendly. He didn't seem to care about our meal and wasn't interested in making conversation. However, the food was so good that it didn't bother me too much. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Went twice and the first time it was impressive, the second time 2 of my dishes were overcooked.I would definitely recommend the octopus, the cauliflower and the sweetbreads.The food is flavorful and the vibe really chill.",0
"Overall, I thought the food at this restaurant was mediocre. The bbq skewered chicken was undercooked, and the pork in the spicy pork over rice had a an unpleasant odor. However, the service was great and the atmosphere was cozy and decorated with white christmas lights.",1
"I was so pleasantly surprised when I visited this restaurant! It's a very intimate space that's perfect for date night. The wine was good - albeit not amazing, but I should have trusted my gut and gone with the one I was more interested in. The food was excellent though. They had a fair number of gluten free options and they were all tasty. We liked it so much we got a gift certificate for others to try!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere was really nice and the food was amazing. I especially loved the toro tartare and the tomahawk. The servers were also really nice and helpful. The only downside was that the maitre d wasn't my favorite. But overall, I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
Pros:-Multiple vegan options (savory and sweet)-Love the brown rice since its healthier than white rice-Fresh and good quality chutney-Vegan chicken curry bowl is delicious and perfect for one with leftovers or 2 to share-Perfect balance and ratio of cucumber salad to brown rice and vegan chicken curry in the bowl-Potatoes in bowl cooked perfectly-Food is ready quicklyCons:-I wish they sold full bottles of the chutney,0
"Our friends invited us to join them at Belle Harlem and we feel so privileged to have experienced this intimate dinner.  The restaurant is run by a husband and wife duo who do everything - host, cook, serve, clean, etc.  Chef Darryl previously cooked at several of the top restaurants in the city before opening his own.It's clear they enjoy what they do and take immense pride in their restaurant.  They serve a tasting menu usually at a twelve-seat communal table but are currently serving on their patio.  The dishes were thoughtfully composed and filled with care rarely seen in most restaurants.  Each night is different as the chef cooks whatever he feels like.One standout dish was a seared scallop and langoustine topped by a truffle-infused butter sauce and caviar.Insider's Tip: They are opening a coffee shop and bakery next week.  Meantime, book your tasting experience on Resy ASAP!",0
"It was okay.Came here the other night for a friends birthday celebration. My friend and I split the Harvest salad and the truffle moneybags pasta.They gave us complimentary bread and hummus-like spreads to start, which were okay.The salad was good, but the pasta was just okay. The sauce was soupy and the pasta was a little over cooked. I tried a bite of the Crustacean pasta and wasn't impressed either. The sauce was very strong in seafood flavor, but overwhelmingly sweet? The noodles were also over cooked.",0
"Overall, I thought the XLB here was pretty good. The soup was a tad too watery, but the dumplings themselves were quite good. However, I think they could use a stronger wrapper to prevent the dumplings from ripping. All in all, it was a pretty decent experience, and I would recommend Noodle Village to others looking for a good XLB meal.",1
"We were really happy with our meal at this restaurant. The food was delicious and had a really authentic Greek taste to it. The chicken kebab and the lamb chops were both really good, and the chicken was really tender. Our waiter was really friendly and accommodating, and the atmosphere was really friendly and casual. Overall, we really enjoyed our visit.",1
"I love Sathi Indian restaurant! I've been coming here whenever I crave for Indian cuisine, and I've also given them 5 stars on my very first review. Yesterday's Kheer, however, was a big let down. Upon removing the cover the sour smell just lingered. Fortunately, I ordered 2 and the other one was edible. But this shouldn't happen again especially when it wasn't too busy yesterday when I picked up my order. Triple check of your products doesn't hurt especially when it's summer and food easily get spoiled when not stored properly.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was super friendly and the food was great. I had a ramen bowl and it was really delicious. I would definitely come back!,1
"If it is not obvious by now, my favorite fried chicken is most definitely delicious, perfectly crunchy, light crisp Korean Fried Chicken.I am so delighted to discover Koko in the East Village. They are also on the Upper Westside. We ordered the drums, half spicy & half soy garlic. Both were very, very good and hit the spot, with sides of kimchi and radish to compliment the spice factor and crunchy chicken.Very friendly staff, owner.  Cozy minimal decor with cute chicken posters on the walls, plus good music playing in the background.Koko is known for being the ""Best Korean Fried Chicken with Soul"" and I agree. Koko also serves Bulgogi Bibimbap, Seafood pancakes, Gun Mandu (Dumplings), Parmesan Fries, Sweet potato fries, Crispy Garlic fries, Soon Tofu Udon, etc amongst other things which we've yet to try. Yes, of course, I will be back. Yum! **  delivery + take-out available *****Open Tuesday - Thursday 12:30 - 10:30, Friday - Saturday 12:30 until  11pm,  Sunday until 10pm, Closed on Mondays ******Various Soju, Beers, and soft drinks available ***",0
"I had a great experience at Barn Joo! The atmosphere was cozy and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The Bee Line drink on their cocktail menu was delicious - trust me, I tried them all! The appetizers were also very good, especially the bacon wrapped dates. The main course I had was the chicken curry and it was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was that the portion size was a little small for my taste, but that's really just a personal preference. Overall, I would definitely recommend Barn Joo to anyone looking for a great restaurant in the Union Square area.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The steak frites were delicious, and the portion was generous. The bearnaise sauce was a great addition, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The only downside was that the soup was a little watery. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"TLDR the food is authentic and they have great options for frozen orders of their menu items! This review is for a delivery order during the pandemic. So glad to have discovered this place and amazing that they opened during COVID times.My boyfriend and I got the westlake soup, Shanghai style noodles, green beans, and sliced beef and tripe in chili oil. Everything was really good! It was a great taste of childhood for some good Chinese cooking. The Shanghai style noodles were the favorite. Really good quality noodles and flavor. The sliced beef and triple in chili oil was really spicy, just how I like it! We even got a few frozen orders since they had such good variety in what you could order! Specifically we got the Xiao long bao, pork pan fried buns, and pork and sticky rice siu mai. It's so great and smart they offer such good choices for frozen food. Can't wait to try it just in time for the Lunar New Year and also to keep ordering from a new, local favorite.",0
My friends and I were looking for a bar to hang out at and they were gracious enough to take us in even though they were just an hour out from closing. Staff is super friendly and welcoming. They are doing indoor dining and practicing proper COVID protocols. The interior is beautiful and the ambiance is great if you want some place more mellow and less crowded but want somewhere to sit and chat with friends over a few drinks. I enjoyed the dirty 6 (one of their more popular drinks) and the earl of grey was surprisingly good too! Will definitely be back to try their food,0
Picked up food from this restaurant. I was a bit hesitant to order food from here based on the slightly negative reviews I had read. I ordered the samosa chaat and butter chicken. Samosa chaat was quite tasty and flavorful but the portion was tiny compared to what I had seen on reviews. Butter chicken... was not good at all. There was barely any seasoning. This is shocking since I'd read that this restaurant has a Michelin star chef? It was so bland that I had to add more coconut milk and seasoning myself.... very disappointed. Will be looking for a different Indian restaurant in the area :(,0
"Very good delivery and great value on the lunch special ($9.99). Yummy chicken and broccoli served with rice and two rolls. Arrived early, hot, and a generous portion.",0
"Overall, our experience at this restaurant was pretty good. The calamari was disappointing though, and the sautéed vegetable wasn't really my cup of tea. The beef chow fun was really good though, and I really enjoyed the pork chops Peking style. I think it's worth coming here for that dish, but I don't think it's a reason to come here overall.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but the portions were small so be careful with how much you order. The soup and meat were both really good and I really liked the marinade. However, I was really annoyed by the guy who handed me my food. He essentially pushed the open sharpie he was holding onto my hand, which was really unprofessional.",1
"Decent sushi! I ordered takeout and got the 3 maki lunch special which comes with miso soup and a salad. Considering the price, I thought everything was very reasonable. Was it the best sushi I've ever had? No. But it got the job done! Rating: 3.5 Stars",0
"The Chelsea Bell is a great addition to the NYC restaurant scene. The indoor seating is a great way to enjoy a meal in the city. The food is also delicious and reasonably priced. The only downside is that the customer service is still not up to par. But, with time, it seems to be improving.",1
"This place was a solid little restaurant. We would definitely pass on the Brussels sprout appetizer as it was steamed a bit too much and just tasted like the olives it cooked in. But the falafel sandwich in a pita was very tasty, with fresh veggies and fries. The hummus and falafel plate was also nice. Their hummus was smooth and flavorful (which I suppose it should be as the restaurant is named ""The Hummus Place."" Their homemade lemonade comes with a sprig of lemonade and is delicious! Not too sweet or tart. We will order a carafe next time!",0
"I love Chow House! I came here with my boyfriend after watching a show at the Comedy Cellar on a Friday night and was not disappointed!First, don't forget to check-in (via Yelp) to get your free glass of wine! For appetizers we chose to split the Dan Dan Noodles - which was so good! We were hungry and devoured this within seconds. For entrees, we ordered the Chili Fish and Sautéed Snow Pea Shoots with Garlic. The chili fish was slightly on the sweeter-side, but definitely had a nice kick with spice and was really good! Was a little surprised by the sweetness of it, so I probably wouldn't re-order, but it still was really good and I'm glad we were able to try it. The sautéed snow pea shoots was heavenly - the vegetables were so buttery and tasty. This was gone with seconds.Definitely recommend this place - will be coming back to try more food off their menu!",0
"Finally a place in Fidi that is open past 10pm!! I think hours on here are wrong -- we asked a worker and he said they close at 4am. This place is the perfect drunk finance bros dream with a ""conveniently"" located cheap drunk food after a horrible tinder date pick me up type of place. Great thing about this location is that its not super busy (as of yet) and has seating still! I can imagine it will start to get busier at night since there's literally nothing else open at night. I recommend getting the supreme pizza. I got the white pizza and I'd pass. EATING THIS PIZZA HOT IS MAJOR !! Cold and it's gross. I hope all you finance bros are happy, your dreams have been answered. Happily chow down on some pizza while cozying up with your Patagonia",1
"I wouldn't recommend this place. My family was looking for a restaurant in the area - and we were craving Mexican food. So, we came here. The service was super slow. The guacamole was very bland. After our waiter took our order we didn't see him again.My enchiladas were okay. Not the best ones I've had. But the rest of my family didn't like their meals - and we couldn't even complain because our server never returned to our table.I wouldn't recommend this place because of the poor service.",0
"Overall, Joe's Shanghai had decent variety and quality of food. It's no a mind-blowing place, and may not have lived up to its hype, however. The XLBs were delicious, and the braised duck was phenomenal.",1
"Walked in with a party of 2 on a Friday night at 8pm with no reservation and was able to get seated right away. It's a small restaurant with small tables but has both indoor and covered outdoor dining. Enjoyed the calamari as it was very light and came with zucchini, which was a nice touch. There are fresh homemade pasta options available, all of which were delicious. We had the pappardelle with spicy tomato sauce and the fettuccine with mushrooms, both of which were great. Also enjoyed a glass of Sancerre.Overall, cute little restaurant with great food and service. Will definitely return!",0
"Just ordered lunch from this place on seamless and it was pretty good. I choose the Hot and Spicy Beef Lunch Special which came with an egg roll. The spice wasn't over bearing I thought it was seasoned nicely. I choose the pork friend rice which was made the way I like it. (Some places make it terrible, this place got it right.) The portion was perfect for lunch, I really like this place.",0
"I absolutely loved Thai Son! The food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were very reasonable. I especially loved the shrimp fried rice. It was so flavourful and I could not stop eating it. The only downside was that the restaurant was very busy and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.",1
"Great service, nice ambience and tasty food. I had a fish taco. While I've had better fish tacos elsewhere and mine needed a pinch of salt, I was satisfied. My husband had the Queso Fundito with chorizo which was really delicious. Guacamole was fresh and delicious too. I've been to the Talaoche downtown. So I'm basing my stats on my experience there and this location. I would recommend Taloache for solid, tasty Mexican food. While I didn't imbibe because we were headed for a show, the cocktails looked excellent. Lovely place in the theater district that you really can't go wrong here if you're in the mood for Mexican. I also love the ability to make reservations through Yelp.",0
"Came in for a holiday team lunch with a 12:30 reservation for 9 people. The place was pretty empty. We started off with a few apps - calamari and some burrata. Both were good - no complaints there. For my entree, I went with the Mixed Grill Kebab (skewers of chicken, beef and kofta grilled with peppers, mushrooms and onions, served with rice). The chicken looked like it was going to be dry, but it was perfectly cooked. The beef was cooked to a medium rare (perfect for me). The kofta was a bit undercooked, which I didn't notice until I ate a few pieces. But I didn't get sick from it, so that's a good sign. They give a lot of meat, and a good amount of rice. It doesn't come with a salad like the menu said, but it's definitely enough food anyway.I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their other dishes. Maybe in the spring or summertime, once their outdoor seating is available - since it's right by the water.",0
"I stopped by Taco Dumbo on my way back to New Jersey from Virginia and I was pleasantly surprised! The rotisserie chicken tinga and beef short rib tacos were both delicious, and the price was reasonable. The service was friendly and quick, and the restaurant is located in a food court next to MSG, which makes it convenient if you're going to any events at the venue. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Taco Dumbo!",1
"I want to give 3.5 stars if that was an option. The experience started out great, walking in for brunch with pleasant live music in the front. I came with a decent sized party and sat in one of the rooms. We started with the free corn bread which was delightful, oozing with maple syrup  This place is definitely expensive, with a bottle of champagne for mimosas coming to 38 (no bottomless). So I ordered the corn flake French toast, which had a great presentation, but lacked in substance. The dish was very heavy, as I probably should have expected. The interior was hot, the whipped cream thick, but what stole the show was the caramelized bananas. The corn flake exterior just didn't work for some reason. My friends loved their meal and I wish I got something else, as I can just tell this place has a lot to offer. The service was normal, and the atmosphere was adorable, but also spacious. I loved the upscale farm theme throughout.",0
"The Brooklyn blackout was disappointing. The milkshake was average and the burger looked good, but I will not be returning.",1
"I had a good experience at Westville until I got an unknown meat burger, which was supposed to be a rare tuna burger. I asked the waitress if this was a tuna burger at all. She was so sure that it was well done. However, I know how tuna supposed to be tasted like and this was not a tuna burger at all. I thought it was more like turkey or pork. The manager came over and offered me another burger. Instead I asked for some discount to the bill, which did happen. Overall, the food was good, but the service could use some improvement.",1
Cool space.Energetic vibe.Trendy & classyGood & expensive Italian-American food.Great & expensive cocktails.Loved their complimentary bread.Your typical high-end NYC spot.,0
"Overall underwhelming compared to Yoon Haeundae Galbi. The food was decent and meat quality good, but you get way more for your money at Yoon's with comparable enough quality meat. Service at Yoon's was also much more attentive.Would try Rib No 7 mainly if you're looking for very upscale vibes, but there are other better options in NYC.",0
"Jacob's Pickles is definitely one of my favorite restaurants! The ambiance is perfect for dates, with dim lights and music that creates a nice vibe. The appetizers we got were the fried pickles, which were delicious and crispy. The only downside was that we didn't get enough of them! The entrees were also huge, and we got the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, honey chicken, and shrimp grits. All of them were delicious and filling. I especially loved the southern portions of the dishes! Overall, I would highly recommend Jacob's Pickles to anyone looking for a great dinner experience.",1
"I finally ventured out to Harlem after several trips to NYC, and I was so happy that I did! Definitely got to see another side of Manhattan, and experience Soul food in the big Apple city as a Southern boy.We were glad to have been able to reserve a table at Melba's for brunch on the day of! The server and hostess were just very nice and welcoming, just like what you'd experience in the South.For food, we ordered the Crab cake as our server recommended it as one of the bestsellers. However, I had to disagree, maybe because I am very particular and had my best crab cake version that I like imprinted in my mind already. But my SO did not like the crab cake here either. We could see the crab, but we felt it was more of a Tuna cake feel instead. For entrees, I had the Fried chicken and Eggnog waffle - and it was DA BOMB! The chicken was crispy and piping hot, and the waffle had a crispy touch as well. Well done! My SO had the Fried chicken and collard greens as his sides. He was disappointed that his chicken was not crispy/crunchy at all (which was shocking since mine was!). The collard greens was on the sweeter seasoning, which he did not like but I LOVED - so just be aware.For drinks, I had the Sangria, which was definitely too sweet for me, and my SO had the lemonade. Tl;dr: Overall, I really enjoyed the hospitality and the Fried chicken & waffle dish. I do feel overwhelmed by the sugar level of the drink and food by the end though.",0
"I really enjoy Indian Project - it's a great option for Indian food in the midtown west area. The decor is really cute (lots of painted elephants, etc.), and the vibe is definitely clubby (I wouldn't describe it as wholesome, but it's not my first choice to take my parents to). The food is solid - I got the veg korma and thought it was really good. The service is fine (a little slow), but the servers themselves are really sweet. I'm definitely interested in trying a few other Indian restaurants in the area, but I would be equally happy to come back here and make it my weekly spot.",1
"Angelo's Pizza is a great Italian restaurant with amazing outdoor seating. I've passed by this place a ton of times and every time I passed by, the outdoor seating reminded me of Italy and enticed me to try this place. However, I was hesitant to try this location at first due to some of the reviews. I tried their 7th Avenue location first, but I personally liked this location a lot better. The food we ordered was amazing. Starting from the perfectly fried Calamari and octopus to the delicious dipping marinara sauce to our pastas. We ordered the linguine con pescatore which is a seafood linguine in their home made tomato sauce and the rigatoni alla vodka. Both were spectacular. The sauce was good everything and made every dish better! Service was a bit underwhelming, but that didn't ruin the experience. Overall, great ambience, good food, and great location. I'll definitely one back!",1
"I had a decent meal at San Blas, and the prices are good too. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I like the option to mix & match the tacos, and I hope they expand their menu to also include some inventive items in the future.",1
"Not my cup of tea. Went in on a Saturday. The place smelled very good. However, even upon seeing my food, I was disappointed. The presentation of the yakisoba was underwhelming. I got the sweet beef yakisoba and chicken Takoyaki and both fell flat for me. I didn't finish either. The over cooked, mushy texture tasted very cheap to me. Won't be coming back. The ratings were so high, which is what brought me in. I was very disappointed in my food. The customer service was good. But that couldn't save my experience here. Wasted about 20 bucks on the these two items.",0
"Came here on Tuesday night at 7pm and our party of 4 were seated immediately. I got their pork set ($19) which consists of pork curry rice, pork cutlet, and diet-coke. I'm extremely glad that I got their Level 1 spice level--there was still a little kick to it but it wasn't to the point it was unbearable. My friends got Level 2 and Level 3 and it was just way too spicy. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who's craving warm curry especially on a cold NYC day. Solid meal with generous portions, affordable, attentive service, and amazing food.",0
"I was in the neighborhood and was in the mood for ramen so I decided to stop by this place. The place itself was relatively empty when I came here on a Thursday afternoon - there were plenty of empty seats and the place itself was very clean and the server was very friendly. We decided to start with the pork jowl buns which were absolutely delicious - I would highly recommend getting this. The meat itself was super tender and the bun itself was soft and the flavors went so well together. I was however disappointed by the ramen. The Tonkotsu Ramen was definitely flavorful but way too strong - instead of tasting fully the flavor it just tasted extremely salty. The noodles itself was good but the strong flavor of the soup was just too much for me. The Yaki Ramen itself had the same problem - it was way too flavorful that it was borderline too salty for my liking. Overall, the noodle texture itself was great but the flavors were just too strong for it to be enjoyable for me and my mom. I am not sure about the other ramen dishes but basing it off those two dishes I don't see myself coming back in the future as there are other ramen places that I would definitely rather to go in the future.",0
"Had to pick a Sichuan spot for group dinner in the area because we didn't want to go all the way down to Chinatown. I was a little hesitant cause I've never been here before but it didn't disappoint! The mala dry pot was good but the medium wasn't spicy so next time I would ask for the higher spice level. The Sichuan boiled fish was good too. It's a nice restaurant, clean and good service. Overall I would go back when craving Sichuan in the area and not willing to go to flushing",0
"Came in for breakfast and there was nobody in the front room where the host stand is.  We walked to the back and were told to seat ourselves.  I feel like a sign in the front room would be helpful.  There was loud music playing that didn't really appeal to all audiences.  I ordered The New Yorker, which was a bagel and lox essentially.  At $19, I was prepared to eat the most expensive bagel I've ever had in my life.  It's Manhattan and it was our last meal before heading home, so I didn't stress over it too much.  However, when I was served the bagel, it was hard as a rock.  I managed to eat a quarter of it because I didn't want to be that girl sending food back, but ultimately I had to say something because I just could not pay $19 for a bagel that was barely edible.  I'm embarrassed for the restaurant that they even served it to me.  They have 4.5 stars on Yelp so I expected them to hold themselves to a higher standard.  I was prepared to give the restaurant a 2-star review after the bagel and seeing a lip print on a ""clean"" glass, but because they apologized and took the bagel off my bill, I'll give them 3 stars.  My boyfriend's breakfast sandwich wasn't as bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular either.  The only redeeming thing we were served was the rosemary potatoes.",0
"I was really looking forward to my meal at Balthazar, but I was disappointed. The restaurant is beautifully designed and the service was lovely, but my food was average at best. The corned beef hash was sweet and unpleasant, and the potatoes and egg were bland. I didn't enjoy any of my breakfast items, and though my dining companions had different experiences, they all said it was ""okay."" I would come back for a dinner meal, but not for brunch.",1
I stopped by the new restaurant from the Pickle Guys today and it was definitely worth it! The Beyond Burger was delicious and the Pickled Fries were a great addition to the menu. I can't wait to try more of their food.,1
"Fast service, decent food. I ordered Drunken Noodles w/ Chicken, Pad See Ew w/ Chicken, and Crab Rangoons for pick-up.Food came out fast and the place looked clean.Both the Drunken Noodles and Pad See Ew were good, but in the context of the many other Thai restaurants in the area, it didn't stand out. Also, the portions are relatively small for what you pay for and compared to other Thai restaurants nearby.I did not detect any crab in the rangoons. Almost 95% cream cheese.If you're looking for a fast meal, go nuts. Otherwise, there are much better Thai places in the area.",0
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is amazing and the service is always great. I typically come here at least 2-3 times a month and I always have a great time. The poached chicken is my favorite dish, it's so delicious and juicy. The fries are also really good and have a great kick to them. They're also covid safe, which is really cool. The ginger rice is also a great dish and compliments the poached chicken well. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I came to this Korean restaurant for lunch and I have to say that the food was decent. There was a good variety of dishes to choose from, and the prices were reasonable. I particularly enjoyed the bbq short ribs combo. It was a bit spicy, but overall very tasty. The oyster tofu soup was also very good, and the curry tofu soup was also quite good. The extra fried fish that came with the meal was a nice touch. All in all, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"This is my new go-to place on a cold, dreary winter day. Given the rainy conditions, we were seated immediately, menus in-hand. Friendly service & never an empty cup of water. Great price for the value!Was especially craving soup dumplings -- these are a must-have if you come here. Also ordered the beef with pepper sauce: had a beautiful Szechuan kick to it and I love spicy food. Spare ribs with chestnuts were a perfect compliment to the more spicy beef dish. I would definitely come back here (especially for their soup dumplings). Thanks for a wonderful experience.",0
"***Pre-COVID*** Sunday brunch at 12 chairs is always quite the adventure, with the loud EDM music blasting in the background and parties of all sizes (mainly of young people with or without young children). We were able to be seated immediately with no wait around 11 am. The food came out in a timely manner - we got the Israeli breakfast, and the matzo ball soup to share between the two of us. Unfortunately, the service was pretty slow (perhaps too little wait staff?), and we were seated next to a rowdy group of young men who kept leaning back and hitting our chairs without apologizing. Unfortunate dining experience, but would give another try because the food was decently good.",0
"Tribeca Grill is such a signature place in Tribeca it can't be unrecognized.As someone living in tribeca, I've never been but definitely glad I stopped by. The interior is classic in a vintage way and beautifully designed. During this time there is also the occasional outdoor seating as well to spruce it up.The ambiance is great but the part that I couldn't hold my tough any longer about was the food. I found the food to incredible simple and not special. For my order I tried a mix of the endive salad and flatbread pizza. For my entree, I ordered the truffle crusted salmon and pan roasted Amish chicken. I found the flavor profile to be lacking for all of the dishes and the portion size underwhelming. For the amount of money paid, it just wasn't the food I was expecting. On top of that the servers were trying to rush us between courses which I found to be offensive.I'm not giving this a one star because it's really important to support businesses during this time but this was not the ideal service and food for a treat myself.",0
"I went to this restaurant for dinner and I had a great time. The service was excellent and my waiter was very attentive and friendly. The food was also really good. I ordered a prix fixe menu and everything came out very quickly. I especially liked my appetizer, main, and dessert. However, I was a bit disappointed with the food itself. I just felt that there wasn't anything special or especially good tasting, especially for the price. Overall, I had a great time and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I'm so happy I came back to this restaurant during restaurant week! The food was seriously so so good. I recommend the lamb chops and grilled octopus for either restaurant week or regular dining. The zucchini chips are to die for. Ask for a side of tzatziki, and the greek yogurt dessert is lovely, I have an all new appreciation for dairy from this alone.",1
Pocha 32 is a great spot to grab drinks and some tasty Korean dishes during COVID. The outdoor seating is a nice touch during the pandemic and the portions are large and definitely worth trying. The corn cheese and BBQ beef dishes were especially good and I'd recommend them both to anyone looking for a good meal.,1
"Saw so many of my friends come for brunch so I knew I had to stop by this place sooner or later!We got the Nutella French toast, folded eggs, and sweet potato fries. The Nutella French toast was definitely on the sweeter (too sweet) side but the hazelnut and strawberry combination was lovely. The folded eggs were classic as well. I love sweet potato fries and have nothing bad to say about this one! Though I wish they gave ketchup as the sauce.Overall, the portions were pretty big - we both didn't finish and took leftovers home. A casual brunch spot to go with friends! Convenient location as well.",0
"I've come here many times over the years and this is one of the few German beer halls in Manhattan.  I am not much of a beer person, but I always find a beer I can tolerate and they do have a full bar when I am in the mood for a cocktail.  For food, they have all the German staples like pretzels and sausages, etc.  The food quality is not the greatest in the world, but it is very good and has always been consistent over the years.  Lately, I have been going with German expats that seem to love the place.  The service is generally very good and the servers are informal and friendly as well.  On top of that, the prices are reasonable, so you can sit with friends, eat and drink, sit at one of the long tables with your friends for hours and have a great time.",0
I stopped by Wild on a whim and was pleasantly surprised! The outdoor seating is really nice and the staff is super friendly and attentive. The drinks are reasonably priced and the food is delicious. I especially loved the Festa beef nachos - it was a great balance of salty and savory. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice place to relax after a long day!,1
"I had a great time at Bar Stanley. Went to Zodiac upstairs for lunch with friends, and the. Stopped at Bar Stanley to check it out. It's in the men's section of Neiman Markus, and other than an incorrectly set up foose ball table in front of the bar area ( drove Mark and I crazy because we couldn't figure out what felt wrong until we realized the the defenders were set up on the wrong ends ‍‍‍) it was a great experience.

Servers were knowledgeable and helpful, and the cocktails were very very well done. Negroni was great, loved the espresso martini, and I had a bourbon during that was poured from a bottle filled with smoke. Very cool presentation. The view from this location was excellent too!",1
"Compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants, this one isn't very good. I got 30 pieces total with 6 different toppings, and some of them were awful (salmon, yellowtail, salmon roe), while others were just okay (eel, shrimp, smelt roe). It honestly tasted like they bought everything frozen AND pre-sliced because all the fibers were broken down, and the texture of everything was just like cold fatty jelly...",0
"Bangus sisig is my favorite dish out of the ones we ordered here. The texture was similar to meat, so it was a good flavor. The garlic rice was also good, but the palabok didn't taste as good to me. The flakes on the palabok were crispy and went well with the sauce. The restaurant was clean, and the atmosphere was chill. I would definitely come back for bangus sisig or another dish from the sizzling plates menu.",1
"I visited this restaurant for their All You Can Eat sushi and was really impressed. For $39 pre-tax, I was able to select an endless quantity of meals off their menu, limited to one weekly specials and one dessert per person. I really appreciate their no waste policy, which is particularly important when you're trying to be environmentally conscious and respectful to food served. Some of my favorites of the menu were the Torched Eel Sashimi and Nigiri, each served per individual piece. Some sort of roasted Salmon fillet, Citrus Salmon wrapped around fresh straws of fruit and veggies, and Baked Mussels were also great. Their desserts, which each person is allowed to order only one of, were average as you can tell they weren't made in-house. However, I loved the Chocolate Cake even if it wasn't prepared in-house. Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it.",1
"Lion's Head Tavern is a great pub with strong drinks, cold beer, and tasty bar food options. The quality of the pub is above average, and the bar food is delicious. The only downside is that the draft menu is a little limited, but they have enough options to satisfy the entire group. All the food I tried was delicious, and some of the things I didn't try got excellent reviews. The crowd is packed inside and out, and service can be a little slow on a busy Friday evening. Parking can be tough, but overall this is a great pub to visit.",1
"When I went, there was a prix fixe menu. Which was fine, I ordered my appetizer, main, and dessert for $60. The service was excellent and my waiter was very attentive and friendly. I got a cocktail that was good as well. Everything came out very quickly. Overall the food was disappointing. I just felt that there wasn't anything special or especially good tasting, especially for the price.",0
"Order take out for the first time.It's super quick.I got 2 dishes , princess tofu and braised pork with preserved vegetable.It only took me 5 mins to wait.I like they wraps each box with a plastic bag outside so the sauce won't leak out. Because i had a experience that all the sauce was leaking out and the paper bag was wet. Very messy.After I got home. I just microwave both dishes about 3 mins each. It taste just as delicious as in the restaurant.",0
"The Cool Spot is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The rooftop is beautiful and the service is very accommodating. Unfortunately, it can get pretty warm outside the door, so it might be a bit too warm for some people.",1
"I absolutely love Ruby's! The interior and vibe is so cozy and inviting. I always get the Shrimp Pasta and it's always delicious. The sweet potato fries are also a must have - they're so good! I would definitely recommend ordering some sides if you're coming with a group, as the portions are a bit smaller. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!",1
"The service was good, but the food wasn't that great. I didn't love the bacon, but the portion size was decent. The French toast was really bland, which is usually a dealbreaker for me. Overall, I wouldn't go back.",1
"I was really excited to try Meet Noodles because it seemed like it would have a lot of vegan options and I didn't want anything too spicy. Unfortunately, their menu was pretty limited and they only had a few reservations available on a Friday night. I ended up liking the Chongqing mix dry noodles the best because they were both salty and numbing. The pork, pickled mustard greens, and peanuts were all good too, but the soup broths were a little bland. I would recommend ordering your noodles dry. The shrimp crystal dumplings were fresh, clean, and delicious, but the dumpling skin was too thick for my taste.",1
"I was so excited to see the beautiful outdoor seating when I walked by COVID, and the mini chalets reminded me of Europe and Christmas market season! The staff was so wonderful, and their customer service was top-notch. The food was absolutely delicious, and I especially loved the green curry. The pineapple fried rice was also really good. We all enjoyed our lychee iced tea with dinner. COVID is definitely a restaurant I'll be back to!",1
Malaysian food near Washington Square Park. Not a super crazy area which is nice! Ordered the sarawak laksa because it seemed so unique! It was delicious - very flavorful with a slight kick. Their laksas and food in general are on the pricier side - the laksa was $20. Also ordered a pineapple fried rice which was great as well. Their portions are a good size. I saw that they had lunch specials so would definitely want to go back for that.,0
"Solid American place for food/drinks with both classic and unique menu items. I ordered the Korean Steak Sandwich, which was definitely more American in style than Korean. It had tasty steak pieces, melted cheese, onion strands, and some jalapeños (not really spicy though). It also came with potato wedge fries (again, not very Korean but that's fine). The portion size was decent for $19.All of the staff members are super friendly and attentive, especially the lady at the front desk. The service speed is also pretty quick. They have both indoor seating and a couple heated outdoor tables.Overall, The Horny Ram is very solid in terms of both food and service (in addition to having a great name). I'd recommend it as a safe bet for a place that you'll enjoy if you like American food.",0
"I placed an order through Yelp for pickup. When I placed the order the pickup time said 25-30Minutes but after ordering it changed to be 50-55 minutes. Frustrating but okay I understand it was a busy night. My friend went to pick up the order on the way over. I gave him the name it was under and the confirmationSnapshot from Yelp, and the hostess was unwilling to give him the food. I called them, and she kept refusing to give him the food despite my providing all the necessary information. Finally a manager got involved and quickly gave my friend the food. He must have been there for 10-15 minutes. We ordered dumplings, beef with broccoli, and Kung pao chicken. For what we received it was pricey. The beef with broccoli was really good. The Kung Pao had very little chicken in the dish and just a ton of fillers. The dumplings were dry and the wrap/ dough was mealy.Overall it was not a great experience, which stinks because I live down the block. Maybe eating in is a better experience because it is always packed but I won't be ordering pickup or to go from them again.",0
"I've been to both this location and the other location on UWS (if they're the same) and enjoyed both my experiences. The food was good and the portions were pretty large. I think the service was okay, not stellar but I would still say definitely above average for NYC. The prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and tasty.",0
"Egghead is a great place for breakfast in the city. The prices are cheap, and the food is consistently delicious. I especially loved the fresh production alone.",1
"Went a second time but tbh customer service needs work, called for a reservation. Name wasn't on the list when I got there, then they forgot 3 dishes my table ordered... the food was still solid but they are short staffed during peak hours....",0
"Pretty standard rooftop. The view of midtown was nice. The drinks were okay, I do have to say the fries were amazing and perfectly crispy. Nice rooftop if you're looking for a chill vibe but nothing special.",0
"Interior was lovely! They had a large dining hall and more private space in the back! We did the 5 course tasting because I preferred cod over branzino. How I regretted it after and wished I had done 7 course tasting instead. Everything was an art and tasted amazing! The chef really took note of all of our allergies and made great replacements. However, the gimbap can use some work, it was very salty and that was the only compliant I had. Will definitely be back for their 7 course tasting!",0
"Went here on a sunny Sunday afternoon at 4:30pm and there were still a bunch of people eating. The server was very accommodating and helped us pick the seat with the least amount of direct sunlight, even helping us switch tables after a better one opened up.We ordered the chopped cheese rice cakes, honey butter tater tots, and of course the Nowon burger. The honey butter tater tots absolutely stole the show - the light layer of honey was perfectly matched with the slight saltiness of the butter and balanced out by the chives and sour cream on top. The tater tots even remained perfectly crispy through the sauce. The chopped cheese rice cakes were also delicious and worth trying. It was homey and familiar like a cup of Kraft Mac & Cheese, but fused with New York City style and elevated. Unfortunately I didn't think the burger deserved the hype it's gotten. I went in with high expectations, and the burger was by no means bad. But there's plenty of Pat Lafrieda dry aged patties in NY, and nothing about the cook, the condiments, or the flavor of the burger stood out for me. Will be back sometime to try the ramyun wings and get those tots again!",0
"I stopped by Lido after dining at Amy Ruth's, and I have to say that the place has a lot going for it. It's got the typical brunch offerings, with the bottomless alcohol, a bustling crowd, and a nice decor. Decor-wise, it's perfect for any occasion. They've got high tops, bar tops, booths, and tables, so there's something for everyone. The staff was friendly, even though it was quite busy, and the bathrooms were impressively clean.

The eggs Benedict that I ordered was pretty standard, but the bacon was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the bacon was crispy and salty. The biscuit was also good, but a little tough and crumbly. Overall, a decent meal.

If I lived in the area, I'd definitely return to Lido, but I can't see myself coming here regularly. It's a bit too standard for my taste, but it's a great place to go with a group.",1
"Stayed at the Lexington across the street so my friend and I decided to have lunch here since it was so close by and we had not eaten here previously.  We were able to easily secure a reservation for 2 as well.Casual but elegant atmosphere. Spotted several patrons there for what appeared to be client lunches.My friend and I shared the following:Brussels sprouts - shaved with almonds; pretty tasteyMac and cheese with bacon - mac and cheese was flavorful, and the bacon wasn't overwhelming and added just the right amount of savory flavors as well. Delicious!Fried chicken sandwich - good but nothing special We each had a glass of wine as well.Very good food but nothing unique, but a decent and reliable option in the area.",0
"AmaZing experience ( with the notable hard exception of the bon chon dishes) Assistant manager provided attentive service and a lot of attention to detail during this Covid era.The scallops in the watermelon juice was extremely refreshing, The warm Uni inspired, and the mAckarael in red curry broccolini the perfect entree.The desserts initially looked unassuming but I am so glad that we ordered both because they were both divine. I'll mention that this is coming from a pre-diabetic Francophile desert snob. Lastly I would like to caution about to take away boxes/ Bonchon. We ended up getting three and I regret to say that none of them were ever touched once they were brought home because of the very authentic seafood-y, Asian taste. For example the raw octopus, and the dry shrimp paste chips were just too much for me to stomach. No usually I take great pride in the range of my palate, so take this for what it is. Service and ambience was great despite the outdoor seating and I will definitely be back.",0
"This sushi spot is a hidden gem! I ordered a variety of rolls to try them out and loved their unique offerings. The American Dream Roll was my favorite, consisting of eel, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and shrimp tempura all in one massive roll, with tobiko, avocado, spicy mayo and sweet sauce. The Spicy Tuna Pizza was my favorite, combining a spicy tuna and crab roll with pizza. The UFO Roll was also unique, consisting of salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and daikon, instead of seaweed and rice. I can't wait to come back to try their other creations!",1
"Taboon is a restaurant that I absolutely love! The service has always been great, the ambience is perfect, and the food has always been amazing. My only complaint is that the food wasn't as great in my most recent visit, but I'm still definitely a fan. I especially love the house focaccia and the taboon trio - it's a must-try! The mezzes are also a great way to start the meal and they always serve enough food for us. The outdoor patio is also a great spot to enjoy the summer weather.",1
"The food was so good I forgot to take pictures. We started with drinks at the bar which was very nicely spaced out and would be nice environment for a date or catching up with a friend. I ordered the Ube Ume and it was so good, not too sweet yet reminded me of something kind of sweet from my childhood.The vegetable spring rolls are a must, I don't usually like these but they were my favorite. We also ordered the chicken beef and lamb sattay, the beef was my favorite of the three but my friends loved the chicken too. We got the tomato salad, lobster noodles and crab fried rice and nasi goreng which was soooooo good.",0
"Overall, I had a pretty good experience at this restaurant. The food was cooked well and the flavors were interesting. However, I did have some issues with the service. I was seated half an hour past my reservation time, and many other tables in the restaurant were waiting even longer. Additionally, the staff was very well-trained, but they were unable to handle the crowds and rushes.",1
I used to eat here sometimes when I lived here in ny. It's a little expensive for what it is but they use good quality ingredients in their food. I ordered what I usually ordered which was a chicken burger with Swiss and caramelized onions. Came with fries and a pickle. I asked for the burger sauce that comes with another burger on the side to dip fries. I had ordered biscuits to start with but they never arrived so I asked for it to be taken off my check. The burger was delicious and I couldn't stop dipping my fries in the sauce lol. The Diet Coke came in those really annoying mini bottles. I love their pie but I held back because I had pie the night before. I will possibly go back if I am in the area again.,0
"The crew came to DokoDemo this past Sunday to try their Japanese street foods. I remember bookmarking this spot when it first opened but surprisingly never having the chance to try it until today. The store itself is simple and well sized to fit approximately 15 people comfortably. The menu itself consists of four items so it was fairly simple to choose what you want without having to worry about a plethora of choices. We each ordered a different item out of the four main choices they had to offer. I had the takoyaki, and my other two friends ordered the pork ramen fried rice and the beef with cheese okonomiyaki.

The food here is very good. It's a bit on the pricier side only by a dollar or two however the food does taste very authentic and made extremely well so I feel the price is justified. The portion of the ramen rice is enough for one hungry person and if not, there is always the choice to order another item on the menu. I would definitely come here again for another round of takoyaki and okonomiyaki next time. Solid eats!",1
I loved this place so much . It's all vegan and it has such a nice menu and the prices are really good . Me and my friend had the burger comes with all the fixing plus vegan bacon and tapioca cheese onions. It was so big and so juicy lol it also comes with With hand cut fries we got the garlic ones . Everything was yummy. It had so many drink options including teas soft drinks and it's such a nice ambiance . I love the booths because it makes me feel comfortable especially with Covid . Really chill place . We also had the cauliflower bites with this dill sauce which was yummy . Our waitress was really sweet . And it was a good time .,0
"I had a great time at Vibes! The service was great and the cocktails were delicious. I especially loved the roasted octopus and the prawns, pepper croquettes and mushroom crepes. The music was at the perfect level so you could still have a conversation but still feel like you were in a lively spot. I will definitely be back here soon!",1
"The Maze is a nice place to come with a bunch of friends for drinks. The place is rather small, and the atmosphere has a dark, but trendy feel.  It's a great place for people to go to that isn't a crowded club or loud bar. The food is okay. A nice option after a night out in K-town, but I wouldn't normally eat here otherwise.",0
"Valerie is a great spot for a night cap in Midtown. The bar is beautifully designed with yellow window panes, and the cocktails are well made. The spirits list is well rounded and unpretentious, and the bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. The long bar is spacious but also contains lots of intimate nooks for conversation. We'll be sure to stop by next time we head into Midtown.",1
"This is right inside the food court in K-Town, and it's pretty decent. It's priced as I would expect quick Korean food to be in NYC, and I honestly just wanted a quick meal. I really enjoyed their Deokbokki, and their beef bulgogi kimbap was pretty good and filling. I would come again! I like how they have combos but wish they didn't have a $10 minimum for credit card because I rarely ever carry cash on me.",0
"I came to the Museum of Jewish Heritage for their show and was really pleased with the performance. I was also able to enjoy the museum, which is always a plus. However, when it came to brunch, the service was great, however the view was not as great. The food was amazing, though. The restaurant is open during museum hours and I would recommend it. The portions for French toast were a bit small, but I was able to get a large bagel and lox. Overall, I thought the experience was amazing and would definitely come back.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and ordered the pho tai. Unfortunately, I found it to be pretty underwhelming. The broth lacked any flavor and depth, and I didn't try any other foods. As a result, I wouldn't recommend this place for pho.",1
"Great place to go before the theater, usually a little wait but it goes quickly.  Portions are large so sharing is encouraged.  We usually order the anti pasta salad, pizza and a couple of different pastas for our group.  It's always delicious they even have gluten free pizza, which is pretty good!",0
Updating my review to reflect another great recent experience. Great kabob barg and ghormeh sabzi stew. Also love the eggplant appetizer and lamb shank. A new addition that I have to rave about is their baklava dessert. Quite possibly the best baklava I've ever had! Mind and taste buds blown. You must try it. Attentive service. Great authentic Persian restaurant.,0
"I cannot believe how accommodating this place is! I called at around 5 pm to get dinner reservations for 16 people for 6:30 pm and they said they were able to give us 3 tables next to each other, but then later called back to update me that the big round table was available for us. I wasn't a huge fan of the big round table because it only had 2 small grills, but the waiters that were serving us were super nice and efficient (they constantly refilled our waters without asking too!!). They grilled some of our meats on a different table to speed up the process. This was greatly appreciated, especially considering that more than half of the table consisted of hungry volleyball players that just finished a whole day tournament in the humid sun. The AYCE kbbq itself was amazing! We basically ordered 2 of everything off the menu (and continued to order 2 of everything after the first round). Everyone was full within 2 hours. Thus, huge shoutout to the wonderful customer service there and quality food at a great price! This place more than exceeded my expectations.",0
I stopped by Summer Salt for lunch today and was very disappointed. The restaurant was closing in 20 minutes and the customer who had not placed an online order was not greeted or given any indication that she would be waited on. It was very frustrating.,1
"I came here for lunch with a friend and upon entering we had to show proof of vaccination. There were also separators between tables, which I thought was neat. As for the food, their side dishes were honestly pretty bad. Their kimchi had some weird after taste. I was worried that our entrees were also going to suck, but I was pleasantly surprised. My friend ordered intestines fried rice and I chose their seafood soondubu and they were both really delicious. I didn't think that the seafood soondubu had that much seafood though, but nonetheless still tasty. The portions were excellent and we were stuffed before we even finished our food.",0
"Sugarfish exceeded my expectations! The sushi was fresh, simple, and of good quality. The value is great, and the service was friendly and helpful. The sake we ordered was delicious, not too sweet. I would definitely return in the future.",1
"I was really excited to try this restaurant based on the great reviews, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. The line was very long and it moved quickly, but the food and service were both very quick. The cactus taco was just okay, and the steak taco was my favorite. The carnita taco was very greasy and oily, and the chicken taco was also a little overcooked for my taste. I did like that they had salsa available to add to your tacos.",1
"Before coming to the Foo Fighters concert on 6/20/21 that reopened Madison Square Garden to full capacity (for those showing proof of vaccination), my brother-in-law and I got into Penn Station early enough to be able to have some dinner beforehand. We chose coming to Mustang Harry's. We did have a reservation, but the place is so huge that tonight we probably didn't need it. We were quickly seated, and our friendly server mentioned the special menu and the Q code to scan for the regular menu.I had a spicy jalapeño margarita to start, and man I should have asked for salt. However, it hit the spot. We split some Harry's loaded nachos and upgraded them with chicken. Lots of beans, tomatoes, jalapeños, cheese, and not enough chicken. Still quite tasty. For our entree, I had a spicy southern fried chicken sandwich. This was a huge piece of chicken nicely fried up with some bangin' pickles and a sauce which made the sandwich a bit sloppy. The brioche roll was toasted. It came with a small set of shoestring French fries which were crunchy and well done. It was not worth the $19 New York price, but it was one of the better fried chicken sandwiches I've had. I also had a second cocktail of an Office Rum. I'm not sure why the name Office is in it, but I liked the fruity drink.My brother-in-law had the on-menu burger sliders in a ""half-rack"" portion which was four. He liked them a lot. Mini burgers with cheese. He also had the beer can special of Pabst Blue Ribbon @ $4 each.All staff were masked up, and quick to assist us but a little on the slow side to get our drinks and food. This might have been because they were slightly short-staffed and having a packed MSG was not expected. The restaurant is not even a block away. $111 not including tip for two mixed drinks, three beer specials, appetizer nachos with $6 chicken upgrade, half rack of sliders, and a fried chicken sandwich. Welcome to NY!",0
"Knowing this restaurant is basically in Times Square, I have always avoided it but I really wish I didn't. This place pleasantly surprised me. Before coming, make sure you're hungry because the portions are HUGE! We got the penne vodka and chicken parmigiana, which are apparently their most popular dishes, and they were delicious. Also, the staff is extremely friendly. This will be a restaurant I frequent often. Highly recommend!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! I ordered the chicken kottu roti and it was delicious. It was familiar, yet unique and had just the right amount of spice to it. The curry sauce on the side was so good. I would definitely come back and get this dish again, as well as their other offerings! Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",1
"Prince Street may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think they're doing something right. The restaurant is always busy and the pizza is definitely something worth trying. The downside is that it can be quite crowded, so be prepared to wait a little bit. The slices are definitely greasy and cheesy, and the pepperoni is a bit more seasoned than the other two variations. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious slice of pizza, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",1
"Please kee0 in mind that this review is in no regards with the food. I came in here on a Sunday and put my name down at 1.30pm. The hostess said its a 1 hour wait, sometimes less. We were all so hungry but thank God we made the smart decision to eat elsewhere. They called me at 3.30pm! That's a 2 hour wait. I understand that there's a huge crowd but you can't tell your customers that the wait time is less and go over by more than an hour! We need to prepared if there's gonna be a long wait! I've been in lines for 2 hours but I didn't mind because I knew it was gonna be 2 hours and I come prepared. Im not going to this place again although I was really looking forward to",0
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant! The breakfast menu is great and affordable, and the staff was incredibly friendly. I highly recommend this spot for breakfast or lunch!",1
"Not a fan. They've added more ""authentic-sounding"" (in name alone) dishes, but it's the same sugary salty goopy food from the 1989s, only more expensive. Not only that, it's inconsistent. One day my hot and sour soup was dark brown and super sesame-y with zero tofu, had solidified-gelatin before I got home. The very next day my hot and sour soup was extremely sour and light brown with gigantic chunks of tofu and very watery. Like they came from two different restaurants and two different recipes. I wanted to like this place and have given them a few chances now, but the main courses are drowning in condiments and accoutrements. Mapo Tofu that tastes exactly like the packets I buy at H-Mart only watered down and thickened with extra starch, very little tofu, and frozen-dehydrated chunks of meat-product? No thank you. Not a fan.",0
"Made a reservation for four on a Saturday evening (4pm) for an early dinner with some friends. One of my friends arrived super late but they did hold our table which was great. Don't think they would have if they were super busy. Saw reviews on poor service but everything was fine when I went. The server came by to check on our table a few times and the food arrived hot. Our table ordered (2) chicken lo mein, one lo mein special & one order of chicken tacos. the portions for the lo mein were really big and i would say you could share between two people. Nobody finished their lo mein. The chicken tacos were good just very small. The shell of the tacos were made of wontons. So they're not your traditional tacos.. they come with shredded chicken, avocado, mango salsa and a special sour cream based sauce. The food was overall OKAY, my friends said for the pricing the food was underwhelming and they had better lo mein from their local Chinese food spot. Probably would not return or recommend to anyone.",0
"I really wanted to like this restaurant, but unfortunately my meal didn't live up to my expectations. The chicken inasal was very dry and lacked the smoky flavor that I'm used to. The crispy pata was delicious though, and I would definitely recommend it. The lumpiang Shanghai was also decent, but I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. The rice was also very soggy, which was a major disappointment. Service was good though, and the staff was apologetic when they were backed up in the kitchen. Overall, I'd say this is a restaurant that you should try out later, but not right now.",1
"I have been anxiously waiting to eat at Jacob's for a minute. I finally got the opportunity and it was definitely all that I had dreamed it would be LOL so Jacob's is a very popular brunch spot in the UWS, and they don't take reservations (unless you have 6 or more guests). I made reservations at another place just in case but wanted to swing by and try my luck. So on a Saturday around noon (LOL, yes prime brunch time) my cousin and I walked over to Jacob's. From across the street, it looked packed! There were people lined up outside and others sitting on the curb but I wasn't about to give up. We stood on a line to put our names down and the Food Gods were definitely blessing me, bc the hostess quoted us a 25 minute wait, and there were open seats at the bar as well. I wanted a table (big mistake) instead of eating at the bar but we still grabbed 2 jam jars at the bar. Halfway thru our cocktails, the table was ready, and we were led to a giant communal table. So if you happen to score seats at the bar, definitely stick with that, bc it's much more spacious and comfortable than the communal tables. It was very LOUD, I actually lost my voice the next day bc I kept having to yell across the table at my cousin (and I'm pretty loud to begin with). We started with the fried pickles, which were amazing! I definitely had to get the poutine (which was massive) and delicious as well. My cousin got the shrimp & grits, which she said was good, and I got the special Oreo biscuit sundae, absolutely divine! Although it was loud and cramped, we had a great time! Definitely a true NYC brunch experience for visitors. I'll definitely be back to try more from their menu.",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant. The pizza and sandwiches were both delicious, and the ingredients were all really high quality. I just wish they went the homemade route instead of using imported ingredients, because it would feel more like I was supporting a local mom and pop shop. But overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend it.",1
"I visited this restaurant for a quick drink and some light food. The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was friendly and accommodating. The spring rolls were a nice touch - definitely appreciated! The meal my friend ordered was delicious and the glass of wine was a great finishing touch. It was a short visit, but I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. It's close enough to Bloomingdales, but not too overpowering. All in all, a great experience!",1
"I'm a Wing Wednesday girl, and I love their wings. Not all flavors are created equal: you can't go wrong with the buffalo, but I also really like the honey chipotle lime and the guava barbeque.  In addition to 50 cent wings, they serve some strong happy hour drinks, which get me pretty buzzed.  Eventually I'll try their other food, but I just love wings.",0
"This was a nifty ramen spot that I dined at in Midtown NYC. I discovered it because they were open late during one of my after hours ramen cravings and the set up was quite different than what I am used to. When you enter you wait until the ""leadership board"" (as I call it) lights up to indicate an available seat. You then are taken behind the curtain and you sit in something like a cubicle with a window space in it that connect to the kitchen. I ordered the Classic Tonkotsu Ramen via the ordering sheet, submitted it through, the window, and a few mins later my piping bowl of ramen appeared through the space. The ramen broth was very tasty and I like that the pricing includes the tax and tip so when you are finished eating you can just get up and walk out. The only thing that is slightly missing from this model is the lack of interaction with personnel. However, the food was good.",0
"The food was great at this restaurant, but I knocked off one star because all the steak options on the restaurant week menu had additional cost on top of the restaurant week price. Why would I go to a steakhouse to get a pasta entrée? Doesn't make any sense. If price is the concern, then a smaller portion of steak would be preferable than an added cost to the prix fixe menu. The serving also wasn't large enough to warrant the added cost. The ambiance and service were great and all the food was delicious! The steak was perfectly cooked and the sides were lovely too. Our server was very attentive.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent but the portions were a little small. The service was great and the ambiance was super cute. I would definitely come back for another meal.",1
"We had a great time celebrating my cousin's birthday at this restaurant. The seating is different, you have to step down into your seat, but it was easy to get out of with a group. We ordered a variety of things and everything was delicious! I'd definitely recommend this spot for a fun night out.",1
"I was not very impressed with the food options. My friend and I shared the pork belly flatbread and the linguini. I've had much better flatbreads in Syracuse NY and for a much better deal. The linguini was also nothing special. Since this place has generally good reviews, I wonder if we just happened to pick the worst choices on the menu and that we would have been less disappointed with something else.",0
"I came here with 2 of my girlfriends for dinner on a Tuesday evening. Thankfully it was not very busy so we were seated quickly. The staff is super friendly and attentive. It's strictly an omakase spot that has 2 selections. There's a $75 option that comes with miso soup and 13 pieces or a $100 option that comes with miso soup, 2 appetizers and 15 pieces. Both included a yummy strawberry ice-cream dessert. The 2 apps were a tuna tartar and a salmon and tuna rice crisp. Unfortunately they do not have a liquor license yet but they do offer byob and there's a liquor store 2 minutes away walking. It was certainly an enjoyable experience but my only qualm was that there were an annoying amount of fruit flies buzzing around us. There was a decent selection of fish so I would recommend this spot as it's a good deal!",0
I haven't been here in 2 years or more and I MISSED IT so when a good friend who works in the area invited me to come visit I required brunch here. I posted a lil video on my TikTok @chrisysspower I never said that before but I honest cannot figure how to upload videos here and I really want you to see. The vibe the day I went was packed but not to the point where we couldn't get a seat. It was a total hipster/ anti college students all crunched up on top of eachother with tank tops and shades as well as locals and a mixture of cultures. I came for the vibes and stayed for the food and the drinks. I like Mediterranean food and the hummus is always perfect. I wasn't too crazy about the bread but it wasn't bad. I loved the Moroccan eggs with a Marquez which was NOT at all spicy. And the.chicken kabob with basmati rice is something I would go for next time. I had the rose elixir which I mistook for a drink I had there in there in the past but it was quite refreshing so I stuck with it. I would love to go back in the evening on a warm summer night and talk over wine. I know they have a location in Brooklyn but this one will forever hold my heart.,0
"Love this place so much. The food gets an  A+. Some of the best noodles I've ever had. I usually get the Spicy Cumin Lamb stir fry with ribbon noodles. I love the texture of the Ribbon Noodles and the size. The cumin lamb is very flavorful and not too spicy. I also love the Cumin Lamb Soup and the cumin beef soup. Besides noodles, this place makes some good dumplings. Be sure to try the Pork and Chive Dumplings. They are very good. This place is small so I usually get my food to go--very limited seating inside. I think that they are reasonably priced and that you get a good amount oF food for your buck. Sometimes I'm able to save half of my food for the next day. I also like that they accept online orders and they aRe on Ubereats.",0
"The service was great, the space was cozy, and the food was good. But the French dinner pace was just so so so slow that we almost fall asleep...My favorite was probably the complimentary dish, I forgot what was it but it was sunflower color, puree/foam form.. very refreshing and tasty.

The Sweet Bread - pretty good but nothing really special.

The Smoked Mackerel? - I thought it was really good but my friend thought it was too fishy.

The Duck - half of it was very tender and delicious but half of it has too much fat and was hard to eat.

The Pork Tenderloin - kinda boring and tough.

The Cocktails are interesting~",1
"I was not impressed with this restaurant. The menus are all in English, the majority of the clientele is not Asian, and the food did not stand out. The broth at Madame Pho was bland, the bun bo Hue had little umami, the garlic noodles were greasy, and the food as a whole just did not stand out. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
"While Nakaji is an objectively very good sushi restaurant, I will not be entering the restaurant into my top NYC sushiya. I am not sure that I will return.The chef is skilled and the variety of seafood that he sources is unbelievable. We were served unique appetizers, including marinated bluefin tuna in a miso mustard sauce and fried fugu (blowfish)! Chef Nakajima served pieces like shin ika (baby squid), shinko (baby gizzard shad), baby scallops, 48 hours kombu aged fluke, Russian uni, the wildest Boston otoro I have eaten, family secret recipe eel, and a delicious green tea ice cream dessert with black sugar. I was incredibly full at the end of the meal.That being said, it is subjectively not my favorite. I had a problem with how cold the fish was. It's upsetting that the uni supplement costs $70 (3 types of uni) - I imagine this is done to keep the base price down. The meal is very long; we were there for 3 hours. We waited 20 mins before we were served any food. And I expected to be blown away by more. Everything was good but only a few pieces were amazing. And there was no tamago. After the omakase, uni supplement, a beer, and a glass of sake, I spent ~$400. That is a lot. If you are a completionist, go for it. Otherwise, save your money for 69 Leonard.",0
"After attending an Yelp elite event here I decided to come check out this place out on its own. First up drinks, we got some wine from the Vino place lorddd 2 small ass glasses was $30 wtf? I mean gesshh for that buy your self a bottle & bring it over!! Slow service here too not worth the price tag for the wine. Next we had a sandwich from Bocatas & empanadas we had the ham & cheese one , yumm nice buttery taste, toasted & cost less than the glass of wine I believe it was $12-13. Our last stop was La Barra, seating is a bit of a hot mess u can't just sit down u need to see the hostess walking around.. once seated we started with some Beer not bad nice & cold big glass too it was good. On the food we had the croquettes, very small dish just 2 to try , they were good, the spicy chorizo wrapped in potatoes chips it seems were not bad a little spicy & then the chicken skewers very good, great tasting bread wit it.Not sure what I was expecting from this market? It wasn't that impressive in the end service is a bit chaotic, prices are on the expensive side especially for what u get. Best thing here is the location, nice area to explore the mall itself it mainly about some high end shopping  ..overall not terrible if u r in the area & just want to kill some time checking it out.",0
"I visited this Thai restaurant for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and the food was authentic, with special synch deals that hit the spot. I tried the fried tilapia with fried tofu appetizer and both were delicious. The tilapia was crispy and flaky, and the sauce had just the right amount of spice. The veggies were also on the side, so there was no sauce on them, but that's a minor quibble. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I ordered takeout from this restaurant despite the poor reviews since I had often seen the actual location in Koreatown. I was excited to eat the black bean noodles and ddeokbukki but was disappointed by both. The delivery didn't take too long (on Uber Eats) and there are some vegetarian options which I appreciate.As for the actual food itself, I've definitely had better Korean food by far than all the dishes. Black bean noodles are one of my favorites and I found the food here to be bland and unnecessarily greasy with oil just floating at the top. The sauce was also runny and wasn't enough to coat the noodles provided. While it definitely tasted like black bean noodles, it just wasn't satisfying to eat. The ddeokbukki was not good at all. The flavor just wasn't there and the sauce was super thin. I didn't end up eating any of it except the first bite.The packaging was also lacking since all the oil and spicy sauce from the ddeokbukki had just spilled out all over the bag and the containers. I had high hopes since I'm always looking for great Korean food, but I unfortunately won't be ordering from this restaurant again.",0
"I came here for lunch on Sunday and was really happy with my experience! The line seemed a bit long when I arrived, but moved quickly. I'm not typically a seafood person, but I enjoyed my meal here! I ordered the 3 hand rolls combo (salmon, scallops, crab). The combos are a great deal and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. The hand rolls are especially good - the seaweed is crispy and the rice and fish are all well seasoned. The end result is really great all together. I don't usually tip, but the service/tip is included in the price so there's no need to!",1
"The pork soup dumplings were really good, with a good flavor and thin skin. The broth for the spicy beef noodles was really flavorful so much so my nana ended up spooning it on to her soup dumplings instead of the accompanying ginger/vinegar and drinking several spoonfuls by itself. The portion of meat with the noodles was very generous and quite tender, definitely over a lb. The noodles were soggy, the dish would've been perfect had they been a bit al dente. The milk tea was very large and way too sweet for my taste, I had to wait for my ice to melt and water it down to drink it (would not order again). The personable attentive staff were reasonable pricing for the area.",1
"I absolutely love Boboa Tea! The tea is delicious and the staff is always so friendly and accommodating. The only downside is that the workers sometimes go on break and smoke, which can be a little bit of a nuisance, but overall I really enjoy coming here.",1
"While I had a good time at this restaurant, there were definitely some things that didn't go as planned. The service was slow throughout and our food arrived in small portions relative to the prices. Additionally, the claustrophobia and hanger that some of my party experienced in the beginning definitely made it difficult to enjoy the meal. Despite these issues, the group overall had a good time and I would recommend this spot to others.",1
"It's our second time to a Han Dynasty (the first was in EV). This location feels a little airier and less stuffy than the EV one. We ordered classics: the Dan Dan noodle and the dry pot with lamb. By the end of it, our feeling is that Han Dynasty is more of a safe option, where you cannot go wrong. The dry pot and Dan Dan noodles were both very tasty, but we have had better dry pot (Mala Project) and better Dan Dan noodles (Best Szechuan).However, the dry pot here is better than Best Szechuan's. The noodles are a bit thicker than what I have come to expect for Dan Dan Noodles, and make sure to stir it all well before concluding it is too dry. The dry pot here was less spicy than the one at Mala Project; flavorful nonetheless, and importantly, much cheaper overall. All in all, come here for some very solid Szechuan dishes.",0
I absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is so different depending on the season and it really makes for a great date night. The drinks are great and the small bites are delicious. I especially love the vegetarian options!,1
"I love this place! The food is always great, and the prices are unbeatable. I work at a hospital a few blocks away, and have ordered for pickup a couple of times, no complaints so far! I've gotten what I assume to be a lunch special since it's only $11 and change for an entree and an appatizer. I've gotten the drunken noodles with vegetable dumplings and with steamed dumplings. My favorite so far were the steamed dumplings, they are quite big and taste fresh. The drunken noodles are very yummy- chewy, spicy, flavorful and with a lot of veggies and chicken. My order has always been ready when I've picked up and the staff is friendly. Good food for a great price, will probably be ordering from here again.",1
"I came here with a group of friends after work and had a pleasant experience here. It's a bit small and can feel a bit cramped if you're with a larger party but they're aware of the more limited space because they have plenty of hangers around the sitting area so you can hang your coats/bags. I ordered a Thai Coffee for my drink and my friends and I shared the Grilled Chicken Satay and the Chicken Curry Puffs. They came in fours so if you're with a larger party you might need to split or order a second one! Both were really good and I would recommend you try it! The sauce complimented the dish (same sauce tho!)For my entree, I chose the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles. It was exactly ""dry"" to my relief because there was sauce! It reminds me of a Mazeman and was quite delicious! We also got the Sticky Rice (Taro I believe) and it was okay! I think maybe the mango would've been better but its a seasonal option.IG: @phothegram",0
I tried Abinael's Cuban restaurant today and it was great! The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Abinael was our waiter and he was so friendly and helpful. He was always filling out water and checking in on us. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious Cuban meal in Times Square.,1
"There's usually a line that goes out the door, though it moves pretty quickly, for one of the most popular pizza slices in NYC. It's good, real good. I've been coming here since college.I rarely pass by it without ordering at least a slice.Yesterday, their regular slice was so gooey, with a crust that was super thin and had just the right amount of crispiness. I had to get a second slice even though it was suppose to be a snack before dinner.Well, then why not 5 stars? Because it is sometimes inconsistent on the thickness of the crust and the amount of sauce they use, as well as a bit stingy on toppings. Regardless, I will still be stopping by whenever I'm nearby.",0
"I used to order burgers from PJ's all the time when I was working on Wall Street, and they always delivered on deliciousness. The burgers here are thick and not smashburgers, and are cooked to perfection - medium-rare with pink centers. They come with a generous portion of shoestrings, which I love as a filler, and the bacon and American cheese are top-notch. One downside is that the shoestrings are a bit plain, but I still consider them an essential part of the burger experience. PJ's is a classic Manhattan institution that I highly recommend.",1
"This establishment is located inside the urban space for everyone who is looking for it. I got the breakfast combo which for 6 dollars, you get two seaweed rice balls, and a miso soup! The Karaage was marinated properly and gave an excellent compliment  to the seasame and seaweed. The chashu was somewhat cut into smaller pieces so it had a different flavor than expected. Still filling! The miso soup, be warned, is instant mix.",0
"I was really looking forward to our experience at & Son, but unfortunately it was a very underwhelming one. The place is super clean and has a really cool vibe, but the food was mediocre at best. Our appetizers were great - the mac and cheese was amazing - but the steak was a bit on the dry side and the drinks were surprisingly expensive for the quality. The cheesecake dessert was a major disappointment, though - it was really bitter and gross. Our waitress was more than willing to comp us a dessert, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to salvage the experience. Overall, I'd say it's worth checking out if you're in the area, but I wouldn't recommend making a reservation in advance - we were definitely lucky to get a table on a busy night.",1
"First and last time I go to a TikTok viral restaurant. Once I saw people lined up outside I knew I should've turned around but I already put my car in a lot so I just went for it.It took about 20 minutes in line before I made it in the restaurant (I showed up around opening time). The design of the restaurant was cool and casual. Good for groups of 2 or 4. There is also bar area seating for the solo diners.  The menu is very limited, no names of wines are listed. Just ""red wine, rose, white wine"" and the specialty named, classic cocktails like martini and margarita. They also have a few beer selections. The menu is on the placemat they give you. I didn't realize until I was leaving the restaurant.  Basically they only serve one thing, skirt steak and you're only asked the temp you want it cooked. Dinner includes a salad and unlimited fries. ( I never got a refill of fries so I can't speak to how easy it actually is to get your plate refreshed). Anyways, if you only do one thing, I would expect that it would be done well however that wasn't the case. Everything looked well and juicy but it was near impossible to chew that meat. I gave up after trying to eat two pieces. My jaw hurt so much.  The salad and fries were good though, so I basically finished that and called it a loss. Also my martini was very strong, so kudos to the bartender. She was very busy but attentive. I would not return here.",0
"Overall, I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The wait was about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The only downside is that the venue is pretty small, seating only about 20 people at most. The food was good - I got the tontoro ramen, which is similar to the torigara just with the pork broth instead of chicken broth. Compared to the torigara, the tontoro is heavier with the chewy noodles. However, I wouldn't say it was too heavy that you feel awful after eating. The chasu pork was okay, but not extremely tender. The portion size was also good - it wasn't a lot, but enough given the density. They have some unique options - I tried the yuzu dashi that came with with thin straight noodles and it was very light. It had a very light yuzu taste in the broth. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Sushi on Jones. The market plate with all veggies was super filling and the vegetables were very flavorful. I especially enjoyed the peas and the mushrooms. The mac and cheese was also really delicious. The only downside was the restroom, which is through the kitchen and is very greasy on the floor.",1
"I stopped by Upside Pizza because I was hungry waiting for my other reservation, and there was a line so I said why not? They had great looking options, and I love mushroom pizza so that was my obvious choice. The staff was super friendly which I appreciated. This slice was tasty, but I definitely wish it had red sauce.I'd say that was the only thing the slice was missing. Other than that, the location was great, and there was a bunch of seating options. I'd come back for sure if I'm in the area!!",0
"Vanessa's Dumplings is a great place to get dumplings and pancakes in NYC. The restaurant has been renovated and looks more modern, but it's still a no-frills eatery: order at the register and pay. There's usually a lot of confusion among the staff here, and that's why I only go to takeout. The duck filling in my recent sandwich was way too salty, and there wasn't much of it in the sandwich itself. Next time, I'll just get a plain pancake sandwich. Between the carb calories and it being fried, it's a filling dish all by itself. The staff here seem stressed but they work fast. The ordering and pickup system needs work, though, because it's way too confusing and chaotic when the restaurant is packed. But you can call in your orders for pickup now, so there's progress.",1
"I originally came into this area to eat at a different spot but it happened to be closed so I decided to try this taco spot. I ordered the steak, chicken, and pork flour tacos with chips and guac. The tacos were pricier than some of my other favorite taco spots at avg around $4 per taco or more. I did however appreciate how each taco was wrapped allowing for easy eating without having to touch them with my bare fingers. My first impressions were that they were juicy and the meat was tender. It definitely packed a good amount of flavor but not enough to be wowed and take over as my new favorite taco joint. They were slightly overpriced imo and would rather go to other spots such as tacombi. The chips were also bland and not very memorable. I did however appreciate how fast and easy it was to order and they offered a nice seating area with shade.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The food was well packaged and arrived quickly. The place was cute and well-spaced out for customers, and the food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the shrimp quesadillas, the fish taco, and the birria tacos order of three, and all three were delicious. The shrimp was fresh and there was a generous serving of guac and salsa, while the fish taco was yummy and not over-fried. The birria tacos order of three was also great - it was consumed very quickly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"As most places I visit, Jacob's Pickles has been in my bookmarks for quite some time but I'm never in the area and haven't really had the opportunity to visit, until this past weekend. Ended up walking in without a reservation on a Sunday at about 7 pm and they were able to seat us in the patio area right away. Despite being an enclosed space, it was still a bit cold as it was only about 20° outside so we requested to move inside and just as we did, a table was leaving so we were able to be reseated quickly. I'm not sure the experience would have been as enjoyable had we stayed on the patio but that's neither here nor there.I ended up ordering a mint tea and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc which were both delightful. After settling in and reviewing the menu, we decided on the Buffalo Mac & Cheese and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Caesar Salad. Ok. Before I even get into the taste let me warn all of you that the portion sizes are out of this world. I was definitely not expecting two full huge chicken breast atop my Caesar salad but I was not the least bit upset when that's what was plated before me. The buffalo mac was absolutely phenomenal and the salad was delicious. We ended up taking most of it with us to-go because neither of us were hungry enough to finish it all but I'm already looking forward to returning and ordering a full (and humongous) entree off the menu.",0
"I was really excited to try out Dragon Sushi 83, as it was listed as a Seamless option. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as great as I had hoped. The delivery was on time, but the sushi was average at best. I ordered the Maki Boy Combo C-tuna, salmon, California Rolls for $15.95, Maki Boy Combo D-spicy kani, yellowtail jalapeno, salmon avocado for $17.95, 8 Piece Sashimi Appetizer ($11.95) and the Yellowtail Scallion Roll ($5.50). The Maki Boy Combos came with either a miso soup or salad ... we got one of each. The wasabi seems to have green food coloring added to it and the rolls in the Maki Boy Combo D were messily made (barely any rice on one side of the rolls). The chopsticks that were given to us were too short, so we had to use our own. We ended up eating all of our food, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped.",1
"If I were to ever move from New York City, I would be very sad to leave XFF - this restaurant is such a hidden gem and exclusive to our city! The seating is plentiful and the bathroom is always clean. I absolutely love their hand-pulled noodles - they're extra chewy and taste amazing with the chili oil from the pork burger. The lamb is also very tender and a favourite of mine. The only downside to this restaurant is that the spice level can be a bit too intense for some - go with the medium to extra hot if you're looking for more of a burn in your mouth! Overall, I always enjoy my visits to XFF and can't wait to come back soon.",1
"The Ukrainian restaurant was a great place to go with friends. The wait was not too long, and the seats were comfortable. The food was also great, with a variety of dishes to choose from. I especially liked the pierogis, which were served fried but still had a great texture. The side dishes were also great, with a variety of flavors and textures. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I ordered a large pie with half olives and half cheese from here and it was a pretty decent price. The olives were mostly left whole, which gave it a kind of rustic feel. Overall, the pizza is standard NY style cheese with very light tomato sauce. Because they're both in HK, I feel like this spot versus Casabianca, I'd prefer Casabianca because there's more cheese. It was fine for the price. Delivery came in time and I have no complaints other than ""I've had better for the price."" It's very acceptable standard pizza fare.",1
"I work at a hospital a few blocks away and have ordered for pickup a couple of times, no complaints so far! I've gotten what I assume to be a lunch special since it's only $11 and change for an entree and an appatizer. I've gotten the drunken noodles with vegetable dumplings and with steamed dumplings. My favorite so far were the steamed dumplings, they are quite big and taste fresh. The drunken noodles are very yummy- chewy, spicy, flavorful and with a lot of veggies and chicken. My order has always been ready when I've picked up and the staff is friendly. Good food for a great price, will probably be ordering from here again.",0
"3.5ish starsGem Bing Shop is a micro-sized eatery on St. Marks. it's a walkup from sidewalk to a small doorway that you just order from and your food is made in front of you. there's no tables or seating inside. there might be a table or two on the sidewalk but takeout is the name of the game. basically there's a menu explaining what a jianbing is and the menu options as well as some soft drinks. Gem Bing only accepts cash and venmo as payment. never had a jianbing before which is basically the only thing Gem Bing makes. i'd liken it to a crispy crepe sandwich for which you choose your fillings. apparently it's a street food in China. the basic jianbing is the crispy crepe lined with a sauce and then stuffed with thin layer of egg, a crunchy wafer, lettuce + (any additional fillings like spam, duck, more egg, pork, etc.  for an added cost). ordered the regular-sized jianbing ($8.99) with an add-on filling of crispy duck (+$3.99). your jianbing is made in front of you and take about 7-10 minutes. it's boxed and bagged neatly. how was it? pretty good--nice amount of crunch, decent amounts of savory duck along with the crisp lettuce and egg. the mix of textures and flavors make for an interesting bite. wasn't sure what to expect and i pretty much liked what i got. the price feels high bc the duck jianbing is basically a snack and runs about $12.98 + tax + tip. you can get a smaller size jianbing which is a couple dollars less. overall, it's worth a try if you have never had one. the service is pretty curt, outside of ordering. drops mic cuz jianbing for the wini outzzz",0
Specifically for the DUMBO TimeOut Market location:I was able to order ahead on the timeout app and just went over from our table to pick it up. Pizzas were satisfying as a snack with beers from the neighboring bar at the market. Mainly also only came here because the lines for julianas and grimaldis were too long,0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The service was prompt and polite, the food was fantastic and the outdoor seating area is great for dogs. We especially loved the deviled eggs, the pate, the burrata, the fish tacos and the oysters. The only downside was that our server didn't bring us a water bowl for our dog, but she did bring us a treat. Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"Perfect 10/10. I was feeling really down and needed to talk with a friend, he had recommended this place.I love cocktail bars and this place blew me away. Perfect servicePerfect environment Perfect Drinks. All of the drinks we got were recommendations, the bartenders know their craft well and engage with the people very politely.The place had great music, combined with the drinks, made my who week better!",0
The atmosphere is amazing. The drink was really good a margarita i got it less spicy. the black and white salt rim was super cool. The truffle fries and wings were good. I walked right in and was seated at a table top at the bar. My service was good! My fried asparagus was not cooked properly and i was unable to bite it. I would absolutely come back here and eat!!!,0
"I stopped by this restaurant on Saturday morning and was impressed with the variety of food they had to offer. I got the roasted pork puff, chicken puff, pork and cabbage bun, and a red bean pastry. All of the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick bite.",1
"I stopped by Traveleen's Thai Cuisine for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised! The food was delicious and very affordable. I had the vegetarian pad Thai, green curry and spring rolls and they all tasted great. The service was great, too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great Thai food at a great price.",1
"They have a lot of outdoor seating with individual heat lamps and good safety precautions. There are plastic barriers between each table and each table is relatively far apart. Servers have masks.Food was pretty good. Really loved the burger and fries which were savory and juicy. The chili was hearty and warming, with a lot of beef. Will skip the focaccia next time. $3 for one bite is a little ridiculous. Unfortunately the service leaves a lot to be desired and is really more like 1-2 stars for service. It took us a while to order and receive our food. Our server didn't check up on us for a long time and didn't let us know ahead of time that we pay by going up to the window so we sat around waiting for our check for a long time. Finally a different worker was handling seating and bathroom line and she was exceedingly rude and snapping at customers.",0
"I stopped by for brunch with a friend and the experience was well worth it! We didn't have a reservation, but the staff was kind enough to get us a table and offered really great suggestions for food and drinks. I would recommend the rum punch for sure if you're looking for a good time!",0
"UMMMMM FIRST OF ALL. PANTIES DROPPED. SECOND OF ALL. HOLD MY ""PONI"" TAIL. THIRD OF ALL. HOLD MY DRINK. I had dinner with a friend at the restaurant upstairs. Since she is vegetarian I was looking for a nice restaurant that serves impossible burgers since we are both a fan. I discovered this place from looking at the Instagram of Saxon + Parole (restaurant upstairs). The Poni room is a completely different world from the restaurant. You go downstairs and you open the curtain and it is like a pink inspired room. You go in and you have the chance to pick your drink in this special room. They have wine, cider, rose, froze, you can have pitchers and they have small bites. My friend and I tried one of their beers and ordered the fried cassava chips with this spicy sauce. GIRL. This place brought me back to life. Such a good place to have drinks with your girls after a workweek or even with a group of people and just order small bites and share and order pitchers of rose. The place closes at 11 so it's not a typical new york place that opens late but it's a good spot to start the evening. Definitely a must go and see! Such a cool atmosphere, great service, place is super clean and just a great time!",0
"PF Chang's To Go is a great option for those looking for a quick and easy meal. The spicy chicken bowl is delicious, and the white rice is always a nice touch. The only downside is that they do not serve hot and sour soup, which is my favorite dish. Overall, PF Chang's To Go is a great choice for those looking for a tasty and convenient meal.",1
"Recently had the chance to try Jean-Georges.  It is located on the west side, near Columbus Circle.The restaurant is classically decorated, with low lighting, and lots of dark coloring.  Service was great.I tried the following dishes:Toasted Egg Yolk (5/5): Definitely the best and most interesting dish we had.  The egg yolk was meant to taste like a grilled cheese, and it did exactly that.  Loved it.Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons (3.5/5): A standard tuna dish that I have had before.  However, the fish was fresh and flavorful.Madai Sashimi (4/5): I absolutely love madai, and this one was no different.  However, it was pretty standard, and I have had better madai elsewhere.Chitarra Pasta (4/5): A nice pasta with butter and truffles.  Really well-cooked, rich, and tasty.Crispy Black Bass (3.5/5): An okay bass.  It was cooked well, a little lacking in flavor, but overall good.Arctic Char (4/5): Really nice char.  It was cooked perfectly and flavored so well.Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at Jean-Georges.  While some of the dishes were not super original, there were definitely a couple of standouts.  I would definitely return to eat again!",0
"I wasn't completely blown away by the food here, but it was certainly very satisfactory and very affordable for midtown. I work a block away, but only visited for the first time on Saturday... Seems like I've been missing out on the awesome lunch specials! I feel like I don't eat Indian enough to judge the authenticity of the food, but I'd consider it that.Around 5pm, our party of 3 was seated immediately. Cozy vibes. Definitely got busier (and darker) by the time we left, with a few people waiting for tables. We got the free basket of naan (courtesy of yelp check-in) which paired well with the Chicken Korma ($16). The chicken korma tasted like standard curry to me ... whatever that means lol. Maybe we should've gotten it a tad spicier, but it was a good, typical comfort dish.You bet we ordered the garlic naan ($3.50) as well -- it is of course the go-to, must-order. Did not disappoint! And I might have burned my tongue a bit from the vegetable samosa ($3) but it was worth it. Would like to try the lamb/pea one next time! No complaints about the mango lassi ($4) - refreshing and delicious, as it should be. Lastly, the Lamb Biryani ($17) was just *chef's kiss* -- this was plenty of food to share between 3 people, and I'd return for lunch to satisfy any future Indian cravings!",0
"This is a traditional trendy elegant contemporary restaurant located in Columbus Circle Time Warner Building. My first and only experience was not the best. I was meeting a client for lunch and I only ordered a Shrimp Salad for lunch. It seemed they provided one jumbo shrimp, then cut into as many pieces as possible, then placed on a slim salad. That was not a great beginning. However, I believe this restaurant deserves a second visit next time I am in the area. I will probably order a steak, but will most definitely order the same shrimp salad to determine if my last visit was an off day.",0
"Our group picked this restaurant because they had been to the original one in London. General consensus was that the London one was a lot better. This restaurant has some really nice design and the aesthetic was super nice. Lots of green, plants, and sunlight. They must also be good at marketing because they suckered all of us into getting $7 teas. The tea was literally just some mint or ginger in water, but since they had such a large variety (it took up a whole page of menu,) we had to pick one each for ourselves. The food was okay- my veggie burger was $20 and the burger itself was dry. Vegan sticky toffee pudding was good, stuck to their London roots. Vegan food can be overpriced, but the taste wasn't out of this world to justify the cost.",0
"The Lavaux is a terrible restaurant. I only had drinks here and the experience was bad enough to leave. I came with a party of 6 and the place was completely empty. I was excited to see they had wine flights. We planned to order 1 flight to taste and then order full glasses or bottles, but the waiter said we couldn't do that and that we had to order 1 flight per person. I explained our intentions, but he said it was restaurant rules and that we couldn't share them. What kind of restaurant decides what I can or cannot order? Or what I can or cannot do with what I order? I felt insulted, like they are trying to make sure I spend money here.

The service wasn't good either. The waiter stayed behind the counter the entire time, almost in a lazy way, instead of coming to the table to ask us what we wanted... and the place was completely empty. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.",1
"After visiting Peppercorn Station a few weeks ago, the management team kindly reached out to learn how they could improve, which I highly respected. Decided to give it another try and order some of their other dishes from the expansive menu. This time around, we ordered: beef in sour pickle soup, sautéed pea shoots, dry chili fried chicken, and fried rice with black truffle. Honestly speaking, I felt that this time around the dishes were a lot more stronger in flavour, closer to what it would be like in Sichuan, my hometown. -Beef in sour pickle soup: the beef was tender, and the additional parts of it involved pickled Chinese radish, cucumber, and enoki mushroom. It was hard not to keep going for this as it was also just slightly spicy but sour enough that kept your tastebuds wanting more. -Sauteed pea shoots: as expected, the lighter dish of the meal to balance out everything else that's spicier and heavier in flavour. -Dry chili fried chicken: personally not my go-to order, but what surprised me was the ma Hua (fried dough twist) inside! That's such a childhood staple/snack that surprisingly went great with the dish. It's filled with lots off dry chili pepper, so you really have to dig around for the chicken. -Fried rice with black truffle: probably my favourite dish of this meal! The moment it was placed in front of us, you could distinctly smell the truffle, and despite it being added to a more traditional fried rice dish, only served to complement it. It was great to have this dish too with the beef and chicken to balance the whole meal out a bit. Again, had to go for the bing fen dessert. I'd say that because Peppercorn Station has so many items on their menu, definitely try give them more of a try to get the holistic picture. It's nice to have this authentic restaurant tucked away in such a central location of the city.",0
"My partner and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. We were seated at a table and shortly after served complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was very chunky and the tomatoes tasted fresh and had that homemade quality to it which I loved. It was our first time here and I was going to order tacos but our waiter suggested the birria quesadilla. It wasn't on the menu or advertised anywhere but our waiter suggested it and mentioned that it was their special of the day. I decided to get that instead as it sounded like a better deal as it came with consome and was $2 cheaper than the tacos I was going to order, and wow am I glad I did! My partner and I really liked the consome. It did come with carrots which I thought was a weird addition but it still tasted very rich and flavorful. The quesadilla was the right amount of cheesy and also super flavorful. We also got the bay street corn which tasted great but could've been a tad creamier. The reason I took off one star is because, when we were seated, we were shown to a table and when we requested a booth, we were told that Friday nights are usually busy so they couldn't give us a booth. There were only a few other tables being served when we arrived and literally every booth in the restaurant was empty. Plus, two couples came in shortly after we were seated and they both were given booths! Even though the service was great otherwise, that one thing was pretty annoying.",0
"We had a mixed experience here and I don't see myself coming back.We got a table right away at 7pm on a Friday night and started with appetizers. The mozzarella sticks and bruschetta were delicious. The Caesar salad was good, except the anchovies were insanely salty so we had to push them to the side of the plate.I got carbonara and it was alright, I have definitely had better. My friend had the meatballs and said it was just okay. She didn't even want to take them home. My other friend had the spinach ravioli and also said they were just fine, nothing special. My friends had the special ravioli with an assortment of lobster, spinach, and some other kind of ravioli in vodka sauce and they thought it was pretty decent. My bf had the cacio de Pepe and it was horrible. It had probably 3x as much black pepper as it needed. I tried it and there were so many big chunks of black pepper everywhere. It was so overboard and unappetizing. Almost inedible.The wait staff was nice to us but we are pretty sure they completely forgot to put in our dinner order. We waited a good 30 minutes after our appetizers came for our entrees until we noticed tables who arrived after us were getting their food. I asked the waiter when our food will come and he looked nervous and simply said ""soon"". Our food came out 10 minutes later. Yeah I don't think he put in the ticket at all.Had high hopes but would not return sadly",0
I'm so happy that NR is still operating despite the pandemic. Food is still INCREDIBLE and their service is on point. Delivery was LIGHTNING fast even on a rainy day. I hope they continue to thrive and survive these tough times,0
"I had a great time at Carbonara! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. I also really enjoyed the carbonara sauce on the pasta. The only downside was that the Cacio e peppe wasn't as good as the carbonara. The oysters were also delicious. The drinks were nice and bubbly for brunch. Overall, I can't wait to come back!",1
"The RH Rooftop Restaurant has beautiful decor, but the lack of cocktails detracted from my experience. The lobster roll was disappointing, as was the service. Overall, I'm not sure I'd visit again.",1
The food was alright. The arepas are fried and didn't seem typical to Venezuelan arepas I've had in the past but it was a good quick stop for some tasty food! It's a very small interior and the presentation isn't amazing but the food was good enough. I would go here again on my own but I probably wouldn't recommend to anyone visiting from out of town as it isn't a special place and there isn't anything extraordinary about it. The juice was great!,0
"Amazing Italian food and great outdoor seating! I've passed by this place a ton of times and every time I passed by, the outdoor seating reminded me of Italy and enticed me to want to try this place. I was hesitant to try this location at first due to some of the reviews, so I tried their 7th Avenue location first due to the better reviews. But I personally liked this location a lot better.  I'm so glad I decided to give this place a shot because the food we ordered was amazing. Starting from the perfectly fried Calamari and octopus to the delicious dipping marinara sauce to our pastas. We ordered the linguine con pescatore which is a seafood linguine in their home made tomato sauce and the rigatoni alla vodka. Both were spectacular. The sauce was good everything and made every dish better! Service, however was a bit underwhelming. Our server barely came to check up on us, until the very last maybe 30 mins or so after our pasta was served. Overall, great ambience, good food, and great location. Will definitely one back.",0
"I stopped in one Saturday for lunch and I was happy with my choice.  Service is fast, the facilities are clean.  I had their miso soup, which was on the good side of average as well as a spicy tuna roll.  It was also delicious and it was more than enough food.  I left satisfied and would definitely return to try other items.",1
"My friend and I were looking for somewhere to have a late lunch after visiting the Cooper Hewitt museum, and we came across Lolita's in our research. It was pretty empty and we were allowed to seat ourselves outside. The menu on the website was a bit different than the one we were given, which threw us off. My friend ordered a well done guacamole burger and I got a medium California burger, which both came with a cute metallic basket of fries! The burgers themselves were pretty solid, but I found it interesting that both of our patties were definitely well done. The cutting board that the burger and fries were served on was unique, but I found that it didn't serve its purpose as well as a plate. The service was also not bad, but we were never checked on, and therefore our water wasn't refilled despite it being a hot day outside.",0
"Wo Hop is a restaurant that always delivers on its food. This visit was no exception! The dishes were fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I would highly recommend Wo Hop to anyone looking for a fantastic meal.",1
"Rating on food alone  Los Tacos No 1 would earn a 5 star review from me. However my experience was a little stressful, but also a very New York experience :My son's teacher (in Georgia) recommended it and we decided to try it on the way to a show. Takeaway #1 do not eat tacos before broadway especially if there is a mask mandate in effect. But I digress.......As we arrived the line was really growing. There were A LOT of people behind us. We were the last people to get in line inside of the restaurant. It was winter and we had hats and coats and gloves, and phones and you get the idea. I was wearing a mask the man taking my order was wearing a mask. It was hard to understand and never having been there I was having a hard time managing all of my winter gear, my purse, wallet, credit card....... a bit like I was in Seinfeld's soup nazi episode. I got a bit flustered at the register. There were things being handed to my already full hands. Takeaway 2......be ready! The menu is simple. Plan ahead!Now to the food. Wow. Fresh. Delish. I had 1 polloAsada and one adobada (pork) taco. My son had carne asada, so I got to try all three meats. Thr adobada was my favorite. Definitely worth the line and the fumbling with all my belongings. Quite a good find for fresh, authentic tastes.The next thing.....this restaurant may not be for grandma. Great food but you eat standing up. It was fine for us, even though I am a grandma, but my mom could not manage the standing and eating portion of this restaurant. Honestly, if I had it to do again I would probably get carry out and eat it somewhere else.Next time I am in NYC I will visit Los Tacos No 1 and order like a pro.",0
"Cho Dang Gol is a great spot for Korean food in Manhattan K-Town. The restaurant is cozy and authentic, and the food is really unique. I really enjoyed the tofu dishes here, and the banchan (side dishes) were also great. The wait for a party of two was around 30 minutes, but it was worth it because the food was so good. I would definitely recommend coming here for a meal.",1
"My partner and I  have been patrons and big fans of The Smith's brunch for years. With takeout as the only option available to us right now, we decided to take advantage of the nice weather and walk to the Midtown location for pickup. As other Yelpers have mentioned, their ""Brunch for 2"" option is reasonable and offers a limited listed of classic favorites: 2 entrees, 2 sides and 2 cocktails/juice. All the food was excellent and the cocktails were very cutely packed in jam jars. It was perfect for a Sunday brunch on the patio (see pic). We got the Shrimp and Grits, The Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Jalapeno Grits, Bacon, a Mimosa and a Bloody Mary.",0
"Smith & Wollensky definitely has its classic steakhouse appeal - the decor is classic and the service is excellent. However, it can be quite noisy inside, so it's not the best place to go if you're looking for a quiet meal. The steaks are definitely good, and the creamed spinach is a real standout dish. Overall, it's a great choice for a special occasion.",1
"Nah... We were cool with the tasting menu even though we had called ahead and let them know we didn't want the shellfish BUT we also didn't want the shellfish to be replaced by a vegetarian dish. Which they assured us they could do, but then proceeded to replace the shellfish... with a vegetarian dish.  But we were even fine with that because the replacement wasn't too bad. In fact we were fine with the entire meal up until the entree came.Have you ever seen that episode of ""Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" where Charlie asks for ""milk steak boiled over hard"". Yeah that's what it tasted like- a boiled steak. Which is a long-winded of saying, don't serve boiled (sous vide) steak. Which is an even longer-winded way of saying we hated the steak...Which made us not like this restaurant... Don't mess up steak.",0
"Not the worst pho I've had, but also definitely not the best. Our party of 8 dropped by during off hours (around ~1:30pm on a Thursday), and we were seated immediately. The server was kind, patient, and very diligent about refilling our waters! While the pho had a good flavor, it was on the oilier side. And its definitely a bit more expensive than other places in NYC. I didn't have any appetizers or dessert, but the bowl was big enough to fill me up (and still leave some noodles in the plate).",0
"La Pecora Bianca is a great place to go for lunch. The outdoor seating is really nice and the service was great. Our only complaint is that the steak was a bit overcooked, but it was still enjoyable. The pasta dish that one of our party members ordered was also really good. Overall, we had a great experience at La Pecora Bianca and would definitely recommend it.",1
"I came here during lunch hours and there was a short wait. However, it was well worth the wait!I got their lunch special that allows you to choose one main dish a side dish. I got the tonchin classic tokyo tonkotsu ramen and the spicy mayo chashu rice ball. It is a pretty great deal for the amount of food you get because I was bursting at the seams by the end of lunch. The rice ball was a delight- super delicious and flavorful. A great little appetizer! The ramen itself was very deep in flavor and was perfect for the rainy day. Was worried my visit to Japan would ruin ramen for me, but this place was absolutely amazing. 100% would come back again!",0
"I went here for dinner when they first reopened indoor dining. Tables were far apart and it was pretty empty since it was a weekday! I didn't feel unsafe and they have a barcode to scan for the menu. I absolutely loved the oxtail croquettes. I'm such a big fan of oxtail but the real seller was the chutney it came with. The crispy, savory flavor of the croquettes combined with the sweetness of the chutney was a great combination.  I had the black rice seafood paella as my main course, which was delicious. I would totally recommend this dish to anyone who comes here.",0
"I had a great time at Holly Cow! The food was really good and there was a good variety. The service was friendly and there was no wait to be served. However, the prices were really high. I paid $26.50 for a bowl of salmon and 2 veggies, and I could have gotten the same thing at a much lower price at a restaurant like Subway.",1
"It's a small store front that has one large table. Couple of seatings near the window and close to the walls. We ordered a California burrito and by our surprise there was French fries inside it! Additionally, we ordered fish taco and Cobb salad with steak. The salad was drenched with the citrus dressing which makes it extremely appetizing, it was a good portion size too!! The fish taco breading batter was light and airy which was a nice surprise. Next time I would definitely come back to try the quesadilla!!!",0
"This restaurant is well set up for outdoors dining. There were a lot of tables with a lot of space. The waitstaff seemed to be spread a bit thin. This was OK because it allowed our meal to proceed at a leisurely pace. Cocktails and wine by the glass were good. The salads were excellent. My wife really liked her branzino. My salmon burger Wes OK. The frites were very good. The cappuccino was a bit watery.  Nice place for a meal.  3.5 stars, rounded up for the pandemic.",0
The Dutch is a great place for coffee and pastries. The service is excellent and the venue is clean and open. I can't wait to get back for brunch or some eats!,1
"Whipped ricotta was 3.5/5 - a little bland , but the bread was tasty. Brussels salad was well seasoned and very tasty - 4/5. Gramigna - 3.5/5 dominant flavor is pesto. Could've used a little spice. Rigatoni - 4.5/5 best dish on the menu! I would've preferred a protein on it, but very flavorful. Scallops - 5/5 I really liked the flavor and that it wasn't overly carb heavy. Really great! Tiramisu was HUGE! Definitely enough for at least 4 people.",0
Food was delicious and service was great . Hot tea took a while to come out but that was alright . Meat tasted fresh. We ordered the love set for four and it was so much food. We couldn't finish all of it.,0
"I was really disappointed at Mari, from the service to food. Nothing wows me here. The prices are definitely high, but I don't think the quality is worth it. It's a lot of wait between each course, which can be frustrating, and the food is mostly just soy sauce marinated items. The ""summer truffle"" they use is the size of the potato that I had never seen, but there's no fragrance at all. Overall, I don't think this is a great choice if you're looking for a special dining experience.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! It's located in a great spot - right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The staff was really nice and our table was ready right when we arrived. I ordered the mushroom/truffle flatbread, fried calamari, the pretzel, the nachos and Korean lettuce wraps. The mushroom/truffle flatbread was my favorite - it was very delicious. The fried calamari was also really good. I didn't love the pretzel as much as the others, but it was still good. The nachos were really good too - I especially loved the cheese sauce. The Korean lettuce wraps were also really good - I loved the flavor of the soy sauce. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and I would definitely come back.",1
"Not bad, not great. I am not a fan of dark restaurants so I didn't enjoy the atmosphere at all but when I am with my vegan daughter we give her all the food options. Tasty but nothing to write home about.",0
"The chengdu dan dan noodles were good. It was very flavorful. The Sichuan Chilled Noodles were my least favorite, I didn't really care for the texture of the noodles. When you bite into it they kind of clump together in your mouth? I didn't really like that. And the crispy chicken was okay, the chicken was a bit dry.",1
"BaoHaus is a great place to go for a quick bite and some good old-fashioned hip hop vibes. The seating is limited, so be prepared to take it to-go or eat outside if it's busy, but the food is definitely worth it. My favorite dish was the chairman's pork belly, which was tender, fatty, and delicious. The spiciness wasn't overpowering, but the sauce added a creamy texture to the bite, which elevated it versus the non-spicy. The pickled cabbage and crushed peanuts added a nice crunch factor, which equated to a well-rounded bite. Overall, a great place to catch a vibe and eat some delicious food.",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. The decor was very elegant, and the atmosphere was quiet in the beginning and then turned louder when more people came in. The food was good, especially their signature beef courses, except for the beef sushi I'm not a huge fan. The dessert the green tea tiramisu was yummy. The only downside for the whole experience was service being very slow, because they obviously were short in staff. The whole dining room with around 10 tables there were only 2 servers and 1 bartender. The waiter that was serving us also responsible for at least 4 more tables with greeting people, serving food, getting the pot for sukiyaki ready, explaining food, preparing checks, etc. He was very committed but super busy - he almost ran back and forth. He did a great job though the management should consider adding more staff. Our whole dinner took almost 2.5 hours vs the expected 1.5 hours.",1
"I had a great time at Hillstone restaurant! The Tequila mockingbird cocktail was amazing and I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu. My other favorite dish was the Fluke crudo - it was so fresh and delicious. I also really enjoyed the Estrella (chicken liver pasta) - it was a nice change of pace from the typical pasta dishes I'm used to. The duck was also good, but I didn't love it as much as the others. The pear crisp was my favorite dessert, though - it was so tasty and I loved the addition of fruit. Overall, I would definitely recommend Hillstone to anyone looking for a good meal. 4.5 stars.",1
"I had a great time at 108 Dry Hot Pot. The food was delicious and the service was great. It's a bit on the pricier side, but it's definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good quick lunch. The boba shop inside is also a nice bonus.",1
"Came here on a Friday night around 8pm and was told a table would be 20-30 mins. Once we sat down the service was incredibly quick which was great because we were hungry! I ordered a steak, chorizo and carnitas taco and by far the steak one was my favorite! Super flavorful and SPICY! They also bring out free chips and salsa for the table. This is a great spot for some cheap authentic Mexican food. Will be back!",0
"The concept of this restaurant is really cool - it's like a food feast for the eyes. But unfortunately, I wasn't really impressed with the food. I got an empanada and it wasn't really that great. I'm definitely going back to try some of the other dishes, but I need to be more impressed first.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was really good and the prices were really affordable. I especially loved the soup dumplings - they were the best I've ever had. The only downside was the service - it was really slow and the guy who was serving us didn't seem to care very much about us. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"my experience - there are two XO locations which are not too far apart from one another. they expanded it because it is a popular place in NYC chinatown. the people are as expected, you're in chinatown and the service will not be top-notch, but we are here to talk about the food! there was a wait for about 30-40 minutes when we got there for a table of 7 people on a saturday for lunch. menu - i think it's great that they have such a huge variety in their food and dishes. there is not a single person that can come in here without finding something they enjoy. food -i think their food is average. there is nothing in particular that tastes super great but it's a quick and easy cantonese style cafe. it's comfort food for a lot of people. we ordered a lot of dishes and the ones that stuck out to me were the XO style turnip cake as well as the japanese fried dumplings. i would give it a try if you're in for some comfort food, but don't have super high expectations.",0
"Food is quite mediocre and greasy. We ordered fried chicken wings with original and soy garlic, steamed tofu with sautéed kimchi, short ribs and sautéed vegetables. fried chicken with original sauce tastes bland and greasy. I wouldn't recommend ordering it.",0
"Better than expected!We've been here for HH and it was really good but didn't think that brunch would be that good. Happy for that!Sunday brunch around 2pm, not pack at all but busy and super kids/baby friendly.We were accomodated in no time woth a soace for the stroller (baby was sleeping)We noticed that there was a big group of parents with babies and all they accomodated them as well (with several high chairs and space for 3 strollers!). So really recommending it for a boozy brunch with friends!We has a breads basket as appetizer, a bruger, benedicts and brooklyn blackout cake. A bloodymary for each of us.YUM!!!Bread basket/pastries basket was ok, bit pricey maybe. Cornbread and croissant were spectacular but the other two muffins meh.Burger came medium rare as ordered, super juicy with a side of fries and real onion rings yummy.Benedict was ordered with salmon and it was really good too.Cake was good too, came with a vanilla ice creamW come back!",0
"Absolutely DELICIOUS! Remember people, vegan food is FOOD. You don't have to be Vegan to enjoy it. Quesadillas, nachos, and the burger were all banging. Washed it down with some home made passion fruit juice. Sad I don't have many pictures as I would like as we ate everything so quickly. All they need is a dining area and they are set. Can't wait to try more items on the menu!",0
"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The noodles are really cheap, but I can see why. Everything else is just small pieces of food that a cat could easily eat. I don't recommend this place.",1
"JG has become our annual Valentine's Day dinner restaurant. However, this time we had to enjoy take out because of the pandemic. I definitely missed the atmosphere but dinner at home was still amazing. Also, everything was packaged great. Hands down the best take out presentation.TUNA TARTARE - I am not a fan of raw food but this was very fresh and easy to eat.  MUSHROOM RISOTTO - My least favorite dish simply because of the mushy / chewy texture but the flavor was great. Can't go wrong with truffles.PEPPERCORN STEAK - The steak was so tender and juicy even after I heated it up. I loved the sriracha sauce but it was definitely very spicy. I recommend using it sparingly if you shy away from spice. STEAMED BASS - This dish was simply cooked fish, with minimal seasoning. It was good, just not a "" WOW "" like the other dishes. PETIT GATEAUX - AMAZINGGGGG !!!!!! That's all.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was okay. The fried mountain yam was definitely a standout, but some of the other dishes were a bit lackluster. I think for the same price, there are better options in the city.",1
"I had an amazing time at Flor de Mayo! The food was amazing and the service was great. I really loved how they recognized their audience and made me feel like family. Even with Covid restrictions, they are still the best!",1
Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes or maybe they just don't put in all the bad salty stuff that other restaurants use (which in that case i would be happy ). Ordered broccoli and hot and sour soup and it was okay. I think I will give another chance.,0
"I had a great experience at this BBQ restaurant - the food was delicious and the staff was friendly and welcoming. It was great to have the same BBQ taste at a convenient location near Times Square, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great BBQ meal.",1
"Came here with my friends for dinner on a Wednesday around 6:30pm. Wasn't too crowded and quickly got a table for 3 outdoors. Decent food and a relatively good price for the area. Wouldn't recommend eating in though as I didn't really like the dining area.In terms of seating for COVID, there are a few tables outdoors with plastic barriers between the tables that are right next to each other. There was a small space between our table and the table next to ours (2 feet or so) without any plastic barrier between, which was a little alarming. The plants next to us also attracted an alarming number of flies, which was annoying as we were trying to eat. I ordered the drunken noodles with tofu while my friends got pho and the duck noodles. We also had a calamari appetizer to share. The calamari was amazing, with a wonderful crisp outside and great flavoring but was very small for its price. I think it'd be the perfect size for two people max (though I could easily finish one on my own). The drunken noodles were well flavored and the tofu was well cooked and coated in sauce while maintaining a juicy interior (which is actually harder to get than I'd expect). I didn't try the other dishes but my friends both said they were pleasantly surprised by the place. Overall, think the food is pretty good and a decent price point. I would probably recommend ordering these dishes for takeout to avoid the flies/ close seating though.",0
We ordered 2 gluten free pizzas to go.  The margarita and Ribalta. Both were good although the broccoli rabe on the Ribalta was very bitter. The balance was off as we felt there wasn't enough white sauce and cheese and too much broccoli rabe.  Overall though the quality was good  and we would come back.,0
"My friend and I came for restaurant week and since I had some time to kill, I decided to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine. The bartender was super friendly and kind and I loved the Rose wine I ordered. The restaurant was pretty empty when my friend and I sat down for dinner, and the food came out quickly. I ordered the white bean soup and the pasta while my friend ordered the arugula salad and the roast chicken. I thought what I ordered was okay, but nothing amazing though my friend seemed to really like their food. Our waiter was nice, but it took a while to get the check. I might come back but just to grab a drink at the bar and  not for the food.",0
"My friend who hails from San Diego recommended Tacombi, and I always trust a southern Californian to suggest good Mexican food. With reasonable prices, an enticing vegetarian-friendly menu, and fun industrial space with high ceilings, I've become a semi-regular here.I like to start with a their margarita with combier - and sub out standard tequila for mezcal. It's a solid (not amazing) margarita, and they go down easily. I love the gringa quesadilla, with juicy al pastor pork. I like to add their dark smoky salsa to it, and they've always accommodated my fussy request to hold the cilantro (soap!) and raw onions. Guacamole is another strong point.The service has always been great too, with diligent waitstaff and super quick turnaround on the food.",0
*4.5/5Take me back!!! Finally some cheap (but not nasty) alc!! 212 Hisae's officially got me hooked on amaretto sours. The line is long on a weekend night but it's worth if you tryna have fun but not break the bank. My teenage brother can make a way better kimchi fried rice than the one I ordered but no one comes here for the cuisine anyways. Fries were good tho. Pairs great w the $3 shots here. I want to go back,0
"Solid experience. First the great: the chicken was cooked perfectly. I ordered lunch gen tso chicken and it was crispy on the outside, yet juicy on the inside. I was SO happy with the chicken for every bite. The rice was good too. Regarding the gen tso chicken, it said spicy on the menu, but i just didn't get any spice other than a few chilies thrown in. It was more of a sweet flavor. Also, the egg drop soup was alright but not as good as others I've had. Appreciate how they give packet of chowmein noodles with the soup. Really made it better. An overall good experience, but will likely stick to other cheaper spots.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The pizza was delicious, and I loved the grandma style pie. The vodka pie was also very good, and the chili flakes added a nice kick. The cocktails were also delicious, and I would definitely come back here.",1
Overprice but definitely a nice places for girls to hang out. I was disappointed that they don't have the happy hour menu anymore. The dishes was creative and beautifully demonstrate especially the egg waffles which is not too sweet. The drinks can be lack of flavors if you don't mixed it well. Probably I will come back again if I am around the area.,0
"I was quite surprised by the rating given to this restaurant, but to each their own. I went on Grubhub looking for delivery and ran across this place. I decided to give it a try and ordered a Loco Moco bowl and was very satisfied with the dish! It reminds me of like Salisbury steak with rice, sunny side up eggs, with corn. Definitely will get food from here again in the future.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by my takeout dish from here. I ordered the chicken kottu roti and it was delicious. It was familiar, yet unique and had just the right amount of spice to it. I liked that the mixture of ingredients and slight variations in texture. The curry sauce on the side was so good. I would definitely come back and get this dish again, as well as their other offerings! Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The seating is spacious and comfortable, and our server was very friendly and helpful. They now offer sparkling or still water (complimentary), which was a nice plus. The brunch menu did have a few changes, primarily the addition of a Monkey Bread and crepes, and the removal of the Brioche French Toast and pasta options. I will note that the biscuits and gravy now come with a side of eggs which made me very happy - the price is still less than $17 but now you get 3 eggs (cooked to-order) and the biscuits how have a chive-based seasoning, which I actually prefer. This would still be my go-to order here. The sausage is pretty well-done and just a TAD dry but the gravy is still sublime (yes there is sausage in it as well!). We also tried the French Dip, which was very solid and came with a side of perfectly crispy fries. The portion is very generous so it will easily feed 2 if you get an app or another side. The monkey bread was okay - basically a large cinnamon roll comprised of pull-apart rolls and a icing glaze. We saved ours for ""dessert""! Overall, I had a great experience and",1
Came here for a drink before headed to Caroline's for a comedy show.  I had the Tailor of Panama along with the Scallops.  I wish I took a picture of the scallops because they were SO delicious. The drink was as well.  Yelp reviewers were pretty much on target with the reviews despite it being in a heavily tourist area. I'll be back for brunch on my next visit.,0
"The service here was terrible. We didn't even get our drinks for a full 20 minutes, and when we finally got them, they were cold. We had to wait another 15 minutes for our food, and when it finally arrived, we were charged for the biscuits. Overall, this was a very disappointing experience.",1
"Visited here twice during my stay in NY.  First time was at Saturday brunch.  Had the Holla Pain Yo! marg (good flavor/spice) and guacamole which was good because you can customize it -- I used all the ingredients; in my opinion, there wasn't enough to leave out as surplus, ratio-wise.  Service was decent, it was super busy -- the girl waiting on us would just say ""I'll just come back to you!"" if we weren't immediately ready, which I found to be slightly grating.  The second time, tonight, my bf and I came during happy hour.  Bar service is friendlier in my opinion and this place is always SUPER busy.  Pro tip: please ensure TP is well stocked in your bathrooms, some girls and I had to pass around tissue!",0
Went for Brunch yesterday and was super underwhelmed by both the food and service. Been to Cuba and all over Asia and familiar with the diversity of their respective cuisine.There was nothing authentic about this place. All dishes were bland and were just ok. Coffee was served cold . Wait service was lackluster; drinks were below average.I brunch almost every Sunday and this place does not meet the mark.,0
"I was hopeful about this place from Yelp but was disappointed by the food. I ordered for pickup--4 tacos (chicken, carnitas, carne asada, al pastor), elote (the corn of the cob topped with traditional spices) and a side of guacamole. The tacos looked good (have the traditional cotija cheese, came with slices of lime & radish) but the meat was just flavorless, plus there were no other veggies so it was all very bland except for the al pastor (which only had some flavor due to the pineapple). The elote was good but not the best food for takeout as all the toppings just get smeared on the foil rather than staying on the corn. Guacamole was all right but not amazing. Overall there are much better places as far as tacos are concerned.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The shrimp cocktail was delicious and the bone in strip loin was cooked perfectly. The service was great, too. I would definitely come back and recommend it to others!",1
"I went there to meet a friend for a drink and a light bite - it was fine. We were able to sit down and have a quiet area to chat. I had a yelp offer which allowed me to have spring rolls ""on the house."" My friend ordered a meal and a glass of wine.The restaurant is clean so that's important to me. The waitstaff was pleasant and we were able to get in/out in about an hour (which is all I had to spare that day). It's near Bloomingdales so you can make an afternoon out of it - shopping and dining! Why not? It is a decent Asian place that will not break the bank!",0
"I stopped by Eatily in Flatiron today for some fresh pasta and sauces. The store was relatively quiet and the overcast day made it easy to shop. There were 5 stats available for pasta, including homemade sauces. The selection of olive oil was great, with some from Italy and some from Sicily. There was also a great selection of chocolates and imported foods, ranging from chocolate to Italian tomatoes.

The nextdoor Earily Italian wine store was amazing. Frankie was very helpful and pointed me to a noce Tiscan wine, one of Italy's most popular wine types. I even found two move Gavi wines to try. The staff at Earily were all very nice, making the visit twice as nice. The bread at Eatily was more commercial-style than a local bakery, but the kitchen serving plates and bowls were from Italy, which made it worth visiting.",1
"I came here with a couple of friends after a show at Carnegie Hall. It has a bit of a neighborhood bar feel. Not quite a dive bar, but definitely no frills or fuss. Their cocktail menu didn't have any signature drinks, just the classics. I loved the boldness of listing the long island iced tea as the first item on the menu. I had a glass of the house wine. They were very heavy with the pour which was much appreciated. My friend got the house sparkling wine and it was also a generous pour. I didn't eat but my friends had the sliders and chipotle ranch chicken sandwich and enjoyed them. Our waitress was not super attentive, but service was fast. Nothing really special here but nothing to fault either. It's conveniently located near the NQR so it's a decent option if you're in the neighborhood.",0
"My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to have dinner on our trip to New York. Thanks to Yelp, we found Club A Steakhouse. It was a lot of good reviews so we decided to try it. When we went, it also happened to be restaurant week. I ordered the caesar salad, filet mignon, and cheesecake. The salad was delicious. The filet was quite a large cut for petite and tasted perfect. My boyfriend kept commented he would have also gotten that if he knew it would have been such a generous portion. I also don't really like cheesecake that much but this one was very very good. My boyfriend ordered the steak tartare which he has always wanted to try. He said the best place to try would be a steakhouse, and he as not disappointed. He liked his hangar steak. He said he liked my cheesecake better than his profiteroles though. Our waiter was very very nice and the ambiance of the place was beautiful. I have nothing bad to say about this place and I loved it. We had an excellent dinner here and I'm glad we went!",0
"Overall, our experience at this restaurant was not great. The service was slow, and the food was not particularly good. We were not particularly happy with our meals, either. The value of the dishes we ordered was not particularly high, either. We would not recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. My spicy pepperoni was cold and I asked for it to be reheated, but it still wasn't warm. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"I came here with my girlfriend to try out the famous noodle soup! Be sure to bring cash with you because this is a cash-only place, so make sure you have enough for the meal and tip!The Service: The people working here were pretty nice and gave us tea since it's a frigid day.  They mainly communicate in Mandarin but know a little bit of English.The Food: We both got the #2 on the menu, which is the special seafood noodle soup (shrimp, egg, chicken, beef, and bokchoy) for $12. We also ordered the Shrimp Flavor Soup Dumplings for $8 to share between us.  The noodle soup was delicious, and they had condiments like chili oil and Sriracha sauce. The chili oil seeds made the noodle soup ten times better, so I will come back here for some more!Overall: Great for a budget meal, and everything is very fresh!",0
"I visited this place last night and I was disappointed with basically everything. I'm giving one star because the staff is friendly but that's about it, otherwise I would have given 0 stars if possible.First, the tables are very tight, they sit 8 to 10 people at a small hibachi table and you can't barely move. The room was very small with 2 tables. I had to get up and move my chair so that the chef could get to the table. Very uncomfortable. No decor, it looked like we were in a classroom.Mediocre overpriced food. I had chicken teriyaki ($26) which was tasteless, no salt. My wife had salmon ($29) and despite ordering it well done it was medium rare inside. Yes, we're talking about a medium rare fish, not a steak! As appetizers we were given 3 small shrimps each. I paid 6.70 for a Budlight. Other beers were even more expensive. Yes, more expensive than clubs. And my wife's cocktail was $14 in a small glass. The hibachi chef was an Indian guy, polite but not fun at all. He tried to make jokes but he just wasn't suited for the job since he was not fun and he could not cook a salmon or a chicken teriyaki .At the end our bill was $86 + tips so we ended up paying more than $100 bucks for a mediocre dinner. Never again! I would not recommend this place.",0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at TikTok's latest restaurant. The line was long, so I decided to go in. The restaurant was very casual and comfortable, with seating both in the main area and in a separate bar area. The design was cool and modern, and it was great for groups of two or four.

The menu was very limited, consisting only of wines and cocktails. There were no menu names or descriptions of what was available. We were given a placemat with all of the information, which was a bit confusing.

The food was okay, but not great. The skirt steak was tough to chew, and the salad and fries were good. The martini I ordered was very strong, however, so kudos to the bartender.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, but it's worth checking out if you're in the area.",1
"Surprised by the good reviews. Ordered a Caesar salad and pizza and it was just okay. The pizza crust was not what I was expecting, not your typical thin crust New York pie. The sausage tasted strange so I ended up taking it off.",0
"Surprisingly delicious fries! Im enjoying this whole outdoor dining, sitting on sidewalks and observing a new quiet manhattan. Staff were really sweet, it was late at night towards closing and they still took us for a drink and food (we had to order something with drinks - law!) I wonder what they're like during brunch, i wouldn't put it past them that its great!",0
We had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The shrimp roll was delicious and the hot sauce added a nice kick. The tea eggs were also a great addition. The soymilk was a nice touch and made the meal even more refreshing. We would definitely recommend this spot to others.,1
"**** Brunch review****- steak was tough and chewy- fries were cold- waffle was alright  * I did like the whipped cream and blueberries- Chicken tasted like it was from a bag- Chicken was overly salty- During the brunch party, the speakers continued to bleed relentlessly- The Saturday DJ was good after u ignored the ear torture- The unlimited margarita tasted like cheap liquor- Service was impeccable",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The grill is great because it's open during the day, and the service is usually good. The only downside is that the tables are very close together, and it can be a little uncomfortable if someone behind you needs more space. The food is always great, and I especially love the Malbec wine. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I can't wait to come back to this restaurant with my sister - the food was absolutely fantastic! I especially loved the pasta dishes - they were all so delicious. The only downside was that the bread served at the table was a bit too GF for my taste, but everything else was really great. The atmosphere is really authentic and I love how it feels like we're in Italy!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The noodles were really chewy and delicious, and all of the products tasted great. I only took off one star because they did a little trick on the check - they added a 15% tip already, but if you didn't know they did this, they would also staple the tip so that it would appear to be a regular tip. I don't really like this kind of thing, it feels like lying to your customers. All in all, though, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I just finished my pork katsu donburi. It was so good and nicely presented. I liked how they put 3 different sides. And the price was also affordable ($13.06) and I didn't need to wait too long to get the food. I had a bad experience once in here when I dined in before pandemic, but it seems like the service got nicer as well!",0
"The Smith is a great spot for brunch, with a large menu and expansive hours. The coffee service was lovely, and the bar staff was helpful without being overbearing. My dish was a bit a-okay, but the potatoes were some of the best I've had - fried up to perfection and loaded with flavor. I would definitely recommend this spot to solo diners and large groups alike.",1
"I'm actually quite disappointed in RH. They spent an elaborate amount of money to set up the beautiful rooftop restaurant and all that's appealing is the space. I shared the LOBSTER ROLL, KALE CAESAR, and a beer with my boyfriend and that was $75 for lunch. The food was mediocre, service was good, but you're only there for the ambiance which isn't really worth it. ENJOY!",0
"So cheap and delicious. 7.50 for the 3 meat large which is large enough for me to share with my boyfriend. My favorite is the pork and he likes the duck, but we usually get the 3 meat for the variety. At 6pm dinner time the line is usually 10-15 people deep but they move pretty quick.",0
"In my opinion, L'Artusi serves New York City's best pasta. I've visited the restaurant twice now and through these visits I've been able to try four of their seven pasta offerings: the Garganelli, bucatini, spaghetti, and cacio pépé and ohhhh my goodness--they are ALL worthy of five stars. My favorites by a hair are the garlicky spaghetti and the bucatini with pancetta. If you're able to share dishes with your companion(s), I'd recommend doing so, because you really cannot go wrong at L'Artusi. I've also found that the service is really incredible. The servers know the food and wine incredibly well and are both patient yet attentive. The wait staff wipe down your table between courses and change your silverware each time as well. The restaurant has a broad variety of wine options (all from Italy though) and bottles start around ~$60 and go up to... much more. That said, there's certainly something for everyone. The espresso martini I had here was also perhaps my favorite in NYC as well. And the olive oil cake... *chef's kiss*. I did not think I'd be done of the raisins but I was so so wrong. They're absolutely delicious. Given the quality and quantity of food (amongst other things, like the impeccable ambiance and service), L'Artusi is very well priced as well. Each pasta was ~$25. Desserts were ~$10-15. I'll certainly be back as often as I'm able to (i.e., if the Resy gods permit).",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant with my sister in love and my niece in love. The bartender, Carlito, was amazing and kept our glasses full and tasty cocktails. We dined on an array of appetizers - lemon pepper cauliflower wings - Lemon pepper wings and hot wings- Papaya salad - Shrimp rolls. Our drinks started off with us all having different drinks before we ended up having the same drinks plus plenty of shots from the bartender.

This place is cute and quaint and perfect for drinks from our experience, but it appeared that several people had dinner at tables and the place picked up pretty good after we hung for a hour or two at the bar. I look forward to returning for more CHEERS moments.",1
"In a city that skews almost 15% Italian-American, why is it so hard to find decent Italian in East Harlem? Ordering takeout here made me regret my decision not to just cook tonight. $10 for three of the tiniest veal meatballs I've ever had -- seriously, smaller than ping pong balls! Cesar salad with sad, wilted romaine that tasted like it was from a bodega and the soggiest rigatoni's ever. After being disappointed more than once by Nocciola, I was hoping this place would be better. Oh well, guess we'll have to keep our Italian cravings below 96th St.",0
"I went to this restaurant because the service was great, but I was very disappointed with the food. The home fries were terrible--they were shredded carrots and tasted like they were covered in a sealant (like shredded cheese). I also didn't like the prices--I could have gotten a lot more food for a lot less money at other restaurants. I would not recommend this place.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The cocktails and wine were perfect to start off with, and the food was even better. The Charred Halloumi was my favorite dish, it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. The cauliflower was also really good, and I loved the apple chutney and pistachios that were added to it. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also really nice, with rustic decor and a marble bar. It felt like there were a lot of regulars here, which is a good sign that people keep on coming back! Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"Came with a few friends on a Sunday morning. Wait was about 30  minutes but it was warm and beautiful outside. We ordered several items which came fairly quickly. Tables were small and seating was a bit tight, but service was fast. 1. Pulut Panggang: this was one of my favorites b/c I loved the dried shrimp flavor. My friends didn't like it so much b/c it was too fishy for them. 2. Kaya Butter Toast: after reading all the reviews, we decided to try this and I was very pleasantly surprised!! The flavor of the kaya jam was so unique, perfectly balanced against the warm melted butter. Would definitely recommend folks trying this.3. Pulut Inti: nothing too special, wouldn't recommend necessarily4. Penang style hand rolled muah chee: wow, so great. The mochi was super fresh and soft. It comes out warm which makes it so much better! So much softer and flavorful because of the warmth. Also loved the ground peanuts and sesame and with each bite, I would try to dip the rest of my mochi and exposed sticky rice into the ground nut mixture to scoop more of it up.All in all, I had been eyeing this place for the past few years and I'm glad I finally got to try it. A bit pricey as the portion sizes are small, and if you have a big appetite, I'm not sure you'd get full without spending a ton. A great place if you want some tasty snacks though!",0
"Max Brenner's is a beautiful restaurant with an amazing atmosphere. The service is top-notch and the drinks are amazing. We ordered an appetizer and it was really subpar. However, the other food items looked really good and the Italian drinking chocolate was incredible. I felt like it gave my soul a hug and I will never stop talking about how great it was.",1
"Mr. Takahachi and Ryo, I hope that you will reopen and still be there when we go back to work.  I will go see you for delicious sushi once again.  Thanks!",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was fantastic, and the service was great. I especially loved the asparagus dish and the bread pudding. I only had a few minor complaints, such as the duck confit empanadas not being my favorite, and the kimchi paella not being very strong in the kimchi flavor. However, overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"Love this place! I always come here when I want something hot and soupy. They have a lot of options on the menu, but disappointed that they dont have kimchi fried rice on the menu?? If im not mistaken. Would come here more often if they had that option. Other than that, this place is great! Worth the price!",0
"I really enjoy Paris Baguette for their pastry and cakes. The service can be inconsistent, but overall it's a great place to get a light breakfast. I miss the Union Square branch, but the new one by 23rd street is great.",1
"I ordered the fugazza, the chicken, the spinach with cheese and the corn in bechamel.  It was all great!! I also ordered through grubhub.  So great and convenient.Fugazza here is onion and cheese.  In argentina, a fugazza is like a foccaccia and often without tomato sauce. Empanadas were baked.  This is how it should be.",0
"The primary reason for coming here is because I'm a huge Eddie Huang fan. Everything about his hustle and vibe is something I can relate too, so on my visit to NYC, I knew I had to give the original location a shot. My first experience of BaoHaus was at the LA location, and sad to say, it left a lot to be desired. Being that NYC is the original location, I decided to give it another shot, and it changed my mind on the food at baohaus. On this trip, I went with the chairman and the spiceland bao. The chairman's pork belly was so good! Tender, fatty, and melt in your mouth goodness, definitely worth a try. My friend order the regular chicken and it was clear that for me, the spicy version is the way to go. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but the sauce adds a creamy texture to the bite, which elevates it versus the non-spicy. The pickled cabbage and crushed peanuts add a nice crunch factor, which equates to a well-rounded bite.Seating is limited. There's a bar-style seating, along with couple small tables for groups of 5-6, but when it's busy, it might be best to take it to-go or eat outside. Overall, great place to grab a bite and catch a vibe. Old school hip hop blaring on the speakers, delicious bites, all a win-win. Open til 3:30am on Friday and Saturday, a great place to get to after a night out on the town.",0
"I went to this AYCE sushi restaurant and wasn't impressed. I got 30 pieces total with 6 different toppings, and some of them were awful (salmon, yellowtail, salmon roe), while others were just okay (eel, shrimp, smelt roe). It honestly tasted like they bought everything frozen and pre-sliced because all the fibers were broken down, and the texture of everything was just like cold fatty jelly. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I had a pretty disappointing experience at this restaurant. The drinks are reasonably priced during happy hour, but the food was pretty bland. The flatbread was bland and the fish and chips were not crispy at all. The atmosphere is very nice, but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. The staff was friendly, but I wouldn't return.",1
"Living up to having no. 1 in your name is a pretty tall task but I think Los Tacos does a pretty fine job. I've had this bookmarked for a while but haven't had the chance to check it out until now. As expected, there was a line to get in. They have a sign indicating estimated time but I found that it was much quicker, which was great because I was HUNGRY. I ordered the Carne Asada, Pollo Asado and Adobada tacos to try. Ordering was seamless and then you're directed to the assembly section where you're asked a couple of questions as to how you want your order - corn or flour tortilla and toppings, in my case. If you want to dine in, there's counter space and a few seats by the window for you to choose from. I absolutely love the Adobada taco - it was so well marinated and tasty! The Pollo Asado was a close second. Honestly, you can't really go wrong. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Look forward to coming back when I'm in the area.",0
"The noodles at this restaurant were really good, but the broth was really fatty and sour. I didn't enjoy the tsukemen at all - it was more like a soup than a dipping sauce. The takoyaki was also okay.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at SE Asia. The decor is very reminiscent of SE Asia, but the food didn't quite live up to the standards set by the restaurants in that region. The pad thai was overly sweet for my taste, and the chicken in the hainese chicken dish was sparse and mostly bones. The rice itself was also not particularly flavorful, and the prices are a bit high for the area. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, and I would recommend looking elsewhere for a good meal.",1
"Kenn's Broome Street Bar is a must-visit for anyone interested in the history of Soho. The establishment has been around for over 40 years and has played an important role in the transformation of the area from a gritty manufacturing district to the trendy artsy neighborhood of today. The bar is still serving up the best drinks and burgers around, and the atmosphere is casual and inviting.",1
"Very busy here at 1:30pm on a Friday afternoon. Another hankering for their Vegetable Tagine.  This time it wasn't too salty and there were plenty of fresh garnishes so there is crunch with every bite. It usually comes with potatoes, but I think it would be too filling so I always opt out of those.  Perfect for when you feel under the weather. Warms you up and is tasty as well as healthy.",0
"COVID-19 update:In case you needed some good news: Kiki's is open during the pandemic, in a takeout and delivery capacity. They're offering the full menu and great prices on their wine selection. The food still absolutely holds up. The dishes are delicious as ever so please go support Manhattan's favorite Greek. OH, and pro-tip: A bottle of house wine (1.5L) is $20. You're welcome.",0
"I had a really negative experience at this restaurant on Friday night. The bouncer had the biggest power trip for a bar that isn't exclusive or anything special at all. Normally I don't feel the need to leave reviews like this, but I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.",1
The market and uber here at little Spain are very aesthetically pleasing. They had the doors open so that we could be sitting inside without freezing. We tried the croquettes and got the macaroni with chorizo. They both were okay but not anything better than we could do ourselves. Slightly disappointing but glad we tried it.,0
"This is a great spot for happy hour. They have sangria and martinis for $8 each, and the lychee martini is especially delicious. It's a great place to relax after a long day. The outdoor seating is also really nice.",1
"Gave this place another try, because the food was so good.  We retuned on a weeknight and had a totally different experience.  The tight table that we were seated at on a Saturday night wasn't there- I guess that it's added in to accommodate diners.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to maximize profits, but that table was a squeeze.  Our friends who made the reservation are regulars, which made the seating more surprising. Anyway, we were seated at a comfortable table.  Our waiter was lovely.  The grilled bread was excellent.  There was no corkage fee the night that we went, so we brought a couple of kick ass bottles of wine.  We had our waiter try them and sent a glass to a solo diner at the next table.  It felt like we were having dinner at a friend's house.  The food was up to the very good to excellent standard that was set on our last visit.  Don't miss the stuffed artichoke.  There was a veal chop parm special that the chef was nice enough to make as a veal chop Milanese.  Amazing!  Too full for dessert, once again. A really good restaurant, but your experience may vary depending on where you are seated.",0
I've been going to Thai Son for decades and they never disappoint. They have nice outdoor seating and service is quick and efficient as always. The pho is super flavorful and the summer rolls are always refreshing. Please continue to support this restaurant!,0
"Overall, I thought the food at Rosa Mexicano was good, but it's a bit pricey for what you get. The chicken quesadilla was my favorite dish, but it was a bit dry and lacked cheese or chicken. The waiter was friendly, but he didn't come back to check on us or ask if we needed anything.",1
"Wah Fung is a great place to go for a quick and cheap meal on the Lower East Side. The meats are delicious and the prices are unbeatable. The only downside is that the line can be long, so be prepared to wait.",1
"First, let's talk about the decor cuz I'm a design nut. The distressed, rustic look is so effing gorgeous here, I couldn't stop feasting my eyes. Beautiful like Blake Lively in front of a Mykonos sunset.Next, food and drink. I was hungover like a sorority girl during Pledge Week, but I still couldn't resist the Love Me Amaro, with St. Germain, grapefruit, lemon, and Prosecco. It was the perfect shot of hair of the dog. My friend and I got the Farmer's Bowl and Belgian Waffles, and both were scrumptiously perfect vegan brunch dishes. If you're on a health kick, definitely get the Farmer's Bowl--there are more nutrients in it than a GNC shop.",0
"so happy to discover Wayan! on the recommendation from a friend, we booked a table for saturday at 9 for 2. although new, i think this place is already popular because it was difficult to find a table on resy. we were seated right away at a lovely half booth in the back. the restaurant is so beautiful. it's dimly lit and romantic, and the indonesian decor transports you far far away from new york.our waiter informed us that plates are meant to be shared so we ended up ordering a lot.highlights for us were the chicken satay (so amazing i could have easily ordered another plate of them) the baby back pork ribs, eggplant balado, and the pandan custard. i would skip the clams jimbaran as they had no taste of coconut whatsoever, and whatever topping was in its place was kind of mushy and lukewarm. drinks here were excellent as well, especially the coconut saturated kelapa. service was excellent and friendly. all in all we had a wonderful experience and we look forward to returning!",0
"All 7 of the dishes we ordered were delicious and satisfying! We got almost all of the veggie dishes , the goat, prawn, and the beetroot. Food was well flavored and hard to pick a favourite one! Service was also very friendly and fast",0
"This place just popped up on my Yelp recommendations. So of course I dropped everything and made it here after work today. I'm always down for dim sum and willing to try any new dim sum spot especially if I don't have to go all the way to Flushing.The restaurant is located on a less busy street tucked under some scaffolding and doesn't have a huge sign so it could be easily missed. When we arrived, there was maybe only 1 other person dining. So this place must be pretty new. It was very clean, and the ambiance was very casual. They had a lot of the standard dim sum items, which were all $5.75 each (soft opening promos!) Assuming the prices will go up eventually, but this was a pretty solid deal. I enjoyed all the items we got especially the chicken feet, xiao long bao and the pork spare ribs. The staff was courteous and attentive. This is a really great addition to the neighborhood!",0
I ordered for delivery from this place and I didn't expect them to mess up a simple order. How do you mix up crawfish and jumbo shrimp? Jumbo shrimp is very big in comparison to crawfish. I'm actually grossed out by crawfish. Might be better to eat there in person at the restaurant. Overall taste of the food is good but is very pricey for the amount of food you're getting when I compare to another place. Might as well make this yourself at home,0
"We were so excited to try this restaurant based on the great reviews it received, but our experience was a complete disappointment. The Pad Thai tasted as if a student had tried to make it in his/her home kitchen and only had tomato sauce on hand. It was more like spaghetti and sauce than Pad Thai. The other wide noodle dish with shrimp was just OK. The calamari was fine.

However, the staff seemed to be much more interested in gossiping and laughing with each other than serving patrons. Our $50 dinner- such a waste!",1
"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! Was heading to my fav Italian spot up the street from here and for the second time in 2 weeks, my old spot was still closed (apparently they open when they feel like it).  So the hubs and I continued wandering and came across Amici. We were pleasantly welcomed and quickly seated in their air cooled restaurant. I'm a fan of chicken française but it wasn't on their lunch menu. Well, the host told me not to worry, he'd make it happen! Oh my!!! It was freaking awesome! Every bite had that lemony flavor I like. Seriously, my meal was incredible. It was served with pasta in the same sauce. The pasta was perfectly al dente too! We had an appetizer of calamari. It tasted great but in my opinion, for $17 I'd have expected twice the portion served. We were served some bread and a great garlic dipping oil too. The service was great. All the guys who came by our table were super friendly and accommodating. Will this become my new fav in Little Italy?? I think so! Will definitely be back in the near future as my entire experience was top notch, calamari and all!",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at Miss Lou's Chinese Restaurant. The Hunanese dish Miss Lou's Famous Beef Stew was really delicious and had a great flavor. The portions were also really generous and I was able to enjoy the dish even though it was a bit hot. The Mountain Baked Fish was also good but I did not love it as much. The fish was tender and the sauce was flavorful, but I felt that there wasn't a lot of fish in the dish. The Stir Fried Eggplant & String Beans was also a great dish, it was very garlicky and had a great flavor. The service was fast and friendly and I would definitely recommend Miss Lou's Chinese Restaurant to others. It's a bit on the pricey side, but the food is definitely worth it.",1
"I'm about a week out from having actually dined at Mimmo  Cucina Italiana. I had to double back and write this review. Mimmo is a nice sizes restaurant with a full bar on one side and a chic dining area on the other. The place is bright with lots of art on the walls. When you walk in, don't be confused because the seating area is up past the bar. Mimmo also has a visible brick oven  just beyond the dinning area. I will say, when we arrived, the restaurant had that fresh brick oven smell but it quick dissipated by the time we were served our first round of bellinis. I say that to say, if you get here when they first open as we did, be prepared for that. My friend and I enjoyed the bottomless brunch but we also had the opportunity to order other menu items as well. I had an Italian style omelette with the most amazing sausage and my friend had the steak sandwich. Everything was served hot and delicious. The service we received was stupendous. I'm not always in the neighborhood but when return, Mimmo  Cucina Italiana will definitely be on my to-do list.",0
"Definitely a good spot I'd love to return to! I came toward the end of the lunch hour so kind of had to rush into ordering FYI (got there around 2:10). I had the chicken dosa which were tasty but FYI very spicy! They use ghost pepper sauce in it and I liked it but it was maybe sliiiightly too spicy for me to finish everything. Good flavor though. My friend had the paneer dosa which were tasty and also used the ghost pepper but didn't seem as spicy. LOVED the naan. I know that naan seems like a pretty basic item but I really can tell the difference between a good one and just an average one. The naan here is absolutely delicious, not dry, and full of flavor. I also got the lime soda but wasn't nuts about the flavor. I had the option of getting it sweet or salty or a combination of both and I went with the combination. If I were to order it again, I would go just sweet.The decor is super pretty and the cocktails on the menu look good. Most Indian restaurants seem to be pretty whatever when it comes to ambiance/trendiness so this one definitely outranks other Indian restaurants for being fun and modern. The service was also great. I would definitely like to return for dinner and to try other items on the menu.",0
"I tried out this Korean tapas restaurant and while the food is definitely not authentic, some dishes were pretty good. My favorite was the wings, egg volcano, and nachos. The prices for the ""small"" plates aren't justified by either flavor or quality of ingredients, but they do have a good drink selection. I didn't enjoy the food as much as I did the drinks, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",1
"I ordered from them online and they waited an ENTIRE HOUR and then canceled my order, I also called after I placed the order maybe like 6 times and NO ONE answered. Incredibly unprofessional - save yourself some time and go somewhere else.",0
Decided to try a new place for Chinese food for lunch special. This place is 4 blocks further than wok 88 from me so I figured I'd see how good their competitors are.The interior is very nice and the lady running the desk was very nice. However the Asian food was just average and imho not worth going back to try anything else. I did not try the sushi.I got a ta-chin chicken and pepper steak. Both dishes were heavy on the veggies and just lacked any significant flavor. I did get an egg roll and it was prob the best part of the meal. The fried rice was better than most places too.,0
"Been wanting to visit for YEARS and YEARS. It was time to finally check this place out and I'm happy I did. Looked over the menu prior to take out so I'm not standing there overly flustered. Ordered the lamb combo plate with falafel, hummus and baba ganouj along with fries, tabbouleh and baklava. I stan everything but the tabbouleh and the baklava. They just weren't my jam. This was more than enough for 2 people and I share with my parents as well. I would definitely come back to get the combo plate again and try the other desserts. Would come and grab a sandwich one of these days too but I feel like that has to be eaten fresh vs bring it home. Service was great. I was greeted and the cashier double checked my order prior to payment. The place is small so no dine in because of pandemic but things might have changed since this review. Overall, come here for the flavor bomb. I can see why its a staple in East Village. The prices are decent too!",0
"I heard a lot of good things about this place so my friend and I decided to try it out. The food was pretty good, but some things were a little pricey for my liking. The guac was $15 and we were like :/. Anyways for the main course we got the birria tacos and quesadillas, which were pretty good, the meat was pretty flavorful and juicy. However what put me off a little bit was the loud music on both floors. My friend and I had to yell to talk to each other and it was a fun vibe but not if you want to talk. I wish they had music on only one floor. I don't think I would come back here.",0
"South of the Clouds near NYU is a noodle spot that should serve its purpose of filling you up with food. I do take issue with the fact that the prices on the menu displayed outside are not the same, and no effort was made to indicate they might have been changed. The waitress however did let us know the prices are different as we entered the premises. The menu seems to have been more extensive in the past, so you might be a bit disappointed if you wish to order more than just noodles. We did like the Mala Beef, which had a sufficient amount of beef. The pieces of bok choy are yummy too. The beef noodle soup has fewer pieces of beef, but is nonetheless filling. The spice level is adequate but nothing crazy.You do pay through your phone via a link, and have the choice of paying before or after your meal.",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The Thai food wasn't my favorite, but their fried chicken caught my attention. I ordered their chicken rice dish and it was really good. The ginger rice was very hot, steaming through the box. It was fresh, well-flavored, and the whole dish came out very nicely. It wasn't amazing, but I bumped my rating to 5 stars because of the amazing side soup. In addition to the spices, there was a small piece of winter melon in it, which made it even more delicious. I would definitely come back here, and I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Such a lucky find! I had some time to kill before meeting a friend and searched for bars in the area and St. Tropez was a short walk away. The dimly lit interior, hanging lights, wooden, intimate setting made me wish we were coming here instead, but we already had a reservation nearby. I ordered a Beaujolais and longingly gazed at the tartelette aux courgettes the couple next to me was enjoying. After much debate, since I was heading to dinner, I decided to just get it and I'm so glad I did. It's perfectly flaky and flavored and the roasted plum? tomatoes are perfect with it. I should also mention how smooth and balanced the Beaujolais was. Perfectly medium Beaujolais and tartelette later, I just wanted to stay and order all of the vegetarian dishes on the menu--everything looked so good."" Bienvenue en Provence "" signs hung about, but nothing more lends an authentic feel than walking into a French resto/bar and having a French or francophone bartender/server. It really adds a special charm and authentic feel and he was gracious enough to let me get a bit of practice in and order in French.A special mention would be to the wonderful hostess Kathryn (sp). We got to talking and she's so sweet and has such a welcoming spirit. Although I'm not in West Village often, I'll make a point to stop in because it's just so great. À bientôt, St. Tropez.",0
"The restaurant was empty on a Saturday evening, where all other adjacent businesses were bustling. I should have taken the atmosphere at face value and gone elsewhere immediately. Sure enough we got in a miscommunication with the server and eventually left before ordering. She was rude to begin with and adamant on seating the three of us on a tiny table meant for 2. Understandable had the place been busy. But there were numerous 4-tops open and even the counter to choose from. We asked politely to make the switch, and were told no. We walked a couple of minutes down the road and found a nearby Ramen shop called Menkoi Sato with friendlier servers, so it all worked out in the end.",1
"Went last week for a quick bite after a work social and put our name on the wait list and 2 out of 3 of us were there but they would not seat us until the full party which is fine if the restaurant was busy but why they could not seat us when the restaurant had a few open tables? I would have given them 4 stars but because of them not willing to adjust their policy, I downgraded it by a star. We ordered the Japjae, soft shell crab and a sushi roll. I didn't try the sushi, but the noodles and crab were pretty good.",0
"Lovely place with a cozy vibe. Everything was flavorful yet light . Loved the starters - crab guacamole was a nice surprise. A few friends and I shared truffle fries and two mussel pots, classic with white wine (can't go wrong!) and the spicy red wine sauce that had a nice kick! The sauces were heaven for dipping bread. My kind of comfort food. Ended the night with some donuts to share. All wonderful. Great service as well.",0
As someone with shanghainese roots I'm always extra critical of shanghainese restaurants. I will say this place was pretty good and fairly priced. I went with a group of 6 others and we got 6 dishes and 3 appetizers and were sufficiently full. We got Xiao long baos and Pan friends pork buns. The Xiao long baos had tons of soup but the skin was a little thicker than I would've wanted. Pan fried buns were ok -- could have been more crispy. From the dishes we got the best was the salted duck yolk fish filet which I unfortunately don't have a picture of but if I ever come here again I definitely am ordering that! The spicy chicken was also really good but would have loved some more chicken in that dish. Overall the food was good and service was great. Also if you check in on Yelp you get a free dessert which is anything on their dessert menu!!,0
It's trendy and my experience was fine. Kind of expensive and nothing special though.,0
I think I gasped when I opened the massive bag revealing this monstrosity of a serving. Like someone just insulted me and my ancestors to my face. It felt like some Italian man took off his glove and slapped me with it. It felt like I showed up to the local downtown shelter and was given some federally funded ration of frozen bread and hacked avocado. For $25. This is your avocado toast. For twenty five dollars. Giving it more than one star because I have been through a lot of therapy to forgive those that hurt me. I'll pray for you senza gluten.,0
"Hay Hay Roasted is a great place to get a roast duck. The duck was crispy and delicious, and the wait on a Saturday around noontime wasn't bad - 10-15 min from when I got in line to when I walked out with the meat. I actually brought most of the meat back and froze it, and flew with it because I was visiting my parents, who can't get roast duck where they live. We reheated it in the oven and it was good as new (except some more of the fat had been dripped off) - still tasty and crispy. Note that the duck and drippings sauce are on the saltier side, so you'll want it with rice.",1
"Try: Handmade spinach and artichoke rotolo pasta with homemade ricotta.Why: Support local small businesses as part of NYC Restaurant Week for $20.21. The Rotolo was a delicious Italian dish that was creamy and full of flavor. This was a unique dish I've never had before and looked like rolled-up pasta. It came with three large pieces with a base layer of bechamel, a creamy white sauce. It was neat digging into the Rotolo and dip each bite into the sauce. The meal also came with cannellini beans with broccoli rabe and roasted red peppers, which was good. I would have liked more broccoli rabe. Overall, a great meal!",0
"I had a great time at this cute ramen place in Union Square! The Japanese character paintings on the walls were really cute and the ramen tasted really good. My friends and I each ordered a different ramen: Shio, Tantanmen, Tonkatsu, and Spicy Miso. They all looked promising and the flavors were rich, but the Tonkatsu had a hint of spicy to it that I wasn't expecting. The pork belly was a bit overcooked and towards the salty side. The noodle was just right and the soft boiled egg were perfect although for an additional $2. The fried gyoza was also different and I enjoyed it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Thank you for keeping things going during all this craziness. The staff is friendly and makes sure that even while dining outside, you have a great experience. Kudos to you all! Came in for brunch with a reservation (which I recommend) and got a nice dry spot under the awning and near a heater. Brunch is always delicious. The Nueske's bacon with pepper jelly and peanut butter is a must. And I opted for the Mezze & Eggs which was light and perfect. Two eggs with a smattering of tasty sides: beet tabbouleh, butternut squash puree, and farro. Yummy! My friend's short rib hash was the perfect warming dish for the outdoors. I would highly recommend to keep ya warm and cozy. I'll definitely be back as much as I can to support our neighborhood eats.",0
"The Ragtrader Bo Peep is a fantastic spot to have a meal and enjoy a well crafted cocktail near Madison Square Garden. Lots of great bites to pick from but make sure the wings with Fresno chili sauce, sriracha deviled eggs and fries & dips are on your list. And save room for the cheeseburger which has nice patty flavor only enhanced by its special sauce.",1
"My husband & I dined at Porter House for a previous Restaurant Week lunch (in all honesty, because I'd heard this place was overpriced during other times). I had a Caesar salad (delish), Petit Filet Mignon & the Cheesecake. My husband had the Cowboy rib steak off the regular menu. My filet was cooked perfect med-rare, & I was so full I couldn't even finish my cheesecake. My husband said his ribeye was cooked well, very simple salt & pepper, but he would have preferred a steak that was more ""dry-aged"" (originally wanted the Chili-rubbed that is aged, but was told it might be too spicy). So why less stars for service? Hubs was VERY offended because the waitress-- while talking to the diners sitting NEXT TO US-- referred to us as ""Kids"". REPEATEDLY. Also, she never once offered a wine list! Maybe I'll return for the food, but hopefully they'll hold the side order of judgement.",0
"I had a great time at Pilot! The boat itself is really cute and there are some great phot angles on the top and back of boat. The service was great and our waitress was really attentive. I especially appreciated that she could change our party number last minute. We ordered some mocktails and I got the Tropicana cocktail which was good but not very strong. The gin and champagne cocktail, forget the name, tasted exactly like a mimosa and I wasn't too impressed with it. The luster platter which was a sampler of all their different oysters for $70 was really good though. Fiscally, it's the best bang for your buck and they were SO GOOD! Comes with a trio of sauces too and we were all pleased. The fries were also good, not greasy and without the added grease and shame. The aoli for dipping was good but the ketchup kinda weird it has some additives. Overall, I had a great time at Pilot and I would definitely come back.",1
"I visited the XO location in Chinatown in Manhattan and it was a great experience. The people are as expected and the service won't be top-notch, but the food is definitely worth mentioning. There was a wait for about 30-40 minutes when we got there for a table of 7 people on a Saturday, but it was worth it since the food was so good. There is a great variety of dishes on the menu, and I especially loved the XO style turnip cake and the Japanese fried dumplings. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some comfort food.",1
"Extremely underwhelming Resturant with a wait staff that is nonexistent just as the other reviews stated. The hostess were nice nothing against them. We were there for a birthday and let the hostess know. I don't think it was communicated at all as they did absolutely nothing. Food comes out relatively fast but if you need anything or have an issue, you will not find a waiter around. A quick disclaimer, there were some who brought food to the table who had a great vibe and were nice. Overall the food was meh. Definitely not worth the price. The quantities are small finger food sizes and the taste is overwhelmed with extensive heat and spice. The chicken skewers had one small pineapple chunk on each skewer. The experience wasn't the greatest and music was so loud you can't have a conversation at all. Won't be returning here. 2 stars for the ambience though.",0
"I had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The noodles are amazing, with a variety of tasty broths, soups and then they are the dumplings! So flavorful. Steamed or fried. I prefer steamed. My favorite is absolutely the spicy pork stew! Big portions, fair prices and super fast delivery!!",1
"Overall, I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The food was good and reasonably priced. My favorites were the banana walnut pancakes and chicken n waffles. The staff was friendly, but I did need to flag them down since they were so busy. The bathroom was single-stall coed, but it did have long lines.",1
"Popped in here for dinner with some friends on a Saturday night while waiting to get in at Attaboy and had a great meal (we were also able to sit at the bar right away). I had the Ume combo (yellow tail, salmon, crunchy tuna) as well as a crab meat and eel hand roll - eel was my favorite. Great bathroom, too - shout-out to that heated toilet seat.Kazunori is still my fave but this is up there. Way chiller vibe, too. 4.5 stars.",0
"It was pretty good but not the best with so many fantastic Mexican options in the city.  We got the Mexican Street Corn and a bunch of tacos (Crispy Fish, Pulled Pork, Pan Seared Cod, Burnt Ends Brisket, Avacado, Lobster).   I don't know if the street corn wasn't in season but it tasted a bit undercooked/less sweeter than expected.  My mom really enjoyed the lobster taco.  I loved the burnt ends brisket taco.  We also had the mojito and the mule which were pretty good.  Again, it's a solid choice but with so many phenomenal Mexican options in the city, it's tough.",0
"We stopped by this pub for a quick bite on our way to Times Square. The location is great, and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing. We ordered apps and drinks, and I was really happy with my choice of nachos with no meat. My husband got the chicken tikka masala, and he said it was excellent. The only downside was that the meal was a bit pricey, but the location definitely made up for it. Our server was attentive but not pushy, and my water glass stayed full all night long. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience here and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Mildly disappointed in this popular bottomless brunch spot. The service was extremely slow -- we didn't get our drinks until 20+ mins after ordering, and was even more delayed on the food. Giving it 3 stars for the incredible guacamole & chips, but even the brunch entrees were just average.We ordered the Spiced Calabaza + Bacon Guacamole - definitely recommend! Really fresh and good. For entree, ordered the Quesadilla Eggs Benny...definitely disappointing. Not much to it in either flavor or quantity. Drinks - we loved the frozen margs. Blood Mary was spicier than preferred. Food: 2/5Service/Speed: 2/5Price (college student budget): $ (good deal for bottomless)Ambiance: Casual, open space. Great atmosphere for big groups.Would return & recommend? 3/5",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for brunch and was not disappointed! The service was great, and they were able to accommodate us even when we switched tables multiple times due to the sweltering heat. I went with the bottomless mimosas and they were perfect - just the right amount of bubbly and delicious. I also really enjoyed the appetizer - the Brussels were so good! For my entree, I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was really good - spicy, but the pickled strawberries helped with that. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Post COVID- I was a little skeptical about this place. But it turned out fantastic! Dinner was delish! Sitting next to the water lake in Central Park, doesn't get more romantic than this. Well, this place is very nice for a family dinner or a nice low key date. Ladies room is right in the entrance on the left side. Three units available but one person at a time.",0
"Jongro was recommended by some friends, so I came here on a Friday night to enjoy some quality KBBQ. This is the place to be if you want quality meat. Upon entering, it felt like I was walking through Korea. The decorations were definitely on point, and it wasn't super smelly and smokey in the dining area.The food was all delicious. Every bite of meat was extremely tender and the sides were equally as good. I enjoyed the seafood pancakes a lot. They also cook the steamed egg in front of you, which I found unique compared to other kbbq I have had. In addition, this was probably the best service I've had for a kbbq. The waiters are extremely attentive and are on time with everything from grill changes to bringing dishes out. Overall, highly recommend if you don't need AYCE and you just want quality food!",0
"Stopped by on a weekday evening and had no wait!!I'd previously visited Mokyo, their sister restaurant and loved it so much that I had to also try Thursday Kitchen! My bf and I got 4 dishes to share and we were pretty full. We even got a complimentary shot after the meal! The truffle mac & cheese is one of the best mac & cheese I've ever had! There were notes of truffle, basil and everything was creamy and not too overpowering. The kimchi paella is something I've never experienced before and the shrimp (the best part!!) were SO flavorful. The only con here was that the shrimp wasn't peeled.The other two dishes (duck empanadas & edamame dumplings) we got were good, but didn't wow me. They also were a little more expensive imo - $14 for 3-4 pieces compared to the mac & cheese or paella. Service was wonderful and they were pretty busy for a weekday. Definielty would recommend going in a larger group so you can try more food!",0
Went there for a business lunch and I got the warm lobster Cobb salad. It tasted great with decent lobster tails and claws but one downside was the lettuce was quite too little for a salad as entree. The portion of veggie was almost just like a side. Other than that everything was great. Great outdoor sittings with good service.,0
Recently tried the watermelon dole whip and it was awesome - tasted like sour patch watermelon gummies. I didn't get poke on this trip but I'll definitely return for more soon!,0
"The food was good, but the portions were small. I would recommend the prix fixe instead of the tasting menu. The halibut was the worst dish in the whole menu.",1
"I went to this restaurant on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait. Apparently there's usually a line starting around 11am. It's eat-in only, no take-out which kind of sucks that they're turning away a huge base of customers. I had the cha siu rice roll which I thought was pretty good. The rice roll is thin and silky smooth. There's nice chunks of thinly sliced tender cha siu which is quite satisfying. I like how the rice roll is all drenched in soy sauce which was just the right amount of flavor, not too salty/sweet. The rice roll is definitely better quality than a lot of the chinatown places, but is it worth almost twice the price? I'm not so sure about that. This won't be my go-to place but I'll come back to indulge myself once in a while. I hope they do take-out soon!",1
"Came here yesterday for a quick bite to eat because my boyfriend and I wanted something light and we passed this place and decided to eat here. On the inside and outside it was very cute but immediately upon arriving, the staff was not very friendly and gave off the feeling that they did not want to talk to us past taking our order. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and I got the chicken burrito and for the price we paid it was NOT worth it. I wish I took pictures of how it came out, but I could have made better burritos/tacos at home. The tortillas tasted stale, food soggy and not good at all. Left very unsatisfied and with a stomach ache. Would not be coming back.",0
"TDLR: Big portions, sub-par food, awful service.I don't really understand the hype of this place, especially given the breadth and caliber of other ramen shops available in NYC. I'll start out by saying the only pro I experienced at TabeTomo was the portion size. Either the $18 Tsukemen or the Ramen is solely capable of satisfying a hungry adult. It all went downhill from there.I ordered a bowl of the Tsukemen and my girlfriend ordered a bowl of the ramen so we could try both. Both broths lacked the complexity of flavor that you would typically expect from a bowl of ramen - some combination of richness and umami. Here, the Tsukemen broth was nauseatingly heavy with a very heavy dash of soy that masked all of the other flavors potentially existent in the broth.The service here was no saving grace either. I ordered the 3 topping sampler with my noodles - consisting of extra pork chashu, scallions, and bamboo shoots. I received a total of 5 pieces of Chasu, the same as my gf who didn't order the extra toppings. When I asked the waitress about the toppings, she stated that the Tsukemen only comes with 1 slice of chashu (what - when was the last time you saw a $18 bowl of noodles with chashu included by default but only 1 slice?), and that the other 4 were my extras. Two friends who ordered the Tsukemen the day after each confirmed that they received 5 pieces, so basically the waitress scammed me of a $5 topping because what was I supposed to reply with? For some reason they put my chashu slices on the side on top of the noodles (which is good), but put all of the other veggies into the soup, which overloaded and soup and eventually made the veggies soggy.",0
"I was really disappointed with this pizza place - it's honestly just ""fine"". The sauce, cheese, and crust are all pretty basic, and I don't think their ingredients are particularly elite. The service is quick, but that's about it - it's not really worth checking out if you're in the area. I'd give it 3 stars max.",1
"Count Bistro Cassis is definitely not worth your time and money. The food was bland and unappetizing, and the prices are quite high for what you get. The staff was indifferent and unhelpful, and the decor was quite standard for a bistro in the UWS. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Still the BEST Indian food in the East Village/LES area!  Their delivery is quick, food is hot and fresh, great deals on lunch boxes.  I always call ahead of time for their chicken or lamb specials of the day for the lunch boxes - usually its chicken tikka masala or lamb curry.  It comes with the main (chicken, lamb or 2 vegetarian mains), a vegetable dish of the day, lentils, rice, naan, papadum (thin crispy cracker) with a sweet red sauce and a green mint sauce, and their rice pudding as dessert.  Please support your small restaurant businesses during these tough times!",0
The chicken noodle soup was amazing - with chunks of tender white meat and firm noodles. We'd pass on the organic white bean soup as it was more of a purée than a soup.,0
"The food is very standard brunch fare. You can't go wrong with any of the choices given that they all deliver on what you'd expect. The standout is the outdoor seating. Dogs allowed. Prime location in the Standard Hotel. Service is decent.

Overall, the restaurant is a decent choice for brunch. The food is good, the atmosphere is great, and the service is good. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey. But overall, it's a great spot for a weekend brunch.",1
"FIRST TIME IN NYC~!I'm not 100% sure how we found this place. But it was definitely a great find! We were just feeling like having some nice wine and some pupus to snack on. The Grub. INSALATA DI BARBABIETOLE ($16) This salad came with red beets, goat cheese, fava bean salad with balsamic dressing. This salad was so good, I'm a sucker for beets! GNOCCHI DI RICOTTA ($24) Home made ricotta gnocchi served in a creamy black truffle and chive sauce. Omg the gnocchi was so soft and fluffy. highly recommend ordering this! ANTIPASTO MISTO ($29) Cured meat platter served with San Daniele prosciutto, Speck Coppa, Mortadella and Sopressata, garnished  with cerignola olives,Parmigiano-Reggiano, artichokes  cipollini onions and sweet cherry peppers. This was the perfect dish to go with our red wine. Easy for us to share and just enjoy. A HUGE MAHALO to the Uva chef. The food was delicious and I would love to come back here again when I visit NYC again!",0
I came with a friend for Sunday brunch and they had many open tables. The food is not quite as good as some other places in the city. Nice atmosphere. Service was good but not remarkable.  I had vegetarian plate and it was not very good. Also some chairs were ripped off. Definitely not the place that I would come back. Food was not really fresh. There  are plenty of much better places around so I would prefer to go somewhere else. The only good thing was in that restaurant was guacamole.,0
"Tucked inside the Arlo hotel is Harold's with a swanky entrance. I had lunch here and ordered the Market Bowl which comes with a protein, grain, and 2 sides. I chose the salmon, quinoa, grilled broccolini, and spiced cauliflower. Everything was great except the cold and flavorless quinoa. You can argue that the portion is pretty small, the fish is a tiny cube and you only get one piece of cauliflower. I would still come back since it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I highly recommend the cheddar and chive biscuits, it is ridiculous how it melts in your mouth. The Mac and cheese was served bubbling from the pot and was amazing.",0
"I really enjoyed my visit to ABC Restaurant. The design and atmosphere are really cool and welcoming, and it's clear that they take pride in their food and service. The servers were very nice and the place ran like a well-oiled machine. The dishes were all good, but I found myself a bit hungry after eating three plates. The portions were quite small, however, and overall I had a enjoyable experience.",1
I visited this restaurant and was impressed. The delivery was fast and the food was great. The only thing I did not like was the dry chicken in the chauffa. The soy honey wings are to did for though.,1
"Samwon Garden Korean BBQ is just okay. The meats were good, but the flavors were not as strong as I would have liked. The gyoza were also frozen at the center, which was very surprising. Overall, I think there are better Korean BBQ restaurants in this area.",1
"I'd been excited to try Gyu-Kaku since 2018 LOL. Took my wife and I four years to actually try it due to unforeseen circumstances such as COVID-19 and other cravings. We finally popped in yesterday and got lucky with a table! The host seated us in a booth in the back corner facing 50th and 3rd - it was a good view. We had missed happy hour by about a minute, but our server was awesome enough to let us pay the hh pricing!

We went with the HH Meal for Two, I got a mug of Kirin and wife got a cocktail. The food experience was subpar. For starters, my Kirin tasted flat. My wife found a ladybug in her salad, which isn't the most disgusting thing, but still. However, one of the beef meats was fuego. I'm not sure exactly which meat it was, but in my picture it was the one on the top right. Everything else was just kinda there.

Although customer service was good, the overall food experience just wasn't there for us. 3/5 Yelp stars. Don't think we'll be back.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop in the Gotham Market Food Court. The bowl of ramen should be $7 tops, not $15.24. The broth isn't horrible, but it tastes like a soy sauce based instant ramen. The noodles also taste like it came from an instant packet, which isn't necessarily bad, but it is when it costs $15.24. The one piece of pork belly is tasty, but it's just one piece. The soft egg was nicely cooked, but the whole bowl was done after only 3 bites. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Winter Beer and I came here for a birthday dinner. We heard good things about the restaurant so, we decided to give it a go.  When we entered the restaurant, it was pretty much empty and we were able to sit where we wanted. There was no hostess on staff so, we did have to wait a few minutes for our presence to be acknowledged. Our waiter was fun and entertaining when he did stop by to take our orders. However, the service was very non-existent because you had to flag someone down. Even though the place was very empty, no one came to check in on you and you were left to your own devices. WB ordered an old fashioned margherita with pepperoni ($23) and loved it. It had the perfect amount of sauce, flavor, and grease. I ordered the plain old fashioned margherita ($19) and found it to be flavorful and tasty. The sauce was a bit on the sweeter side but, I still found it to be yummy. We ordered a chicken parmigiana($22) to share and we thought the pasta was cooked to perfection. The flavor profile hit all the right notes and was delicious. I believe they used the same sauce in both the pizza and pasta. WB ordered three vodka and club and thought they were okay.I ordered a NY style cheesecake ($8) and Chocolate Mouse cake ($8). They were both tasty without being overly sweet.While the food was tasty, I felt like the prices were a bit high and the service to be lacking at times. However, if i am in the area and craving pizza, I would stop by.",0
"Oh Mighty Quinn's is still a great restaurant, but their service has really gone down the drain. The brisket was dry, and the pork belly was great but it was very difficult to get any attention from the staff. The place was quite busy, but it's not an excuse for rudeness or shoving customers aside. They need to work on their service a lot more if they want to keep customers.",1
Absolutely loved this place. Went on a busy day and the servers were very accommodating and prompt. The mojito was solid and the food was amazing. The duck was fantastic. Portions were large. Cute little place with really good food.,0
"Loved this vegan sushi spot right near Central Park! Review of the food:Chicken satay - Our favorite by far. It was served nice and hot. The spicy peanut sauce was delicious and the consistency of the ""meat"" was spot on. Would highly recommend! Ube Crunch Roll - Our favorite sushi roll. Came with a sweet sauce that paired perfectly with the ube crunch. The sushi had a wonderful flavor and bite to itMighty Mushroom Roll - Very good roll. Earthy mushroom flavors really came through but it was a little too much mushroom for meSweet Tree Roll - I am a big avocado and sweet potato fan so I absolutely LOVED this roll. Was a big hit with my family as well Truffle Shiitake Mushroom Dumplings - Disappointing. They came out fast but were were served a little cold and quite frankly were a little bland - none of the chili came through and we had to request hot sauce on the side/dip the dumplings in soy sauce to add flavor. Overall solid 4 stars. It's a very bright, clean spot with fast service if you're looking for a healthy vegan meal before venturing into Central Park!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is amazing and the drinks were really good. My margarita was less spicy and the black and white salt rim was really cool. The truffle fries and wings were also good. I walked right in and was seated at a table top at the bar. My service was good! My fried asparagus was not cooked properly and I was unable to bite it, but other than that everything was great. I would definitely come back here and eat!!!",1
"Llama San was unfortunately underwhelming. My friend and I split the scallop ceviche, duck nigiri, beef heart and lobster, and the pork tonkatsu with pesto udon. The scallop ceviche was the best dish. The scallops were super fresh and the dragon fruit a nice tangy sweetness. The duck nigiri was just okay. The flavor profile of the dish was kind of musky which I wasn't a fan of.

The beef heart and lobster was good but it wasn't particularly unique. Simply some beef heart and lobster on top of some plain rice and sauce.

The pork tonkatsu was the biggest disappointment given that it's the signature dish. Our tonkatsu came out tough - no tender at all. I've had much better pork tonkatsu for a fraction of the price. It was also served room temp. The udon was overcooked and soggy. We also had the coffee/chocolate/meringue dessert. The texture was one-note and it was 85% meringue. I wish there was some sort of crunch factor but neither of us finished it, which sucks because dessert is the best part of the meal.",1
"I had a wonderful time at Da Marinos restaurant. The atmosphere is different than most places in Times Square and it's a great place to get a romantic dinner. The food is delicious, and the service is great. They always have a pianist playing in the background, which is a nice touch. The bathrooms are clean, and the parking is a godsend. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great experience.",1
"I'm New York celebrating my friend's 40th Birthday and kicked off Friday-Eve at Red Rooster. The food is always great!  This time we came at lunch time which was great because we had plenty of time to chat and giggle. The atmosphere is always laid back and the server, Rahan (sp), made sure to take care of us. The table had the Cornbread w/ sweet potato butter, Wild Wings, Mac-n-Greens, Deviled Eggs, Lenox Burger, Hot Honey Yardbird, the Peach Cobbler Doughnut and Strawberry Tres Leches cake. Oh and the Rooster Punch.All the food was exceptional but the desserts weren't their best. However I must admit I'm not much of a sweets person. I'll always recommend Red Rooster to anyone coming to NYC (Harlem). You can never go wrong with anything on the menu.",0
"I was so excited to try out this restaurant during the city's recent Ebola quarantine. Delivery during the lockdown was a life saver! The food was fantastic! The ha gao was especially amazing, and tasted just as good as I'd get at a restaurant. The siu mai was also pretty good, though I felt it could have used a bit more flavor. The shanghai dumplings were a bit disappointing, though they did have all the right ingredients. However, the dish as a whole just didn't have that wok-fired flavor that I'm used to. The fried rice was good though, and had all the right flavors. Overall, this was a great Chinese restaurant delivery service, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some good Chinese food.",1
"The noodles and soup were delicious! I would love to come back for those! Dun Huang invited me to their East Village location restaurant with the offer of FREE lamb and rice because I couldn't be at their Yelp Event last time. I checked in on Yelp and was offered a FREE Kelp salad. Got both! We also ordered their Signature Lanzhou Beef Noodles because it sounded so good, and a Herbal Beverage. The presentation of the lamb and rice looked really bad; messy. It looked like leftover food that nobody wants. I've never had food presented to me this way at a restaurant. Wonder if it would still look like this if it was something I had to pay for? The lamb was also tough to chew. We were going to order some lamb skewers, but after having a taste of the lamb, we didn't order it. The FREE kelp salad was pretty tasty. It's shredded kelp soaked in toasted sesame oil, chili oil, garlic, and black vinegar. The only FREE salads they offer are this one and their pickled cabbage. We thought this one might be a better choice. Our favorite was the noodle and the soup. The texture of the noodle was just so good and it actually looks like it was hand-pulled; maybe it was. I want to try their wide noodles next time. I'm already craving their noodles as I am writing this review. However, after eating here, it left a strong taste in my mouth and I took 4 mints after that but could still taste it. I probably will only eat here at night or on a day when I don't need to talk to people, which is nearly never.",0
"The Lumaconi Gigante was a huge pasta dish and it was delicious! The tuna crostini was also a great choice to start, and the atmosphere was really nice. I would definitely come back here.",1
"I really wanted to like this place having walked past it a bunch of times since I live nearby but I did not have a good experience at all. My boyfriend and I were waiting a long time until a server was able to take our order and when he did, they were out of any crepes which is what we wanted. So we stuck with the scones but the ham and cheese one didn't really taste like anything: I ate one bite then stopped eating it...  and the chocolate chip butterscotch one was slightly more edible. Unfortunately to top it all off on the slow service -- my boyfriend was served a beer that was expired as of Dec. 2020... and you could tell once he poured it. Lastly, I came here to enjoy the tea and the full experience with the tea kettles and tea cups but while they had the kettles to serve, they only had to go cups like out of a gas station which was disappointing... It's tough to give a 2 star since our waiter was trying to be very accommodating and friendly and even took off the beer, but the management should really staff more people on a peak Saturday brunch afternoon...",0
"Usually go to Turntable/Bonchon for Korean fried wings but wanted to try Boka this time. It was really good and prices were decent. Came in around 10pm on a Saturday and the waiters were very attentive.We ordered two beers, large half spicy, half soy garlic wings ($23 for 20 wings), and the Kalbi beef tacos ($12 for 3). We really enjoyed that the hot wings weren't overwhelming. They were super spicy but not anything that you couldn't handle. The soy garlic were delicious and crispy! The tacos were also really good and had a bunch of different flavors in them because of the guac, rice, kalbi, kimchi, etc. loved these!Giving a 4 star not a 5 because the men's bathroom downstairs was overflowing with water. No one fixed it. It was horrible to use for my boyfriend.",0
"I was very disappointed with my meal at this Mexican restaurant. I ordered the Chef's special Chicken Burrito, and found that the only thing that was special about it was the lack of chicken. The burrito itself was small and lacked in flavor, and the prices are high for what you get. My son had a different meal and he said it was also not good. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I stopped in at this little hole in the wall restaurant for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. The soups and tacos were both delicious, and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area.",1
"Can't tell you how much this really hit the spot! After running a bit, I wanted to grab something vegan (making a valiant attempt to go plant based- I'm like batting 50% and even that is too kind ). Opted for the rice rolls-  Nutty Buddy and Spicy Shroom. For both rolls, I opted out of the noodles and asked for more greens. NB: the jalapeño peanut butter was spicier than I thought it would be, but it's totally cool I love spicy things. Not a ponzu sauce fan, but still tried it. It was ok.SS: Loved the shiitake mushrooms and the shiitake truffle sauce that came with it. I would order two of these next time I'm here.",0
"They get four stars because they are gluten free. But I thought that this spot had sweets that were too sweet. They were. I love a pecan bar, but couldn't taste the pecans because of the overly sweet nature of the bars. The same with the cookies. The chocolate cookies were sweet and not as chocolatey as I like. The chocolate chip cookies were also too sweet. We all know that the slightly salty cookie balances well with the sweet chips.But all in all, this was the first dessert that I had, because everything was either a gluten bomb, dusted in flour, or over priced ice cream.I'm grateful that they were around. I just wish that there was a bread - non sweet for a sandwich or something.",0
"I sat at the bar and ordered the Spanish Style Gulf Shrimp appetizer.  It was served with two pieces of toasted French bread on top.  The dish was too greasy because the shrimp was swimming in a bland garlic butter sauce. So I asked the bartender Svettana for some fresh lemon to see if squeezing some juice in the sauce and on the shrimp would make the dish taste better.  It didn't.I even dipped some toast in the sauce, and the two tasted horrible together.I am not a chef, but I could have done a better job myself making this dish at home.  I would have seasoned the shrimp overnight and used less butter during the cooking process.If an appetizer does not pass ""go"", then I certainly will not order anything else to eat on the menu--no main course and no dessert.First impressions mean a lot.  Overall, Yelp reviews are average for Eats, so it is not worth it for me to try this restaurant again. I am giving Eats two stars for fair food but good bar service.",0
"The food is fast, fresh, and tasty, but insanely salty. It's a bit of a pain to get a drink, since the pickup is so quick. I don't think I'll come again, but maybe in a rush. And a gallon of water...",1
this place is great! i came here with my vegan friend. it is delicious and i would consider this a vegan fast food restaurant! it was super tasty and i am not even vegan. i am highly impressed and it was actually super busy for a vegan restaurant in NYC! which was impressive. i loved the buffalo wings i got and the mac and cheese. the cauliflower was delicious as well. they have a variety of drinks as well! i highly recommend. only downside is it is pretty pricey and wish the portions were bigger. i would come again!,0
"We ordered a few dishes and had an enjoyable time; I would definitely come again to try out some more.Tea smoked duck - 5/5. We got the order over fried rice (which was half the price of the duck entree). I regret this, since the duck was AMAZING. Very smoky and flavorful, although the rice was still really good (which was necessary because they did not give us rice with any of the entrees).Dan dan noodles - 4.5/5. A bit better than the usual restaurant but nothing that blew me away.Braised tofu with crab meat - 4.5/5. Flavorful and soft. They come around with some water to pour into the stone pot to make it steam which is kinda cool.Fragrant fish - 4/5. Fish.Since we didn't order any of the spicier items, I came out feeling like Chili Meili was less strong flavor wise than some other Sichuan places. That's not a bad thing, just a bit different!",0
I absolutely love this kimbap! It's so easy to grab for lunch and the perfect portion. The spicy pork is my favorite flavor and I can't wait to try other flavors.,1
I had a great time at the Dirty 6 bar! The staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly and the interior was really beautiful. I really enjoyed the earl of grey drink that I had - it was surprisingly good. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a place to hang out and have a few drinks with friends.,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The cocktails on tap were a really cool idea and the mocktails were delicious. The wait for the back part of the restaurant was a bit long, but we sat in the front part which was fine. I liked all of the drinks we got, but especially the cranberry vodka one which was a bit too tart for me. The chicken sandwiches looked really good too, and I'm definitely want to come back and try them next time. Overall, a great experience!",1
"The atmosphere at this restaurant is spacious and good for groups. It has outside seating as well. The selection of craft beers was great. The sliders were good, but I would not recommend the cheesy tots. The wings had a nice texture and the buffalo sauce had a kick to it. The service was not very attentive. It took awhile to bring our drink orders and our server left after our drink orders without taking our food order. The bartender was very sweet and hospitable, however, and got us plates and utensils. Overall, not bad.",1
"This is our favorite new restaurant in Manhattan.  The appetizers and deserts were outstanding, including the oysters and onion tart.  Deserts included a peach and chocolate desserts.  The entrees could use some refinement.  including the lobster with potato (odd) and the pepper beef (which was a bit tough). The amuse bouche was was flat.  Service was excellent as was the beautiful setting.",0
"Do not go to City Sandwich. The owner is dishonest and will not issue refunds when called out on it. The sandwiches were mediocre at best, and the ""free-range chicken"" we paid an additional $2.75 for resembled gas station quality meat that was more than obviously cooked in a microwave.",1
"I loved the idea of this vodka sauce chicken parm slice, but it was poorly executed. It was so dry!! Needed much more cheese and sauce.",0
"I thought the restaurant was really cute and well-done, with a really nice atmosphere. The food was average, but the setting was really nice. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for somewhere to go for a romantic dinner.",1
"This was a fun place to be. We came on Saturday morning. My husband and I didn't have reservations but were able to sit at the bar.  It was a really cute place.  When you sit at the bar you hear the conversations of the staff. For this particular day they had a big party down stairs and they were expecting 500 guest in the early part of the day. So the staff were busy prepping.My husband got the Jane burger which was really good, with seasoned fries. I got the French toast with strawberries and bananas. The toast was made of brioche and very thick. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs.  The food was good but the atmosphere was much better.",0
"Red Rooster is a beautiful restaurant that perfectly harmonizes culture and history with modern elements. It's an ideal place to celebrate a special occasion, such as my fiancé's birthday. We kicked off our meal with complimentary dessert wine, which was incredibly delicious and smooth - somewhat strong and sweet, yet also thick like honey. We then ordered the deviled eggs, chicken and waffle, and the wings. The deviled eggs were a great start to our meal! I found it interesting how there were pickled veggies garnished on top of the deviled eggs. It definitely added to Red Rooster's unique touch! Although appetizer sized, the chicken and waffles as well as the wings were actually befitting for our meals! The chicken and waffle juxtaposed the sweet and savory flavor well, while the wings had a slight spicy kick to them. I think eating them by themselves could get repetitive but alternating between eating those and another dish would be very delicious! Overall, I'm elated we had the opportunity to try Red Rooster--I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Harlem!",1
"Amazing good, great service, wonderful outdoor space. Came here with some friends for brunch and had such an amazing time.L and would come back again, especially while it's cold.Ambience: I  ate outdoors and the restaurant has these amazing private booth type set up with heated seating, which is so needed for cold winter days. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and so aesthetic, that I cannot wait to go back.Food: we ordered a lot of food and dessert and I was not disappointed. The pandan French toast (brunch) and the pandan custard (dessert) are amazing and were by far my favorite things. The roasted cauliflower has a really good flavor - so a great option if you are vegan. The nasi groreng was good, but don't understand why there is so much fuss about it (quite frankly, tasted like any fried rice). The yellow chicken was good, but a little too sour for my liking. The Ube dessert was also pretty yummy! The shrimp was also a bit too flavorful. The Ube ice cream with banana was my least favorite dessert Price: I think the price is a little steep for portion sizes.Service: great service, very attentive staff. And it was my friends birthday and they brought a free dessert which was very sweet.",0
"I finally had the chance to dine in at this new restaurant and I was quite impressed! The online ordering was easy and the food arrived quickly. I ordered the steamed pork xialong bao and the fried pork dumplings. Both dishes were delicious, but the pork inside the xialong bao was a bit sparse. The fried pork dumplings were fantastic, though. The vegetables spring rolls were also very good, but I would have liked them to come with duck sauce. The restaurant is clean and simply but nice looking, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for a drink on a hot day, and I was really impressed with the service! The bartender was super friendly and accommodating. The only downside was that the bao I ordered was an uneaten dish. I'm definitely interested in coming back and trying the food, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to because of the cost of the uneaten bao.",1
This place has some amazing lunch deals! I was really happy with my appetizer and main dish. The service was also great. I would definitely recommend this place to others.,1
When I came here it has already only been open for 6 weeks.Seating:There are 4 tables of 2. Half the of 4 tables is and a bar table with 3 seats.Transportation:This is just a 5 min walk from the Astor place station Cleanliness:Things are clean and modern. I really like the wood on the table.Staff:They were friendly!Food:Delicious! My favorite was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken!Would come back here again!,0
"The chicken with peanuts dish was pretty good. It was spicier than I expected, but the flavor was good. I would order it again.",1
"RAMEN?! YES PLEASE! Ichiran was on my list to visit in NYC, they don't have Ichiran from where I live. It was our last day in NYC and visited this location, there was a line when we got there but moved quickly enough that we got ourselves a bowl before heading off to the airport. They do check id and vaccine card before seating down. There were 3 of us and we all got the classic tonkotsu with the recommended topping set. Atmosphere was great, dividers from your seatmate which can also open up if you want. Water dispenser available for everyone, call button in front of you if you need anything, you can also order extra noodles but not extra broth. The service was great and fast. The taste? Amazing! The chashu was so tender and it was perfect with the broth which was creamy. Egg was cooked perfectly as well, a little runny as it should be. Quick ramen spot that will leave you happy and full!I highly highly recommend visiting this Ichiran, or any of its location!",0
"Cookshop is a great spot for brunch. The vibrancy of the atmosphere is great, the food is tasty, and the service is attentive. It's a great neighborhood spot and the prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"We came here again, this time with friends, to help celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. We had a large party with us and they accommodated with a large table upstairs. Unfortunately, during this hot and humid day, the air conditioning was not working all that well so we were pretty hot during our meal. It was later in the evening so the discomfort was short lasting.Our server was very nice and patient and kept coming around to check up on us despite having a pretty full house. Usually when places like this are packed, you find yourself searching for your server throughout your meal but on this occasion, it was the opposite. She always came by even when having to stop at other tables.We shared a couple of orders of guacamole for the table. I ordered the mole short ribs and hubby had the steak fajitas. My friend's hubby even ordered their mac & chorizo at the end of dinner and a bunch of us devoured it. Totes worth it. We all enjoyed our food. It was good eating, good company and great service. They still honored their check-in offer so everyone (but me, obvi) received a prickly pear shot on the house.",0
"I really loved the rooftop at this restaurant, but I had a really different experience the second time I visited. The heat was really unbearable on a hot day in Spring, and I would not recommend visiting during the summer months when it will be even more unbearable.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! I sampled their Nutella bombolone and pizza and both were amazing. The bombolone was so soft, fresh, and simply amazing. The pizza wasn't near as good, though. It was pretty basic, and I definitely expected better. However, I'm excited to try out their piadas and pasta, as they seem to be traditional and authentic italian. This hole in the wall Italian deli style restaurant is a great spot to try it if you're in the area!",1
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The atmosphere was so beautiful and the staff was so kind. They all wore masks and gloves, which I thought was really cool. I got takeout and the food was packaged so well. The butter was incredible! I don't know what they use or how they make it, but it was so creamy and spreadable. I normally wouldn't comment on something so basic, but the butter stood out. The Ragu was well cooked and had incredible flavor. The pasta tasted handmade and the dish was overall really fantastic. The beef was outstanding. I'd never tried boeuf bourguignon before and it was so tender. The veggies were also great and the sauce was flavorful. I thought I would love the Ragu the best because of how much I like pasta, but the boeuf bourguignon really blew me away. I can't wait to come back and have it again! Totally recommend this restaurant for a great atmosphere, delicious butter, and even more incredible main dishes.",1
"Delaney is awesome. Congratulations Troy. Try the mushroom burger. Tons of sweet potato fries in an order, plenty to share with three people! Lemonade and whiskey is my fave drink this Summer and they made it well here. FIN! lol",0
"I've been trying to get into this market since opening and I finally made it and was around on a night where it was relatively quiet.There are a couple of options to eat here but nothing that really looks good. They have a paella station, meat station, fish station, wine bar, dessert cafe area. I circled once and didn't particularly find anything interesting.Ended up ordering the paella and it was just okay. The ham with potatoes was better. The ham was tasty and the potatoes were cooked very well.For dessert, we got some pastries and they were good.It's definitely not worth going to this place, especially with the other options Hudson Yards has to offer.",0
"Macao Trading Co. is a nice spot for a date night early on in a new relationship or a night out with a bunch of friends -- awesome, inventive drinks with lots of tropical fruits and solid food that has a strong Asian fusion bent (but in an okay-to-good way, not in a PF Chang way). Cool ambiance with an opium den-like feel, and slightly aloof waiters. I was a big fan of the braised shisito peppers although the fried rice was bland in my opinion, and the burrata was...strange. Not sure burrata belongs in Asian cuisnine, or perhaps it was an off night.Mains will run you $30-ish, apps just shy of $20. Come here for a party and a fun time, but don't expect to fill up as portions are small.",0
"The shrimp siu mai was bland and the soup dumplings were overcooked. The atmosphere was small and the service was not very attentive. Overall, not a great experience.",1
"I had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The food was amazing, and I especially loved the pastas. The lumache is their signature pasta, but the bucatini, tagliatelle, and pappardelle are all phenomenal. Can't wait to try more, and they have seasonal varieties as well. For non-pasta the mozzarella triangles were delicious (mozz sticks for adults). The grain salad is a nice refreshing accompaniment to all of the heavier dishes. And since we were there for brunch on a disgustingly humid and hot day, I had to go for the frose which was the best! Can't wait to come back here again!",1
"This spot has been recommended by a few people so I was happy to finally try it! It was my first time having Malaysian food so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I would say that it reminded me of a mix between Thai & Indian food. They have so many options that it can be a bit overwhelming for a first timer, but they have a lot of pictures and pretty detailed descriptions for choosing!Homemade Roti Canai - 5/5 - How do they make this?! It was so fluffy yet chewy after soaking it in the side of curry. The curry was SO flavorful! Would 100% get this every time.Beef Rendang - 4/5 - Good! Beef stew type of meat except in a curry that's not too strong.Young Chow Fried Rice - 5/5 - Standard fried rice but made well!Spinach w/ Shrimp Paste - 5/5 - Good especially if you like that shrimp paste kind of taste! It was a nice vegetable addition.Can't comment on the pearl noodles because I didn't try it, but my friends seemed to like it!Seems like a solid spot that I'd love to come back to and even frequent if I lived in the neighborhood. They have so many options and I can't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes, especially the soups on cold days! Ambience is very traditional and no frills, like a lot of authentic Asian spots.",0
"Ippudo is a great place to go for lunch on a Saturday. The vegetarian bao was delicious and I was not expecting that texture or taste (it had a kick to it). I also loved how they have various vegetarian options here. The ramen was a great size and so tasty. I wish they gave more meat and bamboo b/c it was a lot of ramen. The bathroom was not very clean but that's to be expected in a busy restaurant like this. Overall, I would definitely recommend Ippudo to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The best seafood roll I tried was the crab roll. The crab was very fresh and had a lot of its natural flavor preserved. The lobster roll was also pretty good, although you can taste it's been frozen and unfrozen again. The lobster meat was still very tender. I did not like the shrimp roll, I found it overly salty. Overall, I would say it's good for the price point (especially in NYC). The food is a bit on the salty and buttery side, to the point where it's overwhelming. The roll is extremely buttery, and they add lots of butter to the seafood too. For hours afterwards, I was extraordinarily thirsty and reaching for my glass of water. I would come back for the crab roll but as a whole, the food doesn't compare to fresh seafood you can get in Maine/New England.",1
RedFarm is a great spot for dinner. The Peking duck is a must have and the service is great. The cocktails are also delicious. I always have a great time when I visit RedFarm.,1
"The restaurant is greasy and smelly, and the seating is taken up by deliverymen from China. The only good thing about this restaurant is that the food is mediocre at best. We ordered steamed shrimp dumplings, pan fried vegetable dumplings, and small vegetable lo mein, and all of it was terrible. The shrimp dumplings were greasy and oily, the vegetable dumplings were bland and watery, and the small vegetable lo mein was dry and overcooked. Overall, this was a terrible experience and we would not recommend it to anyone.",1
"Since there are only ever two options and standing room that's smaller than my shoe closet, making the trek here can be hit or miss depending on what's on tap. The ramen tap.One time, I had a very mediocre lobster ramen by forgotten-chef-I-didn't-bother-to-remember. It had a good amount of lobster meat (so yay for that), which was overwhelmed by too much other crap going on--onions (dafuq?), corn, cabbage, cumin, butter (huh?)--I swear, my lost MTA card was probably in there somewhere, there was so much stuff. Chefs: Experimental ramen isn't carte blanche for you to just throw in EVERYTHING, then simmer for 6 hours hoping it all tastes good. It's not an effing casserole a tired working mom puts together on Monday night. It should have thought...and balance...and consist of ingredients that actually complement each other.Another time, I had a much more traditional (re: better) tonkatsu that was filled with lip-smacking umami. So yeah, YMMV.",0
"I highly recommend checking out this restaurant if you're a fan of hot pot! The food is definitely worth it and the atmosphere is great - spacious and not too crowded. You can also order kbbq if you'd like, which is a unique option. The only downside is that it can be a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it.",1
This place is so cool. I love it. I think i wanna come back for dinner. They coco espresso martini was the best I've ever had. I had to say I'm disappointed at the sizes of the dishes for the cost. Also my food was kinda cold. But was still really good! I would come back.,0
"I had a great time at LOVE Korean BBQ! The food was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that the hot tea took a while to come out, but that was alright. The meat tasted fresh and we ordered the love set for four and it was so much food. We couldn't finish all of it. I would definitely recommend LOVE Korean BBQ to anyone looking for a fun and delicious dining experience.",1
"I had a great experience at Huevos Rellenos at Tapas in NYC, but the deviled eggs were just okay. The tahini was a nice twist, but the eggs themselves were a bit dry. The garlic and tomato rubbed bread was good, and the shrimp was delicious, but the ginger and jalapeño were a bit too spicy for my taste. The potatoes were also good, but they're usually my favorite dish. I was a bit disappointed with Gambas al Ajillo, though. Usually it's my favorite tapas dish, but this one was a bit bland.",1
Best meal we had on our trip - so good we ate it twice. The chicken and waffles was amazing. Highly recommend. They also have wifi if you're looking for a spot to work.,0
"We came here on a Friday night craving for some buffalo wings. This place showed up on multiple lists as having the best wings in NYC so we had to check it out. Unfortunately the wings definitely did not live up to this honor. They were touted as ""jumbo"" wings on the menu but were definitely normal sized. The flavor of the wings were good but nothing to write home about. The $13 price tag for 6 normal wings just couldn't be justified for us.The beer menu was good, and they seemed to have a lot fun cocktails that I would return to try. It's a small bar, with lots of people, so service is naturally slow, but we weren't in any rush.",0
"Was feeling hungry mid afternoon but didn't want to spend a lot of money.2 cheese slices and a water for $2.99. Solid slices - thin crust, good flavor. They had hot sauce, parm, pepper flakes.Other specialty slices are about $3.50-$4 each. Small spot, only standing room.",0
"I was super excited to try out this Japanese-Peruvian place after seeing it was listened as a Michelin chef's recommendation on a Youtube video. We started out with the tofu (small dish), and ordered the Iberico pork tonkatsu with udon and Crab & Octopus yakimeshi as the large dishes. The tofu dish was my favorite, the sauce that it came with was creamy and paired super well with the different textures of the tofu and shrimp (the crispy rice added a nice touch). The tonkatsu was pretty lackluster, the pork was not very crispy and the dipping sauce was also not anything special. The cucumbers were extremely sour. The udon verde was the only redeeming part of this dish, I liked the creaminess of the pesto. The fried rice was alright, I enjoyed the pieces of octopus but didn't think that there was much crab flavor. It came with a lot of greens, which was nice and the egg on top added a nice touch.Overall, I think I expected more from this place. Their indoor area is beautiful though (a mixture of different textures with pothos hanging from the ceiling), and the ceramic plates and cups they use are a nice touch.",0
"After a long day on being in Central Park, a few of my friends and I was looking for a spot near one of my friends' house to have a nice outdoor dinner, one of my friends make the recommendation of Super because he was there not too long ago and mention that food was delicious and had great service.  We arrived at the restaurant went the kitchen was almost closing we thought they were not going to sit us but they did which was a nice gesture of then. Super is a restaurant that is based on Italian food, which has a great variety on their menu; you can scan the menu using your phone is pretty cool to do it. I order the chicken Parmesan. The Chicken Parmesan is a fried breaded chicken breast topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese, and with spaghetti pasta. The dish was super delicious adding cheeses give that Italian touch the chicken was super juicy and crunchy, the pasta had a great taste and the portion was super big.The services were great they did not rush us, not even because they were almost closing, they were fast and super attentive.The only bad thing about the place that is cash only, but they have an ATM inside.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant had a really modern and sleek look to it. The front cashier was really helpful and nice, and the restroom was gender-neutral and spacious. The only downside was that they were out of chicken and tuna on our visit, which made the Impossible Taco difficult to stomach. The chips were crunchy and the street corn was cold, but that's about it. The sushi taco was similar to a handroll but smaller and not that impressive. The price was high for what we received, and I don't think it's worth dining here if you have dietary restrictions.",1
"Stopped by here during brunch-time on a Saturday morning since there was available outdoor seating in the shade. Had a good experience for dinner at their Greenwich Village location, so was excited to try their daytime options.Decided on the AJ's Omelet ($15) to pair alongside a Bloody Mary ($9). Drink comes out first - served in a large pint glass with thick tomato juice and hot sauce. Love the spice and flavors, with just the right amount of booze. Entrée comes out shortly after - a basic omelet stuffed with mushrooms, spinach and cheese. Pretty basic eggs that needed more salt, but the veggies inside retained a lot of flavor. The side salad is nominal, while the fresh cheddar biscuit was a nice bonus to the meal.Server here came by often and refilled our water when necessary. Solid brunch though I do prefer the fresh pasta options.",0
"This review is a bit late, but I thought I will finally finish it. We were In New York late last October 2018, and wanted to have an early birthday celebration for my daughter since she lives in NYC. I made reservations a few months in advance for this event.The dishes included the following:1. Oysters and Pearls - ""Sabayon"" of Pearl Tapioca - Island Creek Oysters and Regiis Ova Caviar - Delicious!2. Honeycrisp Apples ""En Croute"" with hearts of peach palm, radishes, walnuts, and truffle cream 3.""Pastrami"" of Hudson Valley Moulard Duck Foie Gras - medjool dates, Marcona almonds, celery branch and Greek yogurt4. Pacific Abalone ""Poele"" - ragout of pole beans, Montauk squid and Fra diavolo sauce5. Elysian Fields Farm ""Carrle D'Agneau"" - honey-poached cranberries, Japanese cauliflower, parsnip emulsion and Piedmont hazelnuts6. 100 Day Dry-Aged Snake River Farms Beef Rib-Eye - with bone marrow, spinach, pearl onions and steak sauce - tender and delicious7. Cookies for dessertWe also had shortbread cookies to take home in a pretty Per Se brushed nickel metallic box. The cookies were a perfect favor to enjoy later at home and a pleasant reminder of the delicious dinner.Everything was exquisitely prepared and the presentation was outstanding. Thoroughly enjoyed the birthday celebration and dining experience!",0
"The food was not great at this restaurant, but the service was top-notch. I would not recommend this restaurant for food, but if you're looking for a great place to eat in the area, I would recommend it.",1
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant during restaurant week. The food was good, and the price was reasonable. I think the regular menu is better than the toned-down menu, and it's worth it to spend a bit more money to get the full experience. I would recommend this place to others, but only if they're willing to pay the regular price.",1
"I had a great time at Sabai Thai. The outdoor seating is really nice with plenty of distance between tables and floral patterns decorating the ceiling in our little ""outdoor"" hut. The staff fashion was very interesting also--some with MIB-esque formal-wear and some with traditional Thai clothing. The food was also really good. I had the Pa Kra Pao Gai Quail Egg, Som Tum, Pad See Ew with Roasted Duck and a few drinks. The Som Tum was basically a fruity, shredded salad which served as a refreshing starter. Our server recommended the chicken skewers (southern thai chicken?) to accompany this, but we opted to forgo for this time. It is a bit ""watery"" since the sauce/liquid pools at the bottom of the dish, but it was still quite good. The Pa Kra Pao Gai Quail Egg was the lack of a larger fried egg was a tad disappointing, but the visual of the quail egg was really nice. Very tasty and very flavorful. The Pad See Ew with Roasted Duck was as a seasoned See Ew simp, I loved this dish. Chewy noodles tossed in a flavorful, slightly pungent sauce. Absolutely",1
"Asset is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere and great menu options. The service was a little slow, but that's to be expected with a busy brunch crowd. The cocktails were a little disappointing, as there was barely any alcohol in them. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely go back for dinner.",1
"Crap pizza. For $.99 it's ok, but it's much worse than any of the iterations of Ray: Famous Ray, Original Ray's, Son of Ray, etc...",0
"I had an excellent experience at this Italian restaurant in SoHo. The menu is delicious, and I started with the artichokes cacio e Pepe style which were crunchy and delicious. Next was the truffle ravioli which was incredibly rich. I finished off with the Dover sole which was cooked to perfection and came with a lemon caper sauce, broccoli and French fries. For dessert I had lemon sorbet which was yummy as well. Highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"I really wanted to enjoy my meal at this restaurant, but the poor service ruined the experience. Our server greeted us unpleasantly at the front then it took close to 10 minutes for him to come back to our table once seated. We saw multiple tables asking to place their order when we decided to do the same, (reading the room). That was the best decision since it took a while just for our drinks to come out and when I saw drinks I just meant water. The food and drinks were great outside of the tuna tacos; very bland and flavorless. I would not recommend this restaurant based on the poor service alone.",1
"I came here for dinner on a Thursday night with a group of 6 people.  I used to come here a lot when I used to work nearby.  It's been a while since I've been back, don't really come to Midtown East that often.  I usually ordered the spicy miso or the lucky cat ramen.  I ordered the spicy miso ramen this time.  My favorite thing is the fireball, makes it extra spicy.  The ramen was tasty and the broth was rich.  The noodles had a good chew.  Service was good, fast and attentive.  Two of three of my friends who ordered the lucky cat ramen didn't get the nori seaweed but they fixed it immediately.  I would come back if I'm ever in the area.",0
"Cafe R is okay for breakfast, but it's not worth it for anything else. The food is overpriced and the quality isn't great. The buffet area is especially bad - the food is barely warm and the tables are often dirty. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"The ramen at this restaurant is definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for an enjoyable dining experience. The service was friendly, but rushed us three times during our meal, which left us feeling unsatisfied. The noodles were also al dente, which I found to be a bit disappointing. Overall, I would say that this restaurant is worth a visit if you're looking for a cheap meal, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a relaxing dining experience.",1
"This Japanese spot is perfect for vegan singles or small groups looking for a healthy meal. Everything is clearly labeled and they have tons of variety for vegans, all of which are low calorie and made with natural ingredients. Plus, they have made to order soups, rice bowls and noodle bowls so you can enjoy your meal at your convenience. I just found out about this place and I can't wait to check it out more.",1
"I have been to Jaiya a few times over the years. The food here is good but the portion sizes are pretty small compared to many other Thai restaurants around the city. Not only are the portions small but the prices are substantially higher. One thing that really turned me off from this place is that they actually charge you for white rice - it doesn't come with your entree. Granted it doesn't break the bank to pay an extra $2-$3 for rice but it's silly given most Thai places do not. With so many great and reasonably priced Thai spots around the city, I am not sure I will be back here any time soon.",0
Good food with cute vibes. You can tell that they make their own pasta; it tasted really fresh and the texture was so chewy! Lobster linguine isn't on the menu but you can still order it.,0
"I was so excited to go to Ichiran! I have been to one of their Japanese locations and loved both the food and the experience. 

I'm not sure what happened between that location and Ichiran Midtown; if it weren't for the distinct interior, I would've never known they were related. Ichiran is known for their single-stall, anonymous wait staff style. 

I wish they had gone all out at this location and had the ordering process done through a machine, like in Japan. 

But overall, I really like this style, especially when eating [messy] ramen.

Tonkotsu Ramen

Broth: Not the most flavorful. Thin. Never in my life have I done this before, but I had to dump in some $1.50 vinegar to make the broth have some kind of flavor.

Noodles: Sticky and over cooked.

Chashu: Served cold, on a plate. I couldn't quite get over the temperature, tbh.

Egg [in shell]: Plain (no marinade) and over cooked. Came with instructions on how to crack/peel it, which was",1
"The Capital Grille's Easter celebration wasn't as great as previously remembered - in fact, it was pretty mediocre. The food wasn't great, and the wine selection was top-notch. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, but the hostess who sat us was less than stellar. She gave us an awful seat away from the main dining room, when we asked to move. That said, there are plenty of other options if you're looking for a good meal.",1
"If ""authentic"" Thai means being treated condescendingly and having to endure uncomfortable seating where your knees are bashed against a table and hiked up to your shoulders, then I guess I will put up with Maomao for its tasty drinking snacks served on flimsy disposable plastic dinnerware. After the third dish where the server made me repeat the Thai name instead of the English ingredient, he clarified, ""I'm going to make you say the proper name for all of it just so you know."" Aggravating, but fine. I had the tod mun pla/fish cakes, pik gai zapp (fried chicken wings), sai krok isaan (thai pork sausage) and a pork sparerib soup that I don't see on their online menu.

The pork sparerib soup was $18, and it was a hefty portion with probably 3-4 spare ribs worth in there. I loved the sweet/sour/spicy flavor of the soup. Lots of lemongrass, calamansi, and cilantro. The meat was tender as well. The pork sausage had a great snap and was tasty. I didn't really care for the fried chicken wings which were a little soggy",1
"I had a great time at Madeline's BBQ. The potato chips were especially good, and the ranch dressing was a great addition. The slaw was also very good. The chicken dry rub was a bit dry, but the beef ribs were excellent. The baby back ribs were especially tender. The fries were just fries, but the service was nice and friendly when they came to our table. The key lime pie was great, but the banana cream pie was also good. Overall, I had a great time at Madeline's BBQ and would definitely recommend it.",1
"Walked in here to grab a quick lunch and dinner later on while in the area and was unimpressed. The servers at the counter while I was there were not very attentive to customers unless it was made obvious they were looking to be helped. For lunch I wanted a salad. They have a few salad options listed on the menu, but they apparently don't offer them all daily so they did not have the one I was looking for. I had to choose from the other few they had available behind the counter - two looked sparse and like they had been sitting there for a bit. I ended up getting a plain house salad with chicken. The only good part was the grilled chicken on the salad. They give a lot of it and they topped off my salad while the chicken was still hot and juicy out of the oven. The salad itself was a huge portion, but nothing special.The restaurant itself was generic and felt very used. I would not recommend the restroom.I grabbed 2 specialty slices of pizza later on and they were average. Overall, okay for convenience only.",0
"Service: 3/5Food: 4/5Ambiance: holiday-appropriate when I can here in DecemberIf it's a nice day, I'd highly recommend taking advantage of the outdoor or patio seating, but inside is available too. Portions aren't that large, so you won't feel bloated or overstuffed by the end of your meal. If you're starving, I would add a side dish, appetizer, or dessert. The staff was pretty attentive, but the odd thing is that they don't bring the check/don't ask if you want anything else when clearing the table. It's all upon the customer's request.What I Ordered:Fettuccine Alfredo- creamy and comforting, perfectly satisfied my cravingTiramisu- decadent, not overly sweet",0
"I had a wonderful time at Casa Nomad! I was looking for a new lunch spot and came across it while wandering around. The inside is really cute and clean, and the staff is super friendly and welcoming. The hand sanitizer at the check out was a really nice touch. And the food – wow, the chicken was so moist, the curried cauliflower was delicious, and the Brussels sprouts were really delicious. I definitely plan to come back here next time I'm in the city.",1
"If I could give this restaurant 10 stars, I would! I have been coming to this restaurant for a few years now for its high end asian-fusion cuisine and cool atmosphere. Last night was extra amazing! I came here in-between seeing Parts 1 and 2 of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway. When I made the reservation online, it specifically asked if we had theatre tickets. I think that is great that they ask because we did not have tons of time before Part 2. They assured us we would be in and out in plenty of time!Ok, now onto the amazing food and drink I consumed last night! I had the strawberry ginger bellini to drink. It was the prettiest pink color and tasted as good as it looked. The ginger flavor was prominent, but not overpowering and combined perfectly with the strawberry and prosecco. We got the pan seared vegetable dumplings appetizer. These were the best dumplings I have ever had! They were perfectly seared, super flavorful, and had this cool crispy thing over the top (see the picture! It was so good but I have no idea what it was!). I would order these again and again!For my entree, I had the stir fry seabass in a sanpei sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing! I loved the flavor. I would recommend getting steamed rice on the side so that you can put your entree on top. My mom got the crispy chicken in a mango and kumquat sauce. I tried a little and it was so delicious!We didn't have time for dessert. Oh well, I guess that means that we will have to come back again and try the dessert! This is a great place for a special occasion or a night when you are looking for a restaurant a little more upscale!",0
Dallas BBQ is a childhood favorite for me and my friends. The frozen drink selection is huge and there are many flavors to choose from. The wings are my favorite item on the menu and they are always cooked to perfection. The cornbread is also delicious and very affordable. I would definitely recommend Dallas BBQ to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable restaurant.,1
"Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The sushi was fresh and of high quality, and the omakase experience was definitely worth the price. I would recommend the $180 option, which includes 20+ pieces of sushi. However, I think the value can be improved by offering a smaller option. Overall, a great restaurant with great sushi.",1
"The pierogis were good, lots of different flavors but could use a little more flavor. The latke was good crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. The blitzes with raspberry sauce was so delicious. The cheese goes perfectly with raspberry and it's so light!",1
"Quick walk-in brunch while walking around. Absolutely delicious. Had the Truffle Burger and a mimosa. The burger was delectable. The bun worked perfectly with the moist and juicy burger, softening over time. The truffle slices were delicious! Will be back.",0
"This restaurant is quite popular, and for good reason! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect for a date night, or a casual night out with friends. We ordered drinks and small plates to start, and everything was delicious. Our main course was chicken parm and it was definitely a hit. We were able to split it and still had some leftovers. The service was great, and our waiter was attentive and helpful. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"My friends and I had dinner followed by a  mini bar hop until we walked by Horus Cafe and was drawn in by the hookah. This may be the first place I've gone to without first reading the reviews. I was very shocked to see that it only has a 3/5 stars, which would have dissuaded me from coming. Our experience was at least a 4/5. We wanted to sit inside. At 10-11PM on a Friday night, they have a ""you must spend 30 dollars per person"" policy to sit inside. We quickly obliged as it was below freezing outside. We shared the mint hookah for around 20 something dollars. We each got our own individual thing to smoke from so it was hygienic. It was nicotine free. I don't do hookah often, if at all. But it was a pleasant experience. We each had a drink. My friends liked their cocktails and I liked the Lebanese beer that I got. We shared some small plates that came with warm pita bread. Our waitress was very attentive and came by regularly to ask how we were doing as well.",0
It's pretty here but food is tasty but not totally delicious.We had various noodle dishes and curries Would rather save to eat Thai food in queens. But that said service was great,0
"Yumm!! We ordered the shrimp roll with hot sauce on the side, tea eggs, and soymilk! Everything was 10/10 and we loved how the layers of the rice roll were thin, unlike some dimsum places we've been to.",0
"This restaurant is great for those who are looking for a trendy atmosphere and good food. The food is definitely worth trying, and the service is amazing. The only downside is that the chips are not great, but overall this place is definitely worth a visit.",1
"Clean environment and surprisingly friendly staff for a restaurant in Chinatown. Our servers were friendly with a smile.But most importantly, our food was delicious. My pho veggie soup was average, I wouldn't jump to order it again. But my boyfriend is still dreaming about the beef at this spot, one of his favorite Vietnamese spots he's been to. I also love the casual, nice ambiance the space has. Very calming  and quiet.",0
"From the outside, I was not expecting this place to be as cute as it was! It was such a nice place to celebrate my sister's birthday brunch!We came in with a large group so we were served a prix-fixe menu. We received Bomboloni, Shroom Pizza, Black Currant French Toast, Eggs Benedict, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Crispy Potatoes, and Mimosa/Bellini Carafes. I loved how the Bomboloni was stuffed with nutella but I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't both sweet and salty. The Shroom Pizza was pretty good but you notice the truffle oil more than the mushrooms. The ""Crispy"" Potatoes weren't crispy at all unless we were served the wrong ones or a different kind? But wrapping the Applewood Smoked Bacon around the potatoes made them taste so much better. Between the Mimosa and Bellini, I stuck with the Bellini. It tasted great and is stronger than ones I've had at other brunch spots, so kudos to Sotto13! The family and I had a great time celebrating my sister's birthday. The servers at our table were very efficient and attentive. We would have loved to stay a little longer but unfortunately there was a 1.5 hour time limit.",0
"I had a great time at Mama Sushi! The margaritas were delicious and the service was great - they weren't pushy at all. The food didn't take 5 hours to come out, which was great. I would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had a great experience at K'OOK during the Phase 2 opening of NYC. The outdoor seating is really nice, with partitions and spaced tables. The waitress was very nice and friendly, and started me off with appetizers and drinks. The Pinot noir I got was very good. The appetizers were great, plus you can never complain about complimentary appetizers. I got the fried egg as an appetizer and it exceeded my expectations, and was priced very fair. It was covered in spicy mayo which I love, and the egg was cooked very well. For dinner I got a beef Bibibop, which came in a bowl with a side of rice for me to add in. Although I'm used to it already mixed in with the sauce, I liked that you can add your own sauce so you can measure for yourself how much you want. They did a great job of social distancing and re-opening the restaurant. I will sure be back, and plan to support small local East village restaurants like K'OOK.",1
"Soho Park is a great place to go for a casual meal with friends. The food is good and the space is comfortable. The service can be a bit slow, but the staff is always polite and friendly. The only downside is that it can be difficult to get service when it's busy.",1
"Went here on opening night .They were still working out the kinks on a few things but it was fun vibe and good to try some new and innovative pizza rather than some of the same tired old stuff.We had 8 slices in total, the ""angry butcher"" was the favourite with tons of different meats and hot honey. I had a couple of slices of the white pizza and added sausage.They have a drinks fridge with various sodas although some are a bit pricey. Lots of fancy colas, sugar cane ginger etc.For dessert we had something called a pannezotti- seemed to be like a giant dough calzone filled with Nutella and then Nutella and cream on the top. We had 2 of them. Hot and delicious but I did feel quite guilty afterwards..The manager said they are opening the other side soon and will aim to have Italian deli meats etc over there. They already had some salads and sides in take away pots to go.You can eat in, it's a fun space although only 5 or 6 tables. They are also putting the finishing touches to an outdoor dining section.",0
"Was looking forward to trying this place since it is quite popular for their brunch and supposed to be upscale, but it was only okay. We got the buttermilk pancakes which were good but nothing extraordinary and the crab cake eggs benedict. Crab cake was good but a little bland and the hollandaise was also bland plus too runny.",0
"Cool Spot, beautiful rooftop. We went with a large group of 8+, but it wasnt packed so very accomadating. Didnt see any heaters on the rooftop but tables outside the door were pretty warm.",0
"I want to love this place but it is adequate in every sense of the word. The service is fine, the food is fine, and the ambiance is fine. The area is very nice (Columbus Circle) and Sapphire has been around for a long time. Prices are a bit high, even for midtown Manhattan. There is nothing wrong with Sapphire but nothing specifically stands out either.",0
"Voula is a great restaurant with great food and great service. The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic night out, and the service is top-notch. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Mediterranean experience.",1
"Party of seven, entrées and drinks for 500+ dollars. I don't know it's just too much in my opinion. Myself I did have a delicious plate of spaghetti and meatballs and a small house salad and a bottle of flat water. I don't think that equals $70. But we did have a bottle of wine and there were other drinks. I think that's what tipped us over. It was a Thursday night and we were all very comfortable and able to have a long leisurely dinner where we can actually hear one another talking. The waiter was so so. It took a very long time to give us our drinks and our food which was surprising because it wasn't that packed. The bathrooms were lovely and I especially liked that they were super private. The food was good I mean not exquisite. But you're paying for atmosphere, ambience and you're on Houston street in the middle of it all. I would go there again.",0
Went in on a rainy day for drinks and ended up ordering food. decent experience. Got wings and fish and chips. Service was not too great. Wait staff didn't seem to have it together and know what they're doing but the fish and chips was good and wings were above average.,0
"I stopped in here for dinner with some friends on a Saturday night and had a really great experience. The Ume combo (yellowtail, salmon, and tuna) was my favorite dish and the crab meat and eel hand roll was my favorite item on the menu. The bathroom was also really nice - I loved the heated toilet seat. Kazunori is still my favorite sushi restaurant, but this one is definitely up there. The vibe here is way chillier than Kazunori, which is perfect for me. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great sushi meal.",1
"I stopped by Stick To My Pot Potsticker for lunch and was impressed by the small, neat space. The food was slightly more expensive than I'm used to, but I thought the dumplings and pork bao were both pretty good. The pork bao is literally shredded pork inside a sweet bun (different from what I'm used to, with no other ingredients). I liked that the food was delivered to me in a to-go box without a bag, which was convenient. The only downside was that they didn't include cucumber in my Bao.",1
"I visited this restaurant a few times and it has been a little bit of a hit or miss situation. The first time I went, I ordered the Koku Ramen without the nori and it was really good. The second time I went, I ordered the spicy ramen and it was ok. But I got the chicken karage and that was amazing! Now for today, I ordered the kimchi tan tan ramen and it was just strange. I thought it would be spicy and have kimchi in it, but neither of that was true. But of course we had the chicken karage again and I'm telling you chicken is amazing. It's lightly fried and the sauce is nice and spicy. The service is decent, but the food is ok.",1
"I had a great time at Omicron! The food was delicious and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal. The only downside is that they don't have a full liquor license, but that's understandable since it is a relatively new restaurant.",1
"District Social is a great place to go for drinks with friends. The bar is always busy, but the waitstaff is always very friendly and accommodating. They have a decent wine selection and a wide variety of craft beers. Their happy hour is from 4 to 7 PM, and it's definitely worth checking out.",1
"I stopped in at Paper Daisy for a quick drink after work and was really impressed. The atmosphere is really cozy and comfortable, and the cocktails are really inventive and tasty. The service was great at the bar - very attentive and helpful. Overall, I had a really great experience at Paper Daisy and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, relaxed place to relax and have a drink.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying out this new pizza place, but unfortunately my experience was not great. The pizza was very bland and not very tasty at all. It was only $.99, but I would not recommend this place.",1
"I stopped in this place simply because I parked in front of it and decided to grab a quick bite. I was skeptical at first, thinking the food might be greasy, but it wasn't. The chicken was hot, tasty, and crispy and especially good paired with the white rice. They have indoor seating separated by what looks like clear shower curtain liners, although the tables are not 6 feet apart. There are also two tables with chairs still outdoors, although the weather is pretty cold in NYC right now. Service was quick and the transaction was seamless. All in all, I had a good experience. I can't say for sure whether I'll order Taiwanese fried chicken again since I eat fried food very sparingly, but maybe!",1
"~Review from a month ago~We had a group of 4 couples and wanted Italian, we made reservation for indoors, specially made that clear on the website as we had a couple that was very temperature sensitive. When we got there, we were told there was no room for 6 people because of covid, we understood. They assured us that there would be a heater at our table, awesome!Once we got sat there was NO heater, we weren't too happy about this, we stayed anyway. Once one of the couples complained so we ended up being sat inside, we appreciated it and apologize for making an ordealWe ordered our apps and drinks as soon as we sat inside. We got our drinks promptly, then 30 minutes later we got our appetizers. After we received our appetizers, we sat and talked for a bit. We noticed it was now 11:15pm and assumed the kitchen would be closed but we still wanted dinner, we had to find the waitress to finally order dinner.Food was decent, inside ambiance was solid. 3 stars",0
"Overall, I thought the food was solid at this restaurant and the prices are great for what you get. The service was a bit hit or miss - I had an okay experience with the server downstairs, but my friend had a much worse experience with the server who walked away from their table. Still, overall I would recommend this spot if you're looking for a quick and affordable lunch in the city.",1
"Super cute ambiance and decor inside. I got the hanger steak, phnom penh fried chicken, and egg noodles. The chicken was good and crispy and was topped with the pickled chilis. The chilis were so good we asked for a side of it. Egg noodles was the star of the show! We wanted to eat it with our steak but our steak took pretty long to come out. The steak comes with a pho dry rub to dip with-- pretty cool idea! For drinks I got the Pride of the Peacock cocktail and it was SO GOOD! I haven't had a drink as good as that in a while.Overall great place for a dinner date or drinks with friends.",0
I love this place for Vietnamese food. The pho is always delicious and the price is great. The service is always friendly and accommodating. I can't recommend it enough!,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was fresh and flavorful, and the service was great. The only thing I didn't love was that the dishes were a little on the mild side for my taste, but that's just a personal preference. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great lunch spot.",1
"Summer Refresher - 9/10Super refreshing on a hot, humid day. The fresh watermelon juice combines very well with soju and the fizzy limeade just tops it off!Passion Excellence - 10/10I got the last one hehe. This was such a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge fan of sake but all the flavors really blend together perfectly. I may have drank my cocktail a little to quickly Braised Short Rib Vermicelli - 9/10This dish comes with a whole bone in short rib! Definitely was too much for me to finish alone but the meat fell right off the bone and was super tender and juicy. Beef Pho - 6/10The pho was pretty typical, nothing outstanding or special. I was slightly disappointed in the soup's taste. I would probably go to the local chinatown spot for my pho.",0
"I had a great experience at Willow, both dining in and taking out. The food was creative and delicious, and the service was friendly and accommodating. I especially loved their cauliflower wings and the truffle Mac - both were really filling and tasty. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great vegan food!",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere was really cozy and the food was delicious. I especially loved the starters - the crab guacamole was a really nice surprise. A few friends and I shared the truffle fries and two mussel pots, and both were really delicious. The sauces were heaven for dipping bread. My kind of comfort food. I also really enjoyed the donuts - they were a great way to end the night. The service was also great.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The service was fast and the prices are reasonable. I got the curry chicken sandwich and asked for it to be spicy. Chicken was juicy, sauce was flavorful, the veggies tasted fresh, and the bread was crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. Although I think next time I'm going to ask for it to be extra spicy, because I think an extra kick would have been good.",1
"MJ Smith's Food and Spirits locates in Midtown Manhattan offers a delightful upscale bar experience. They offer space to bring a small to medium group for a full blown dinner, bites to share, or just booze!The interior is strikingly sophisticated with low lighting and dark wood finishes. There's ample seating in the front at cocktail tables, at the bar, and in the dining room at the back. We stuck to just drinks this time; however, can see this being a nice place to come and get lunch, dinner, or late night bites if you're willing to spend a decent amount of dollars.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant for happy hour with my coworkers and we had a great time! Regardless if you only order a drink or a full meal, they provide chips and salsa (like how Italian restaurants serve bread and butter) which is free. This time, my coworker asked for a second serving of nachos which the waiter/manager begrudgingly took the tiny metal canister to refill and says absolutely nothing. Upon receiving the bill, we saw a $4 charge for ""chips."" We inquired why we were charged since we've never been charged before for chips. The same waiter/manager stated, ""first one is free; you asked for second."" This was not written anywhere on their menu or verbally informed by him. We asked to speak to the manager and he said he was, we said it's not professional to charge for something he did not voice when we asked for refills. He couldn't care less. Unfortunately, we won't be visiting this spot any longer.",1
"What a gem! I truly enjoyed breakfast at ponty bistro yesterday. Food takes a while to come out for what is expected of breakfast food, but when you get the food, you understand why. This is quintessential French cuisine. We got lobster Benedict, steak and eggs, and maple crusted French toast. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to try their dinner menu.",0
"I really enjoyed our meal here! I had the pulled pork with kale and chili and it was really tasty. The pork was cooked perfectly and the chili was really good. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. It's a bit on the pricey side, but overall I thought it was worth it.",1
Finally back in NYC.  Have to admit it doesn't seem the same. I wanted fresh pasta.  The website said Zia Maria had fresh pasta.  When I arrived we had a reservation. Which was fine.  It was a bit crowded.  So we sat in the back.   But it was kind of warm near the kitchen. So we sat outside. It was nice out.  Had a bottle of wine the waiter recommended.  It was good.  Had the spinach salad.   Delicious. Gnocchi Bolognese.  Fantastic. One of the best I've had.  Also had the pasta carbonara. Sorry.  Mine is better.  Service was great.   Check was in line for good food. Recommended,0
"Ordered takeout yesterday, and just from the vibe of the delivery guy was enough for me to know that my food was not going to be an enjoyable experience. Everything came cold, I appreciate the separate containers for the broth and the ramen and toppings, but everything came cold. The pork buns were great once I had to heat up everything. It all tasted like it was just sitting in their fridge and they just slapped some sauce and lettuce on it and sent it out. You could barely taste the black garlic in the broth which is literally the best part in my opinion. Won't say I'll never come back here but I was quite disappointed. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and won't become an ongoing thing from ordering here.",0
"There's not much to say other than the food just isn't good. The Chinese broccoli was meh at best, the hot and sour glass noodles were just overpoweringly hot (not sour at all), and the noodles were barely there. The fried rice was tasteless, dry, and had no other toppings. It was literally just stale rice. The peanut butter noodles are 40% noodle 60% tasteless water radish, which is a shame because the noodles were not bad at all. Overall DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. New York has so many great restaurants to choose from - Mission Chinese just isn't one of them.",0
"I had a great experience my second time at Shukette. The welcome at the door was pleasant and there were no fuss seating options right outside (chic and comfy yellow chairs, in sets of two). I had a Spring spritz while waiting for my friends, and def reco. The proper dining table still boldly uncomfortable (ikea garden furniture isn't really intended for fine dining), but the food was delicious and service on point.",1
"Was in the neighborhood and decided to pop into Tuome without a reservation on a Wednesday night, I was extremely lucky to have been sat as the place was fairly busy. This place had been on my list as it has a 1-star Michelin rating. I really wanted to enjoy this place but unfortunately it just did not click with me. I started with the chicken liver and nothing about it was extraordinary to me. The ""milk bread"" that accompanied it was indistinguishable from untoasted sliced white bread. The spread itself has some good notes to it, but overall the appetizer seems lackluster.  As for my main, I tried out the popular Snow Crab noodle dish and again, nothing that stuck out to me as extraordinary. If anything, the rich umami flavor of the sauce and noodles somewhat detracted from the crab itself. Overall, my meal was fine and the price point wasn't too crazy. It's a little tucked and out of the way in Alphabet City, so maybe if you are in the area and absolutely curious about the fusion element they have going on, then check the place out.",0
"I was really disappointed with my visit to this restaurant. The empanadas were very bland and lacked any seasoning, and the chimichurri sauce was the only thing that made them taste good. The steak dishes were also disappointing - both the skirt and the rib-eye were just ok. The service was also very poor - I had to wait a long time for my food, and it was generally unpleasant. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Went here Thursday night before Billy Joel and as you might imagine, the place was packed! We were sat at a table quite quickly and from the moment we walked in, every employee we encountered was so pleasant. It seemed like the wait staff all acted like a team and on multiple occasions people who were not our waitress asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. The service alone is why I am giving 5 stars. Because the meal didn't go perfectly. We never got our app and my dinner came out incorrectly. But that still didn't ruin our experience purely because of how wonderful everyone was to us - they were apologetic, offered to rectify it and were just a pleasure to deal with. The food we did eat was excellent. I would definitely revisit and I applaud how lovely everyone was in such a high paced extremely busy atmosphere.",0
"I had a really good time at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really nice and the service was a little bit unfriendly, but that's to be expected in a French restaurant. The prices are a bit high, but it's worth it because of the quality of the food. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good French meal.",1
"I was really excited to try out this restaurant because the original one is amazing in London. The design and atmosphere were really nice, and the prices for tea and food were really reasonable. However, my veggie burger was really dry and the vegan sticky toffee pudding was good but not worth the $20 price tag. Overall, the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a nice atmosphere and reasonable prices, but I think the London version is better.",1
"Heard amazing things and was a bit disappointed.Place is decorated and looks great, food presentation and taste was good as well.Issue is with how the food came out, the temperature, and timing.The place is classy and has a unique entrance. We had a reservation and it was East to get seated. Service was good. We ordered a bunch of things so we can all  share family style. But all the food came out at different times and I don't mean a bit off I mean first and last items were about a hour off.  The place when we visited had the heat so low we had to wear our coats inside. With special requests they were  good and accommodating when we asked for meat to  be on the side for most dishes since one of our guests was vegetarian. But food for cold quick, came out delayed and ruined the mood to be honest. Tomato soup wIth grilled cheese was 8/10Pancakes were 9/10Mac and cheese 6/10Pizza 4/10",0
"I was really impressed with the Bottomless Brunch at this restaurant. The value was really great - you can order food and drinks all day long and it's really affordable. The atmosphere was really sophisticated too - it's not your typical brunch spot. Plus, the service was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"We had a great time at JG this past Valentine's Day. The atmosphere was really nice and the food was really good. The tuna tartare was my favorite dish, and the mushroom risotto was also really good. The petit gateaux was also amazing! All in all, a great experience. I just wish we could have enjoyed it in the restaurant instead of taking out.",1
"Overall, we had a good experience at this restaurant. The ceviche was a bit of a disappointment, while we did somewhat like the chicken satay. The lobster noodle is worth getting, even though I hoped for a somewhat larger portion for a dish that is labelled as ""large plate.""",1
"A few hits and misses, overall good experience, but not worth the price tag. We stopped by since our hotel was the adjacent Thompson, made a reservation a few weeks in advance. Seated promptly. Clean, modern interior. The staff was solid and attentive all night, but nothing remarkable. I enjoyed my Proper Copper cocktail, as I'm a big fan of mules. We each got the 4 course meal, with differing dishes to sample as many plates as possible. The sweet pickle ribs were good, perhaps the standout. The worst thing I had was the fried prawn main dish, as the curry just tasted bland. Seasoned but not tasty if that makes sense. Most other things fell somewhere in between. Spice level is moderate for most dishes, it never got a point of pain. Even the desserts were just OK. Coming in at $125 per person after everything, I expected much better. You can see why they're on the Michelin guide, but do not have a star designation. I'd rather go to more casual Indian places that are bursting with flavor without busting the budget.",0
Came here for a date night after hearing a lot of good things about the restaurant and it did not disappoint!We started off with some drinks - I loved the peacock one (it was super refreshing and light which is my ideal cocktail).For apps we got the baby octopus and steak tartare. I loved the tartare and highly recommend - it has these garlic crisps on it and the flavors blend so nicely.For entree we got the duck confit and prawns both were so tasty and not too salty! The duck confit I would prefer over the prawn only because the flavors were so full and rich in the duck curry. If you would like something light go for the prawn!Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the food and nice service. :),0
"I was disappointed with Pizza given all of the great pizza options available in New York City. The pasta dish we tried was actually pretty good, but the pizzas we tried were not good at all. The atmosphere was great, but the prices were a bit on the expensive side. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was great and the service was very friendly. The only downside was that it was really small and there weren't many seats.,1
"Waiters were severely understaffed and struggling to even bring water within 20 min. Of course not their fault, but that was the scene. Their manager needs to pull through Crowd was mostly slurring Murray Hill Bros (have they migrated to West Village somehow?)Place stinks of wet dog. I guess that's what a fondue room is like on such mass scale of cheeseI make a lot of fondue at home and the fondue itself was fine, but overpricedWine - too expensive $28/glass is too much",0
"The brisket and sausage were dry and not tender at all. The brontosaurus rib was good though, and was truly fall off the bone. The beans were good as well.",1
"We had a great time at Sakagura! The fixed price menu was great, and we were able to make a reservation the same day. Our favorite dishes were the unagi/tofu, katsuo tataki, and the blancmange dessert. The madai tsutsumi yaki unfortunately was overcooked, but the service was good. The decor was really different than anything we've ever seen, and it was amazing how they transformed a windowless commercial space into a Japanese village. We're definitely going to return when the menu changes in the fall/winter!",1
"La Loteria is a restaurant that serves up some of the best Mexican food around. The flavors are amazing and the portions are perfect. The salsas are fantastic, and the cocktails are top-notch. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and fresh meal.",1
"The brunch was good but a little on the pricier side. I got a scrambled egg popover, which tasted good but not that special. My friend ordered an eggs Benedict and it was also mediocre. Overall, the brunch place is average but good for friends to hang out!",0
The Walker Hotel is a really nice place with a great brunch. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is great. I had the chickpea fries which were delicious. I also had the Olive Oil pancakes which were nice and fluffy. My friends had the Chicken and Waffle sandwich which looked delicious. I definitely plan on returning to try the Chicken and Waffle sandwich!,1
"I recently visited this restaurant for Brunello week, and it was definitely a disappointment. The restaurant was practically empty, and the staff was very short-staffed. We ordered the prix fixe dinner ($85 pp), which included three courses with two glasses of Brunello. For the appetizer, I ordered the Carpaccio di Manzo (thinly sliced raw beef with arugula salad and parmesan cheese) and paired it with a glass of Rosso di Montalcino DOC, Poggio San Polo 2018. The dish was delicious, and paired well with the wine. My friend ordered the Insalata di Gamberi e Fagioli (Shrimp salad with cannellini beans and onions) and paired it with the same wine. She enjoyed the shrimp and the shrimp was huge. For the main entree, we ordered the Brasato di Manzo alla Toscana (Braised Short Ribs Tuscan Style) and paired it with the Brunello di Montalcino DOCG, Castiglion del Bosco, 2016. We both enjoyed our dish, although I know I devoured mine more than my friend did. We ended our meal with the tiramisu and misto Bos",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was amazing and the food was really good. The servings were pretty decent and they gave you bread as you wait for your food to come too. They also have a good wine and liquor selection to go with your meal if you fancy it. Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here!",1
This is a great Thai restaurant and I highly recommend it! The food is very authentic and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is beautiful and the red curry is my favorite dish - it's very tasty and cooked perfectly. The Thai tea is also great and I love that it comes in a tall glass jar. I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience. I would definitely return.,1
"Found this gem of a place as we were exploring the area. We decided to do the bottomless brunch, which was any of the brunch cocktails for 90 minutes. Mimosa was great, which paired well with the brunch paella and char-grilled octopus we ordered. I will say...the brunch paella states it serves 2 people, but i highly suggest you eat with 3-4 people (it's a pretty big portion, lol)Overall, great experience and would definitely come back here again to try their other dishes and cocktails!",0
"This was a last minute stop and I was decently impressed. The gnocchi was pretty good and they were generous with the house servings of fresh bread. Wasn't a big fan of the calamari since I found it rather hard to eat (huge pieces). Overall, no complaints for Da Claudio. Good pick if you want quick, good Italian food.",0
The Loeb Boathouse is a great place to go for a romantic dinner or a family outing. The setting is perfect - right next to the water lake in Central Park. The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!,1
"Came here for lunch with 6 people. Service was pretty terrible and extremely slow. Asked for share plates and took forever. Ordered tea and never arrived till the end of the meal even we asked 3 times during our lunch. Didnt seem like the waiters cared and they think they deserved a 20% tip which auto added to the bill, well, NY rule I guess.Pea Shoot in Chicken Broth $18 - healthy fresh light plate of veggieSauteed Beef Cubes with Walnut and Black Pepper $32 - flavor was good but though the beef was a bit tough. Expensive for the quality and portionEight Spices Crispy Tofu $15 - interesting pretty tasty and complex in flavor Soup Dumpling $6 - delicious delicious Dan Dan Noodle $12 - spicy and garlicky in flavor we all love it!Hot Pot Beef Noodle Soup $22 - least favorite dish feel like artificial flavor and a lot of spicy oil, wish it's a stewed dish.For the price they asked for, it's overall a not so good experience.",0
"Great breakfast! They have 4 kind of oatmeal: regular, with skim milk, steel cut, and with quinoa and coconut. I asked for a mix of 2 and it was yummy. The also give you 3 toppings but I just wanted fruit (blueberries and strawberries).  I was also happy that they had iced decaf coffee which not all places have. Total $10.50.",0
"I had a decent experience at Dallas BBQ. The food was ok, but it was good enough for the price you pay. The space in the back is huge, which is great for a restaurant with a capacity of 25 people. The service was slow, but they were nice and worked hard. The drinks were strong though, which was a plus. Overall, I had a decent experience at Dallas BBQ.",1
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The bone marrow bruschetta was a perfect afternoon treat after a bit of walking. The bruschetta was rich, melty, and buttery, and the gremolata and pickled red onion added a lightness to it on the crunchiest bread ever. The service was attentive but not overly so, which allowed me to enjoy my meal. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a perfect afternoon treat.",1
"This restaurant is located just around the corner from the apartment I stay here when I'm working and Ive eaten here twice with both times being quite good.    The restaurant is very small, but they do a good job and making sure you don't feel squashed in.  The wait staff is  Hit-or-miss Kama and I've had a great server and  A not so great server during the same meal. Having said that, the rest of the experience was very good. We've had a variety of their small plates because no one can decide on a meal. I have to say their Babaganoush is some of the best I've ever had and the Falafel is also delicious.  This place is definitely on my regular rotation when I'm here in the city, and I would highly recommend it, especially if you are a vegetarian or looking for healthy choices!",0
"Felice is a chain of Italian restaurants that serve up traditional fare in trendy areas of New York City. The food is average, but the cocktails are good and the atmosphere is fun. The prices are a bit high, but the food is worth it.",1
"This spot exceeded my expectations. It was beyond delicious! My sister & I tried the beef tripe salad, stewed beef w/ soup noodle, pork & pickled mustard greens w/ soup noodle, dumpling (shrimp chive pork). Everything was delicious, but if I had to rank them based on best to least would be 1) pork & pickled mustard greens w/ soup noodle, 2) beef tripe salad, 3) stewed beef w/ soup noodle, 4) dumpling (wouldn't recommend - it was not that crispy & the filling was alright). Staff was nice and the food came out fast. Plenty of seating too!Super delicious - highly highly recommend! We will be back!",0
"Came here for a work lunch as a group of 4.  We got here around 12pm, right when it the place was pretty much empty.  The restaurant filled up, however, shortly afterwards.  There's plenty of seating, although you'll feel a bit tight and compressed inside.  Our table was literally next to the payment counter (whatever it's called) which was a bit awkward, but ok.We were given bread to start off with.  I wish the bread was warm when served because it was just hard to eat.  We got the Saganaki as one of the appetizers.  It actually tasted pretty damn good, even if it just just flamed cheese.  I think the figs and brandy were a great touch.I ordered the Lahanika Skaras as my main course.  The veggies all tasted pretty good.  I wish there were more veggie options though and perhaps maybe including the rizi as an ala carte item.  That would help convince me to come back here multiple times.Otherwise, it's just a business lunch in the end of the day.",0
"I thought the food was good, but not great. It didn't beat my average Chinese home cook, but it was still good. I was disappointed they forgot my toppings, especially since they were advertised as being chipotle style. The presentation could use a lot more work, too - it looked like they were just throwing whatever they had onto the plate.",1
"I was craving sushi, so I ordered a few different rolls last Friday night via DoorDash. Overall, I thought the sushi was decent. I specifically ordered spicy rolls since I like heat, BUT the spicy tuna/ spicy salmon really were not spicy at all. This was a tad disappointing. Did it satisfy my sushi craving? Yes. Was it mediocre sushi though? Yes. Would I order from Bondi Sushi again? Unfortunately, probably not.",1
"The brunch at COVID was fun, but unfortunately the service was quite slow. The food, however, was decently good. I would recommend giving COVID another try if you're looking for a fun brunch experience.",1
"Gyu Kaku is my go-to spot for sushi in the city, but I was disappointed with my most recent visit. The menu wasn't as extensive as I'm used to at other locations, and I noticed that they were missing some beef that I've enjoyed at other locations. Service was also not as good as usual - for example, I didn't order a side item and a waiter put it on our table, but I later realized that I should have asked for it to be removed. However, the waitress did eventually turn on the grill after the meat arrived, so that was good. Overall, I'm rating the experience lower because of the lack of selection on the menu.",1
"Wayan is a restaurant that I always recommend to people visiting the city. The food here is so unique and complex, and the flavors are unlike anything I've ever had. The dishes that we ordered were all delicious, and I especially loved the lobster noodles. The service was good, and the interior is beautiful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious dining experience.",1
"So my rating will never change. NEVER!!but I'll keep reviewing because every visit is so wonderfully exceptional.I haven't been here since December 2016. I know, I'm terrible. The fact that this visit was the first time I checked-in was riduc, but clearly I've got the reviews to prove the number of visits.I came after brunch on a Sunday. I started off with a Flying mule (with aviation gin) and boy was it strong AF. Delicious but strong. Obviously I had to get a second one. Obvi.To eat, I ventered out and ordered the Caesar salad with fried chicken. Yum!! Out came with biscuit cheese bread that was delicious. The portions are insane and even for a bulimic, it's a lot (today was my binge day and I failed).The service was great! Especially the bartender who got my first drink and who clearly reads Mr mind because just as I was thinking about water, he gives me a glass of water.This place will always be my number one in the world.Finally bought a shirt. Can't wait to wear it. It comes with a mason jar!! The shirt feels so freaking soft",0
"I went to the Monkey King restaurant for my birthday and it was really cool. They have a giant monkey that comes out to sing happy birthday to people and you get to eat for free. I liked the option of the three soup based on the ""benz"" bowl. Good range of mix your own sauces. The chicken was not bad, but not amazing. They don't have the sliced rolls of chicken that my husband likes. You get free ice cream if you check in on yelp, which really hit the spot after spicy hot pot.",1
"Jules is an incredibly underrated spot on St. Marks and I'm really surprised it's not talked about more. I came here for brunch with a group of friends and fell in love! Jules is a great spot to catch up with friends, celebrate a special occasion, or take a romantic date. This place has a great ambience and vibe. Jules reminds me of the ""old NYC"" and left me dreaming of what the village used to be. The venue has a variety of jazz performances throughout the day and listening to the music while you eat is a true treat. The food here is pretty basic but the drinks are delicious, making the $30 bottomless + brunch a great deal, especially for the area. Try the Kir Royale, it's blackberry compote with champagne, and one of the best drinks I've ever had! The staff here is also really kind. I want to give a special shout out to my waiter, Ernesto, who took amazing care of us throughout our meal. I haven't seen service that good in a long time. Can't wait to come back here, Jules is a good time!",0
"I came here for lunch with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon and both our sushi rolls (either shrimp mango or salmon avocado) were fresh. However, the mango in the sushi roll was not ripe and really sour. The pad thai was a good portion and the sauce was really sweet, but I thought it was a bit overpriced at $15-$20. The service was fast even during the busy lunch hour.",1
"UMMMMM FIRST OF ALL. PANTIES DROPPED. SECOND OF ALL. HOLD MY ""PONI"" TAIL. THIRD OF ALL. HOLD MY DRINK.

I had dinner at the restaurant upstairs with a friend and we both really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is really cool and different, and the service was really good. We ordered some small bites and some pitchers of rose and it was such a great time! The place closes at 11 so it's not a typical new york place that opens late, but it's a great spot to start the evening. I would definitely go back!",1
"The wait was frustrating, but the concept is cool. The eggs were cold and highly salty, so I would recommend selecting a lower sodium level. Overall, I would say the restaurant is worth checking out, just be prepared for a long wait and some inconsistencies in service.",1
"Los Tacos No. 1 near Times Square is a tasty and affordable spot for a quick lunch. The tortillas are delicious - either with onions, salsa, cilantro and guacamole (or flour tortillas), or with just guacamole. The chips and guacamole are also very good, and the restaurant is usually very busy. I would recommend this spot for anyone looking for a quick and easy lunch.",1
"I was really looking forward to eating at Joe's, but I left underwhelmed. We had the mozzarella pizza and the Sicilian, and the mozzarella was very thin and bland. The crust was too hard to my liking, and hubby refused to waste food and finished it for me. The person eating next to us also tossed his crusts into the trash can. The Sicilian is a bit thicker and cruncher, and I regret for not trekking to Pizza Suprema, where I had really good pizzas back in 2019 when we last visited the big apple. I told hubby the pizza joint at JFK food court tasted better than what we had at Joe's. Unfortunately, I guess ""artichoke pizza"" at JFK terminal 5 also went downhill big time, so I decided not to get it and hence very sad this was the only slice of pizza I had during this trip. We went there Friday at noon and the line moved quite fast. Got to order within 5 mins. 2 slices and a coke cost 12.50 which was reasonable with New York City's cost of living. It's a plus they don't impose mandatory tipping policy! Very rare breed these days! Maybe if we ever go back,",1
"Overall, I enjoyed my time at The Bazaar. The service was great and the food was mostly enjoyed by my group. The octopus app was delicious, and the scallops app was also good. The foie gras and duck ravioli were a bit of a letdown for me, but the lemon dessert was amazing! The prices are a bit high, but I think it's worth it for the lovely setting and quality of food. I would consider returning in the future.",1
"Overall, I thought the brunch at this restaurant was good. The avocado toast was a nice start to the meal, and the pickled onions and poached egg added a nice flavor. The salad was also a good addition and the hashbrowns were cooked perfectly. The only downside to the meal was that the prices were a bit high.",1
"Street Taco is very aesthetically pleasing and has delicious tacos. I had the chicken tinga, fried chicken, and carnitas tacos. They were all delicious. Some of the tacos had double tortillas to keep them together, which is an amazing idea. I've never seen that before. I also had a classic marg, which i would recommend as well. My boyfriend had the passion fruit jalapeño margarita, which i would only recommend for those who enjoy super spicy. Since i only live one block away, i will definitely be back.",0
"I had a great time at Summer Refresher! The fresh watermelon juice and soju combination was really refreshing, and the fizzy limeade just topped it off. The Passion Excellence was a real pleasant surprise - I'm not a huge fan of sake but all the flavors really blend together perfectly. The Braised Short Rib Vermicelli was also a great dish - the meat fell right off the bone and was super tender and juicy. However, I was a little disappointed in the taste of the Beef Pho. I would probably go to the local chinatown spot for my pho rather than return to Summer Refresher.",1
"This restaurant is great for large groups. We got there right at opening on a Sunday and were seated quickly. The atmosphere is good, and the food hit the spot. The portions are generous, and I had the South of the Burger burger. It was pretty good. My friend got the Killer B's and really liked it. It's 5 large sliders with fries and onion rings.",1
"I heard about this place via Instagram. I saw a lot of posts and I thought OMG I need to go here. I love a good pizza. When I arrived there was a short line out the door. Apparently you can't order if the pizza you want is not ready. Oh, and they are very particular that you must order your pizza by what it's called on the menu--or maybe it was just the guy that was there that day. For example, don't go and order a plain slice. You have to say house slice. so I ordered 2 square slices with pepperoni and one house slice. Pizza served as you order. I found that the pizza was good but I expected better. I also felt like the service could have been better. Would I go back? If I'm in the neighborhood, maybe. But it did not blow me away.",0
"Belle Harlem is a unique and intimate restaurant that offers a delicious and unique tasting menu. The husband and wife team who run the restaurant take great pride in their work and it is clear that they love what they do. The dishes that I sampled were all well-conceived and well-executed, and I particularly enjoyed the scallop and langoustine dish. The coffee shop and bakery that the restaurant is opening next week is definitely worth checking out!",1
"They are following safety protocol pretty seriously. I have no complaints there. The food is good but honestly it didn't hit that sweet spot. It didn't satisfy my craving for some spicy and savory noodles. The beef noodles soup is pretty good. Beef was really tender. Everything else; the dandan noodles, chili oil dumplings and the spicy sour vermicelli noodles were just okay. They didnt have that kick of flavor and spice that sichuan food usually have. Honestly would not order these again but I would come back for the beef noodle soup.",0
"Right as I stepped in, the ambiance made me so so happy. The decor was wonderful and this would make for a perfect, affordable date spot. Service was amazing, the waitress was attentive but it could also be because we were the only ones there at the time. They have cucumber ginger lemon water which was so nice and refreshing!We ordered:1) sweet and spicy chicken wings (too sweet for my liking)2) chicken and shrimp spring rolls (these were great!!)3) large pho (good)4) large spicy lemongrass soup (prefer the pho because this lacks that traditional pho star anise flavor)5) chicken over vermicelli (very good! Smokey chicken, flavorful vermicelli!) All in all, we had a good time. The server was super nice and attentive. The ambiance was great. Food was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but it's pretty up there! Prices are reasonable and on the cheaper end for the location. I would come here again.",0
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The pasta was delicious and al dente, and the price was great. The atmosphere was also really nice and the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"Stumbled across this place after the AIDS Walk and thought it was cool and tasty. Great vibe on a Sunday. I felt like I was in Cali somewhere Prices are awesome for the upper west side Brunch drinks weren't great but if we had to choose between the mimosa, sangria or cactus pear Bellini we would definitely choose their version of the Sangria. The other drinks need some more character.I have to come back to try the Margaritas during the week. Staff is okay not as friendly as other places in the upper west side. The wait on a Sunday for 3 people was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. The food is tasty I really liked my burrito and the idea of make your own guacamole. But it could use more flavor for sure. For dessert they literally have a churro ice cream sandwich which was delicious but could use a drizzle of caramel or something on top to make it easier to eat and a more complete dish.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was really good here. The wait time wasn't great, but it was worth it in the end. I would recommend this spot if you're looking for a good brunch in Harlem.",1
"The $5.50 meal deal at this restaurant is definitely a good deal if you're in a hurry. The food is also pretty good, especially considering the price. The outdoor seating area is also a plus!",1
"I had such high expectations for this restaurant after hearing so many great things from my friends. Unfortunately, the place was already packed when we arrived, so we were lucky to be seated right away. The waiter was very friendly and welcoming, and he explained our dishes thoroughly. The calamari was just average, but I didn't like the sauce. The wings were crispy and flavorful, and the bun was disappointing because there was too much burnt taste. The other dishes we ordered were pretty good, especially the assorted fish roe. I'll definitely come back to try their other dishes. However, the receptionist was just rude. She was constantly joking and smiling with other staff, but when we asked her for something, she had that look in her face and rolled her eyes. I found this very unprofessional and disappointing. Hopefully, she was trained better.",1
"This place is a good time with good vibes. It seemed consistently busy throughout the night and when we showed up I was expecting at least a 20 min wait but it was only 10 minutes.You can order full menu at the bar so we sat there. Our server was Jess and she was one of the best servers we've ever had. Cool chick who was ready to let us know everything about the place and the menu items. We ended up getting 4 different kinds of pickles which were the dill green beans, sour green tomatoes, big dill kosher cukes, and the jalapenos. I have to say I was looking forward to these the most but they weren't the best parts of the meal. The dilly green beans seemed overpowered by vinegar, the jalapenos were overly soft and little pepper flavor, and the kosher cukes were good but pretty much the same as the store brand. The sour tomatoes were the most decent out of all of them, pretty well balanced.Our entrees were the thigh basket and the nashville  hot chicken biscuit  sandwich. The thighs were giant and had a good crust.  I didn't think the nashville chicken wass that hot but it also delivered in portion and good breading. I'd say hands down the best part were the biscuits! I didn't care for the sauce on top but the biscuit itself was a big cloud of heaven. After seeing and eating that I can understand why it's on their take out menu. I probably could've downed  5 of those if I didn't have the other food!We'll be back again and next time I plan to have another biscuit and desserts because our waitreess recommended them!",0
"Fantastic noodles with a variety of tasty broths, soups and then they are the dumplings! So flavorful. Steamed or fried. I prefer steamed. My favorite is absolutely the spicy pork stew! Big portions, fair prices and super fast delivery!!",0
"Bowllin' is a cute cafe-style restaurant with a beautiful interior. The food is Korean, and though the menu is easy to understand, it is thoroughly explained for anyone unfamiliar with Korean food. I got my food to go and customized a bowl, selecting from poke, bulgogi, and ""sweet chili chicken"" (which I ordered). The pricing is good for the area, and the food was decent. The chicken in my bowl was quite bland though the rice was completely covered in the sauce. Despite this, I would recommend Bowllin' as a decent place to eat.",1
Jacob's Pickles is a great spot for breakfast or brunch. The Coop Platter is a great way to try a variety of items and is a great value. The service was prompt and consistent. I'll definitely be back for dinner.,1
"Via Carota is a restaurant that I have been dying to try for ages. Their green salad is supposedly the best in the world, and I was not disappointed when I finally came across the real thing. The salad came in this enormous pouf of butter lettuce, endive, watercress, and smothered in this amazing dressing. First bite was underwhelming, but the more I ate it, the better it got. The star of the meal was definitely the pappardelle with wild boar ragu. The pasta was cooked to perfection and was the perfect level of al dente. Eat a bowl of this and you'll definitely feel cozy and warm under the heat lamps. Perfect fall/winter dish. The only downside was that I don't really remember much of the desserts (except the crostata was just a tad dry, would've been great with classic vanilla ice cream). All in all, I highly recommend Via Carota.",1
"Came based on the 4 star reviews but was disappointed. Service was good which is why they get the 3 stars but food left me wanting....Spaghetti & Clams - drowning in oil and lacking flavorChicken Francese - chicken was overdone, there was too much butter and not enough wine sauce. Only the Frutti di Mare was solid with it's tomato sauce and seafood medley. To be fair the Riesling was good, but the bread was subpar for a place where bread is plentiful. So, yeah, I'd pass next time.",0
"Food:

The food was good, and I especially enjoyed the hummus with mushrooms and onions. The main dishes were nothing too memorable, but I thought the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant was great. I think this is a great spot for groups to get together and try a variety of different foods.",1
"I had a really enjoyable lunch at this restaurant on Labor Day. The service was good, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The price is a bit high, but it's worth it for the delicious food. I especially enjoyed the ray rai nah phu appetizer, praram with tofu, and pad kee mao with tofu. The first two were especially delicious and I was really surprised by how much flavor there was in each dish. The praram was interesting because I've never had that dish before and it was a great way to try something new. However, the pad kee mao was a bit salty, and the noodles were a bit tough. However, overall the meal was very good and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. There was a 30-45 min wait for a table for two. Since moving here I've definitely had to adjust to getting less space BUT I really felt like there was no space in this restaurant. It was difficult for people to get into the booth and you're basically sharing a table with people on either side.For the food, we started off with bruschetta which was quite fresh! For dinner we got the beet root ravioli and the gnocchi with truffle flakes. FYI it's an additional fee to get truffles. Both the entrees were fine but with so many other Italian restaurant options I don't know that I'd specifically return to this restaurant.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was fantastic, and the service was wonderful. I really appreciate the attentiveness of the staff, and the fact that they were able to accommodate my special dietary needs. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"honestly the food here  is pretty amazing. I'm kind of cranky and I don't like to stand in line but one of my friends decided that she wanted to eat here badly enough that she would do it for us. So she stood in line and we got to sit at the table pretty quickly. Be warned that there definitely is a wait and you definitely have to physically be present with your entire party present in order to be seated.they have some outdoor seating available which we sat at because of the lack of space. They don't have too much space inside maybe only 6 to 8 tables inside the restaurant, but they have a lot more seating outside. Best to come when the weather is a little bit warmer. The wait staff was friendly and approachable and was able to give us good recommendations with our order as well as our preferences. We had a baby with us and they accommodated us really well we tried the brussels sprouts, the carrots and the kale salad, the Apple and gruyère toast ( which the baby loved) and we got the pork Ragu, the octopus, and the cacio y pépé. we also tried the roasted pear for dessert. One of my friends had wine which he enjoyed and I got the cocktails which I definitely recommend. The food was completely amazing. All the ingredients were well thought out, very fresh and flavorful, thoughtfully combined and presented. I would probably recommend trying everything on the menu honestly I don't think you could go wrong. Some dishes are simpler with fewer ingredients but everything tastes absolutely delicious with complex flavors no matter what dish it is.",0
"Stopped in for a late lunch with a view and was seated fairly quickly. The view from the rooftop was beautiful and the decor inside and outside of the building was on point. We ordered chips and dip, a quesadilla, and a cobb salad.  The food was decent, but nothing extraordinary compared to other meals I've had in the city at similar price points. This is definitely a place you primarily come to for the experience of enjoying a day in Bryant Park.The service wasn't the best. After we were seated, it took quite a while for anyone to serve us despite the rooftop being almost empty.  Our water wasn't refilled and the server didn't check in until we flagged him down. That being said, when we were being tended to, the staff was kind and welcoming. All things considered, it was a bit overpriced for the experience, but to each their own.",0
"The food was amazing, I really couldn't fault it. The only thing I didn't like was that I felt like I was constantly sharing my food, which wasn't really a problem because everything was so delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!",1
"I visited Rib No 7 for the first time today and I have to say that it was a pretty disappointing experience. The food was decent, but I thought the meat quality was a bit on the lower end and it didn't compare well to the quality I've experienced at Yoon Haeundae Galbi. The service was also pretty slow and I didn't feel very welcome. Overall, I think there are better options in NYC if you're looking for a more upscale dining experience.",1
This review is not for the food cause I never actually got to eat.  Came here on holiday Monday after Juneteenth.  It took 20 minutes to be seated. Then once we were seated no one ever came to take our order for another 20 minutes! I was starving so had to leave because it seemed hopeless. It turns out they only have one waiter for about 15 tables which is poor planning. Most other tables were also struggling to get their order taken or pay for the bill. I likely won't be coming back.,0
Nice decent slices! Looked pretty clean. Toppings for the slices were in good variety at around 11:30pm on a Wednesday.I ordered a pepperoni and olive slice which was $4. Although for being a restaurant I was sad to be turned away from being allowed to use the bathroom as a paying customer (came in with someone else who also bought a slice). Not sure what kind of sit down food establishment doesn't offer a restroom.  Staff was friendly but just kind of stupid bathroom rule. But come here anyway- pizza was good :-),0
"We came here for lunch and had the lunch specials. The lunch special dishes were decent... a little on the westernized side, and flavors were okay, but not good enough to warrant another visit (for me at least). We ordered 3 lunch specials. Each was meant to come with a soup or drink. However they only gave us 2 soups (probably because there were 2 of us). I think they should have least asked us if we wanted a 3rd soup or a drink since it was included, but they did not. Food came out fairly fast. We ordered:-spicy beef with greens. This wasn't very spicy. Flavor was okay though... probably my favorite of the 3. Portion size was fine-eggplant was too heavy on the sauce, but again the portion size was good-""jumbo"" shrimp. My friend asked for a recommendation and the waitress suggested this (no surprises there as this was the most expensive lunch special). Shrimp were hardly jumbo, and I given the quantity I was underwhelmed by this. I did glance at the regular menu. Dishes seemed to be in the mid $20s/$30s or higher.",0
This place was pretty popular on a friday night. We made a reservation but it was a 30 min wait for a table inside or a table outside was ready right away. Only the tables outside near the door have heaters above them. I got a mojito which was pretty good and a decent size. Ive heard the food is good too but i only got drinks here. There's only one bathroom so the line does get pretty long when it's busy,0
"Franchia is a great vegan restaurant that is worth a stop on the NYC vegan eating trail. Their prices are still not exactly cheap, as $20 seems a little high for a plate of vegetables and rice, but the food is really outstanding. My favorite dish so far has been the braised tofu with kabocha and eggplant: really well-seasoned veggies and tofu. The bibimbap is delicious, especially in the hot stone bowl. The spicy Korean chili tofu is really tasty: crisp tofu cubes in a savory garlicky sauce. The spicy Franchia noodles are good. The pumpkin noodle salad is great (light and refreshing). The shiitake mushroom ""bulgogi"" was good but not amazing. They also have a selection of vegan sushi; the only one I've tried is the spicy tuna roll which was good but did not hold a candle to the sushi at Planta Queen. Their desserts and drinks do not impress as much as their actual food. The tiramisu came in a ridiculously tiny portion and was topped with stale rice crispies. The soy cheesecake was decent. The mindfulness cocktail (makgeolli with orange) and the reincarnation cocktail (soju with Asian pear) were",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The decor is really beautiful, and the service was excellent. I especially loved the outdoor seating. The ceviche was my favorite dish, and the fish was really fresh. The scallop ceviche was also good. The only downside was that the entrees were a bit on the heavy side. But overall, I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant.",1
"This place is great for cheap eats! I got a 2 cheese slice and it was really good. It was thin crust and had a good flavor. They also had hot sauce, parm, and pepper flakes which made it even better. It was a small spot, but they had plenty of seating.",1
"It was standard pho for me, nothing too great or terrible. The broth was solid, I wish the meat was less thick and that their special also includes beef balls. They don't give much basil or bean sprouts though. However, cheap bowl that'll get you full and satisfied !",0
"L'ADRESSE is an intimate and cozy restaurant with a beautiful view of Bryant Park. I came here for dinner with 3 friends on a Friday night and luckily there were a few tables available. For appetizer, we shared the mushroom flat bread (5/5). I had the pesto gnocchi with Brussel sprouts and it was delicious. The portion sizes are not to big and not too small, just the right amount of food. My friend got the bouillabaisse (a French fish stew or soup I believe) and she loved it. For dessert we shared the creme brûlée, and the waiter brought our a complimentary mousse cake since it was my friends birthday!Everything was perfect from the food to the service. It is pricey but the food is actually worth it, unlike some other places. Would definitely recommend.",0
"Had a great time at bar Stanley. Went to Zodiac upstairs for lunch with friends, the. Stopped at Bar Stanley to check it out. It's in the men's section of Neiman Markus, and other than an incorrectly set up foose ball table in front of the bar area ( drove Mark and I crazy because we couldn't figure out what felt wrong until we realized the the defenders were set up on the wrong ends ‍‍‍) it was a great experience.Servers were knowledgeable and helpful, and the cocktails were very very well done. Negroni was great, loved the espresso martini, and I had a bourbon during that was poured from a bottle filled with smoke. Very cool presentation. The view from this location was excellent too!",0
"This restaurant had high expectations from me, but it fell short. The brunch I had was okay, but the highlight was the salad and miso soup. The rice was also served barely warm and it was very loud inside. The music was nice, but it clashed with my food. I would like to come back and try out some of their menu items.",1
"I keep trying to leave my detailed review but it won't let me post it. Check out the review on google for details. It saddens me to write this review because the location in Cambridge MA got a 5 stars from me, not this location. This locations service and final product served was not to Amorino standards IMO.I'm just gonna point out the details for now:- they didn't have whipped cream for ""the must"" that's built around it.- they didn't have ""gourmet cup"" cups And failed at making it on a different cup (didn't put the crunchies in between both gelato scoops with the syrup, put crunchies on top (which was all falling ) and didn't add syrup at all.- didn't have covers for the cups to carry to go.me. See picture for full review",0
"I recently visited this restaurant and was impressed. The food was great and the prices were reasonable. I was able to eat for two for only twenty bucks. I really love the fact that they've gotten on to e-commerce and are constantly updating their menu. The presentation of the food has been looking better too, which is great. Highly recommend this spot!",1
"It's sad seeing Mercado Little Spain so empty due to Covid-19 safety protocols. 

We brought a lot of family and friends here in 2019 and early 2020 to sit at the bar, sip sangria and pop deconstructed molecular gastronomy olives or dine at Mar (miss their eggy white asparagus dish) or savor fresh out of the fryer warm churros dipped in rich chocolate. 

But we've since been back twice seated inside the quiet mercado in October 2020 and March 2021, now positioned like a restaurant instead of a food hall and we still love this place. 

Imagine being at Platea Madrid or the Mercado San Miguel, this place by celebrity chef Jose Andres transports you effortlessly to Spain. 

The mussels in tomato sauce are the tastiest and plumpest in the city. 

The garlic butter shrimp is still sizzling when it's brought to the table. 

My husband practically licks the plate of octopus on creamy potato. 

I can't wait to see Mercado Little Spain when all of the different food sections reopen and it's bustling with diners, but for now, the food is still",1
"Service: 2.5/5Food: 4.5/5Ambiance: cozy vibes for winter, pretty quietFirst impressions, it looks like a small shop, but there's a decent amount of seating space, and I love the decor. My impression was that it's a family-owned shop, so service is slow, but they're nice about it. They messed up my original order, and I don't know if it was confusion or a miscommunication, but they forgot to remake my order. Eventually, it did come out. Prices aren't bad, but it's maybe a smaller portion than what you're used to. Other tips- seat yourself, order at the table, clean up after yourself, and pay at the counter when finished.What I Ordered:Beef Bibimbap- cold version came out a little warm with a perfectly fried egg and tender beef. Beef Ramyun- what they gave me by mistake. It came with shredded carrots and again tender beef.Sliced Rice Cake Ramyun- perfectly chewy, and the pork-based (?) broth gave me optimal comfort levels, esp on a cold day.",0
"Mama's Cupboard is a restaurant I always love going to. They always have delicious food, and their kimchi fries are my favorite thing on the menu. Their pork Banh mi is also really good, and their lemongrass rice bowl is also a great option. They never disappoint, and I always enjoy my time there.",1
"The people at Sojourn were attentive and accommodating. The were always available if we needed anything and made sure everything was perfection when it arrived at our table. I had a 3 course meal that included duck spring rolls, salmon and chocolate cake. I loved every portion of my meal but I will break it down. The duck spring rolls were bomb. They had a crispy outside and the plum sauce that came with them was both sweet and spicy, which was perfect. The salmon had crispy skin but was tender . The star of the entree, however, was really the mushrooms. The salmon is on a bed of mushrooms and they are delicious. The flourless chocolate cake was full of flavor! Between the Nutella, the caramel sauce, bourbon, and ice cream... it was delicious.The cake it self was chocolatey and delicious! It was a wonderfully done meal",0
Cute spot with good food. They make their own pasta and you can tell that it's very fresh and the texture was just right. The octopus however was a bit on the chewy side. The service was very fast and attentive.,0
"Maison Kayser is packed on weekdays and empty on weekends. You can sit in the back where there's a bunch of tables and it's super cute and bright, or you can grab pastries and coffee in the front. I admittedly love sitting and having their coffee, especially because there's free refills and almond milk available. I'm a fan of their chia seed and raspberry cups as a healthy snack. I've also had their scrambled eggs and smoked salmon brunch dish, and it's pretty tasty and filling. I love how the eggs aren't greasy or buttery, like how they sometimes are elsewhere. However, the portion is very small for the price, but it's a French cafe in midtown, so there's that. The service is on point - they take their duties here seriously. I do enjoy visiting and dining at MK. I just wish prices were a bit lower or portions were a bit bigger.",0
"The beet soup was good, but could have used a little more lemon juice/citrus for flavor. The dumplings were pretty good, and the pancakes weren't sweet, but they gave us a jam to have it with. The ricotta cheese pancakes were good, but we expected condensed milk as is shown in all the pictures online.",1
"The all-day breakfast and lunch spot in SoHo is decent. The salad with salmon was good and well cooked, and the beet dip was oddly sweet. The kids enjoyed the waffles and sandwiches. However, I didn't enjoy the place as much. The seating in the back was quite uncomfortable, and the ambience was a little bland.",1
"Overall, I enjoyed my recent meal at this restaurant. The omakase was a great way to experience a variety of food, and the prices were reasonable. However, I feel that the prices have increased since my last visit, and some of the dishes were not as good as others. The scallop is still one of my favorite items, though.",1
"A friend recommended coming here for lunch...it was great recommendation and location was easy to get to. Small inside so no seating but can get take out and sit outside or just take it to go. Friendly staff and services. Variety in the menu to choose from. Options to create your own poke or select from their menu. Choose your base - rice/noodles, salad or burrito, then proteins, sauce, mix-ins and toppings.. There is also sushi option if you please.... Easy peasy. I had the sushi rice with chicken and shrimp with ponzu sauce and toppings...it was delicious. There's a Yelp check-in coupon for free soda for one time use. Prices are reasonable. Definitely will come again and try something different perhaps.",0
I was unimpressed with this restaurant. The servers at the counter were not very attentive and the food was average. The salad I ordered was sparse and the chicken on my salad was not very good. The pizza I later ordered was also average. I would not recommend this restaurant.,1
"Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that we didn't get to enjoy our booth as much as we would've liked.",1
"came on a Saturday around 12:30 and had to wait about 20 minutes for 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was super pleasant! I ordered the chicken chilaquiles from the brunch menu. Overall great flavor but not a huge fan of how it was played. The ""fried tortillas"" (aka chips) laid under the chicken which was mixed w salsa made the chips super soggy. Could have put it to the side or maybe served it faster, or maybe left the salsa on the side? Flavor overall was ok and speed of service was good for the busy brunch rush.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The soup was hot and sour and the har gao was delicious. The Loh Bak Go was also great, and the Gung Hay Fat Toy was a nice treat. The only downside was that the meatless mao po tofu was a bit bland. All in all, though, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Prince Street Pizza is a great spot for pizza in Detroit. The restaurant is small, but the pizza is delicious. The Perfection pizza is especially good, and it tastes even better when it's cold. The wait can be a bit long, but it's worth it.",1
"Oceana's outdoor pop up beer garden, West Park, is a great place to enjoy a refreshing drink on a summer evening. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the beer is delicious. The only downside is that there is no server service, so you have to order drinks and snacks at the stand. The live music was enjoyable, and the picnic tables provided a comfortable place to sit.",1
I love a good pad thai but OBAO's pad thai was extremely vinegary that it was slightly hard to eat in my opinion. The vermicelli bun was pretty good and a decent portion and had a good amount of pork/shrimp. The silverware being dirty and something being in my water cup also dampened the experience :(,0
"Came to Westville last night after work, around 530pm. I placed an order through Grubhub for pick-up: a family meal for 4. You have the option of selecting 4 proteins and 4 vegetables, and it comes with a side of rice, and a free order of mac and cheese. I opted for the grilled chicken, chicken cutlet, salmon (+$2), broccoli, brussel sprouts, cauliflower and mushrooms. I love coming to Westville when I want to eat healthy because they have so many vegetable options and their portions are always perfect. I recommend their market plate to veggie lovers. I've also been to two of their other locations: Westville East and Westville Hudson. The quality of the food never disappoints. Highly recommend this location anyone who works in the financial district.",0
"I enjoyed my meal at Thai Jasmine Restaurant. The curry dishes are just the right level of spice for me, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The service is efficient and friendly, and the place is not terribly busy - this is probably due to the fact that it gets the crowd from the nearby government buildings during the week. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good value and a relaxing atmosphere.",1
"My bf and I walked by this place and decided to walk in for dinner because of the nice ambience. We were seated outdoors with the pretty lights and greenery. The dinner menu didn't have too many choices which was a good thing since I can be indecisive. We decided to share food since we were going for some pizza around the corner after. Burrata (4/5): Haven't had an appetizer like this before. The burrata was warm and gooey with a leek/chive olive oil drizzle surrounding it. There were pieces of toast on the side to eat it with. It was too hard/toasty for me to bite into, but overall was enjoyable altogether. Swordfish (4/5): I should have know this dish would be small. Definitely not enough to share if you plan to only have dinner here, but in our case we had other plans afterward. The fish was tasty! Each bite was smooth with hints of oregano (?). Cucumber Cooler (5/5): This was quite a refreshing cocktail. Cucumber flavor was definitely there with little to more like no alcohol flavor, which is what I prefer. Definitely recommend!It was a busy night, but our server was attentive. Food is pricey so come ready to enjoy.",0
"Llama San is a wonderful Japanese Peruvian fusion restaurant that exceeded my expectations! With all the changes that COVID has brought about it's hard for any restaurant to recreate their signature atmosphere and experience but Llama San goes above and beyond to deliver! Overall the experience was wonderful even outdoors right by the street and the was food unparalleled experience. Seating: Due to COVID everyone has their temperature checked and is seated outside. They have done a wonderful job with heavy plants and flowers to help separate you from the street - we were entirely surrounded and secluded.



Food: So their menu is a bit limited at the moment but they have about 9 tapas items on the menu - there are 2-3 veg options. I HIGHLY recommend the ceviche. We had both the octopus/calamari one and tuna. Both were wonderful but the octopus calamari won in my books. There was also a duck dish that was phenomenal along with the pork tonkatsu. For vegetarians, there is an eggplant dish as well as a beans based one. Drinks: I had two rounds of the Veintiuno because it was that delicious. The flavors just kept coming at you even after you took your sip",1
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is lively and charming, and the food was outstanding. The portions are quite large, so it's perfect for tapas fans. I particularly loved the spinach dish with raisins - it was so delicious. The roasted corn with manchego cheese was also a huge hit with me, and the anchovies with home made potato chips were an excellent finale. All in all, I highly recommend this place for a fun and delicious meal.",1
"I think the Ichiran dining experience is one of the most unique ways to serve up ramen. I really enjoyed the stall and individual dining to allow for more of a focus on the food itself. In my opinion, the broth was flavorful but I wish it were a little more rich. I went with all the recommended options on the menu as a baseline, but I'll probably get more rich and stronger dashi (saltiness) in the future. The noodles were a great texture, firm but chewy, and paired well with the broth. I also enjoyed the chashu which was very tender.Overall, I think this place is a little expensive for what you get but it definitely is a high-quality meal.",0
"I've been craving falafel and Nish Nush came through! They have a Falafel Trio Platter that comes with three different types of falafel (classic, roasted pepper, and spinach and mushroom). My favorite was the roasted pepper because it had a bit of a kick to it compared to the classic falafel and it was a bit more firm in texture than the spinach and mushroom falafel.What I really liked about the platter was the different types of salad that came with it. You literally get to try a little bit of everything! Oh, and I love that you have a choice between white or whole wheat pita! Yay for the health conscious! It also doesn't hurt that they give you a generous amount of hummus to dip your falafel and pita bread in.",0
I really enjoy this restaurant for take out. The pho broth is really good and it's kept me cozy and full during the cold Covid winter months. They do give sriracha if you ask for it.,1
"I love Sophie's Cuban Restaurant! The garlic shrimp with yellow rice and beans and maduros is my favorite meal! I also love the green sauce and their empanadas. I do wish they would give more maduros or tostones when you select that as a side (currently you get 3). The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommend Sophie's to anyone looking for a quick and delicious Cuban meal!",1
"I came to this restaurant with a group of friends for brunch and we all really enjoyed our meal. The food was great and all of the brunch drink options were very sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised that the best menu item we got was the quinoa bowl. It was a great change of pace from the other dishes on the menu.",1
"Terra Thai is a great little Thai restaurant in the heart of Alphabet City. The food is familiar and delicious, and the iced tea is fantastic - sweet and refreshing, perfect for the summer heat. The staff is friendly and efficient, and the restaurant does takeout and delivery. It's a great casual spot for a quick bite or a caffeine hit - definitely worth a visit!",1
They must be going through growing pains but I sat at the counter for lunch around 12:50 and it was a zoo. People were waiting on pickup orders for 1-1.5 hours and many people cancelled. My food took 30 minutes to come out.I ordered the salt and pepper pork chops with rice. It was a big portion but didn't stand out in any specific way. The rice I got was dry and hard too.I also ordered a salted fish and chicken fried rice for takeout. It is also a nice portion and smells nice but has very little chicken or salted fish. Don't really taste it until you hit a big chunk.The place itself is slightly nicer and more western in feel than other places but it doesn't really justify the long wait times.Might raise score if they get their act together,0
"The original chef left for four seasons and I can find very little information out there about the new chef Andy Keith. After a meal here it's quite clear that this guy knows how to cook. Monkfish was cooked exactly right and the texture of mostly everything is perfect. At the same time he is really pushing the boundaries in terms of flavors. Everything is spicy and the flavors are heavy to the point of being overwhelming and confusing, especially for seafood. There are other missteps. One of the four gulf shrimps I got was missing its head so the kitchen hid it right underneath the other three. The black kale is fried with stem on and the stem tastes like twig upon chewing. And definitely steer away from the uni toast... both desserts (chocolate pudding and olive oil cake) had great flavors but the temperature and texture are just slightly off. The drink menu is good as always but I was served the wrong drink (got GLOW but received Heima) and also I miss the chenin blancs. My biggest complaint is during restaurant week the restaurant is completely incapable of handling crowds and rushes. I was seated half hour past my reservation time and many tables in the restaurant were waiting short of an hour between courses. The staff is very well trained so I assume everything would have been fine if they simply didn't overbook. Overall disappointing.",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch today and was really impressed! The menu is large and includes a lot of classic Italian dishes, all of which are done well. The service was quick and the prices were reasonable. Overall, a great choice for a casual lunch.",1
"I went to Fine Asian Cuisine for dinner and was impressed. The sauce is what makes this restaurant stand out, and it was really good. The slices were a bit small for my taste, but overall it was a good experience. The restaurant is located in a convenient location, and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend to come grab a drink and was not disappointed. Upon walking in we were greeted by a friendly bartender and sat by the bar area. They do have tables throughout the bar if you don't want to sit at the actual bar. This is a cute sports bar. All the tables had candles lit on them and the lighting was perfectly dim. The aesthetic of the bar was very laid-back and chill. They have big screen TVs throughout the place so you won't miss a thing. They have a well stocked bar area. I mean,cmon, they have frozen rose! What more can you want?! Overall, if you're looking for a laid-back casual sports bar then this is your spot!",0
"What a great experience!  Things to know: 1. They will only accept up to 2 credit cards per table. Not a huge deal. Just know it. 2. This is a massive dining room, so it doesn't feel intimate. The atmosphere really unique, and the food is quite delightful, and authentic.  There was nothing you could leave wanting for, save something extremely uncommon. We tried a wide variety of items at our table, except beef, and chicken feet. 

The soups were delightful. The tea was fresh and perfectly steeped. The dumplings were all cooked just right, not overdone and not too dry or too wet. I very much enjoyed the bacon-wrapped shrimp balls, which seems a very American item for Dim Sum, but really good nevertheless. Definitely consider adding this to your NYC experience.",1
"Flor de Mayo is always on our must go list each time we come to NY. The lomo saltado, broiled pork chops and rotisserie chicken are very juicy and delicious. The plantains are also quite good though I think the Cuban places make them better.Considering how popular this place is, I am surprised that we have never had to wait for more than 5 minutes to get seated. It is a little cramped inside so I do not recommend bringing a stroller when you have babies with you. The waiters and the owner himself are all friendly and very welcoming, especially towards regular customers. On our most recent visit, the warmth with which they accorded my Manhattanite brother and to us visitors was enough to comfort our shivering Angeleno bodies not used to the cold.",0
"The pork potstickers were great, and the price was unbeatable. However, the Lo Mein was pretty peppery for my taste, and I wasn't too thrilled with it.",1
"I had a pretty bad experience at Chloe this past weekend. I've ordered food from them twice online, and both times, while they included everything in my order, I asked for them to include a side of the chipotle aioli in my bag and they didn't do it. They also did not include any utensils either time. I ordered the mac and cheese for a third time on Monday, and it just tasted completely off. Something about the sauce this time was almost chemical-y, and it just didn't taste right in comparison to the two times I had it before. It also left a really odd mouth feel.

I've had their mac and cheese, their juices, the chia seed pudding, a push pop, and a rainbow cookie from there - along with other things. The juices are good, as was the chia seed pudding. The push pop was almost completely melted by the time it got to me and it was just too sweet for me. My biggest complaint with by Chloe is that they couldn't follow the simple directions on my order and they didn't include utensils. I had to then go hunting for them in my office. There was also then no way to call them to tell them these issues,",1
This is now one of my favorite restaurants after today. Everything we ordered was mouthwatering.  My grain salad was unbelievable and perfect for the high temperature we were having in NY. I asked for a pouched egg on top. Perfect addition. I never knew that a parsley salad could taste so refreshing. My daughter had the spinach and feta entree that looked like a high end version of a quesadilla as it was made with phyllo. I don't know anyone who doesn't love phyllo - phyllo makes any dish luxurious. The flavor of browned butter was incredible. She added a side of turkey bacon to her dish. It was nice to see the restaurant offer turkey bacon instead of pig bacon.  I highly recommend the baklava dessert. It was worth the $16. Every penny. And don't forget their turkey coffee with their complimentary little soft cookie.  Coming back!!,0
"I visited Greek Islands Grill on a weekday evening, and was seated right away without a reservation. The mixed grill, which is their specialty, was very large and consisted of chicken souvlaki, chicken gyro, pork gyro, and kefta skewers. The meats were delicious and the dipping sauces were fantastic. The portions were so large that the two of us were very full afterwards. The service was great, and the staff was attentive and kind. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for Greek food in the Upper East Side.",1
"Stopped by here for a late lunch with some friends while we were in FiDi/Chinatown. We went in and were told to pick anywhere to sit - they have booths outside of the restaurant itself.We then waited for quite a while before someone came by to serve us water and take our orders. We were surprised it took so long, given there weren't many customers at the time. (We went in at 3pm on a Saturday) The person taking our order didn't seem to understand our English too well so it took a while for them to take our order and we had to correct them several times.Our food finally came but it wasn't clear what anything was because the takeout containers we got our food in were not labeled. We just had to open the containers and figure it out ourselves. My friend also ordered dumplings and got noodles instead and had to go back inside the restaurant to tell them. They agreed to fix the order but she didn't get her dumplings (appetizer) until we were done with our entrees.I ordered the pan fried noodles with fried tofu. The portion size was generous, pretty standard for an Asian restaurant and for $10 in NYC, it's a great deal. I do wish they had more veggie in the noodles and I wish they were a little softer (more cooked) because they were more on the al dente side. I also wish the noodles/sauce was more flavorful as I had to add a packet of the Lee Kum chili sauce in order to make the noodles tastier.Overall, the noodles were pretty good and at a great price but the customer service was slow and the fact that the place is cash only isn't ideal.",0
"after a long night of bar hopping, my friends and i were FAMISHED and ready to eat just about anythingwhile walking down the street, we came across a pizza place and headed inside instantly! first off, it was so appreciated that the store was heated, protecting us from the cold weather outsidewe were instantly greeted with aromas of fresh pizza and a friendly worker asking if we knew what we wanted to order. the store is small in size, but there were two indoor table we could sit at and a booth area to consume your pizza before exiting.-- -- --pictured:"" the sophia loren ($4.25) // this felt like a rendition of the classic margherita pizza and boyyy it was so goodthe tomatoes were tender, matching perfectly with the fresh basiland mozzarella. while the toppings were great, the crispy crust really stole the show!-- -- --would definitely come back for a slice of pizza:)",0
"This restaurant was closed when we went, but we'll definitely be trying it some other time and see if it's open. Based on the notes, it seems like it would be a great place to try Thai cuisine.",1
"I am finally reviewing Uva. This was the first place that I can for true Italian food on the UES. There is no reason treking to Little Italy (I would tell my parents). It's great for brunch and I recommend the vegetarian antipasto to share. It comes with a ton of marinated vegetables and creamy burrata. It goes well with the bread on the table served with their smoky olive oil. Their omelets are incredible and their calamari is so crispy. For dinner, I recommend their truffle gnocchi. It's so light and fluffy for a dish that can be heavy traditionally. An honorable mention is the rigatoni alla siciliana with eggplant and their eggplant Parmesan.  I can go on and on there are honestly no bad options. I'm so happy they're doing well with tons of outdoor seating now.",0
"Had dinner at Rafele with some girlfriends a few weeks ago, and definitely recommend it if you're looking for a cute Italian spot in the West Village!The food was delicious - we shared buratta as an app, and then got the Spaghetti Frutti de Mare, Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe, Orecchette Friarielli (sausage and broccoli rabe), and the Pizza Rafele. Portions were just right, just enough so were full but still had room to split a tiramisu and chocolate cake! Nothing jumped out on the wine list, but we had a decent bottle of Valpolicella.It was was surprisingly crowded for a Wednesday night, but we had a reservation so there was no wait for a table. Their outdoor parklette is covered, enclosed and has heaters so hopefully they're able to offer ""outdoor"" seating all year long.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant while in the area and had mixed feelings about my experience. First time eating ramen in person in a while and was excited to try it. I asked for a vaccine card in the beginning and was seated in the corner of the 1 person seating facing the kitchen. I checked in via the Yelp app and selected the free matcha pudding with red bean as my combo order.

My ramen came before my bao bun and then I had to chase them down for my free item. Overall, the flavor of the pork bao bun was just ok, not cooked crispy like I've had it in other places. The pork belly was just ok, not cooked crispy. The sauce was super watered down. The ramen broth was just ok, not as spicy as I expected. The matcha pudding was bland. I added the half and half cream on top and mixed it in, but it had better flavor. You can tell this is a high volume business but for a ramen specialty place, all quality should be in the broth. This was a miss for me and hence, I give it 3 stars.",1
"Came here for brunch with a few friends. The space pretty small - so I would recommend calling for a reservation before coming just in case. We used a fever promotion to come for brunch which ended up making a 90 minute boozy brunch $28 including food! Great deal. However, using the promotion was a bit of a hassle and the restaurant was having issues. When we got our menus though, we realized that the promotion was the regular deal so it is better to just not buy the promotion and just come straight to the restaurant. There is a surcharge for any seafood brunch item so stick to your land meats. The service was friendly, but a bit weird. You can get margs, mimosas or bloody marys for brunch. We got some margs which were good, but a bit sweet. We switched to mimosas, but every time we asked for another round, we needed to provide our glasses cause they ran out of champagne glasses. Weird... but OK. They flip flopped from constantly being at our table to make sure that everything was OK to going missing for a bit of time. The food itself was mediocre, nothing to call home about, but kept us from getting too drunk so that was good. Overall, a good experience and you can't beat that price. Looks like they have an awesome happy hour deal so might come back to check that out one day!",0
"I'm so glad there's a Sophie's in Murray Hill!! I checked it out last week. The service is super fast, everyone is really friendly, and you always get huge portions. I love to drop in for a quick pick-me-up, which is usually a chicken empanada or two for me. And as any Sophie's aficionado knows, the green sauce is amazing. Definitely recommend checking this spot out for your fast Cuban fix. For anyone who misses Sophie's in their weekly midtown lunch rotation, this is a great option for everyone working from home during Covid.",0
"I visited this restaurant with a group of 9 girlfriends for my cousin's birthday. The price fix menu was $145 per person, and we were all very pleased with our selections. I especially enjoyed the Rock Shrimp Tempura appetizer, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, the Decent Veggie Spring Rolls, and the Pac Man Seafood Dumplings. The Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings were not a hit with the group, but the Dry Aged Porterhouse and the Peking Duck were both very good. The only downside was that the sides were a bit too much rice for our liking, and the Lobster, Crab, and Chicken all tasted the same. The Bok choy was good, and the Broccoli in garlic sauce was a nice addition to our meal. The Red Velvet cake was okay, but the Peanut Butter Cheese cake was not to my taste. The Apple crumb cheese cake was my favorite dessert. The restaurant was very nicely decorated, and the service was good. The price was high, but it was worth it for the food and drinks we enjoyed.",1
"Went here for reservations for NYE and it was good! The Chelsea burger was delicious. Soft bun, arugula, bacon jam and a juicy not overdone patty with caramelized onions really hit the spot. The fries were also identical to Mcdonald's! My friends liked their fried chicken tacos and the 3 slider appetizer was really similar in sizing to an In and out / Mcdonald's burger but obviously better quality. The espresso martinis weren't very strong in coffee flavor or thick mouthfeel like one with real espresso but was still good. The service is where I dock points. The hostess was a bit rude when I called and asked if the Semifinals football game would be playing and they kicked us out promptly at 8 even though our reservation was until 8:30 because they were closing for an hour. Felt very rushed. She also included the tip and didn't bring me back the final receipt which was a 10$ difference (perhaps a card % fee?). Either way I would've wanted a printed receipt. I don't know if I'll come back but it's a good option for better / a bit more upscale food and cozier seating for a sports ish bar.",0
Food: 3.5/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Overall:  Super cute ambiance with standard food.The extended review...Food:Gyoza - 3/5 - This was a fried version and the taste was standard fare.Galbi-Jim - 3.5/5 - The dish itself was fairly tasty but I think the portion size was a little small.  The meat was very tender but not as plentiful.Mackerel - 3.5/5 - A simple grilled piece of fish that was decent in taste.Service: 4/5 - The staff was very attentive and friendly.Ambiance: 4/5 - A super cute place.   The décor was very nice on the interior and there was some seating on the exterior as well.,0
"I had a great time at Restaurant Week at this place! The decor is really cute and the waiters were super nice. I got the 2 course option and my appetizer was the pork meatballs. They were really good, crispy on the outside and really flavorful and soft on the inside. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce they came with, but that's just a personal preference. My entree was the butter squash ravioli and they were really good too. They were so light and buttery and I'd definitely get them again. I also came here with some coworkers and we all had a great time. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a fun lunch break.",1
"I came with a date, who made a reservation, so we were seated right away. The outdoor setup was pretty nice and the tables were all evenly spread out. They had a few fans placed around the tables to help with the summer heat and the staff was friendly. We ordered the calamari, pappardelle bolognese, and braised short rib. The calamari came with fried zucchini and was a good appetizer to share. It was lightly breaded and wasn't too greasy. The pappardelle pasta was good but the bolognese sauce was a bit bland. I would try another one of their pasta dishes instead. My date really enjoyed his braised short rib and cleaned his plate. The portion was big and the dish came with mashed potatoes. Highly recommend if you're looking for comfort food or a hearty meal!",0
"Charm is my favorite Thai takeout spot in the Harlem/upper west side area! Their lunch special is only $8.50 for an entree and appetizer, and I got the red curry spicy and chicken tom yum soup. The chicken red curry is my absolute favorite and the lunch special is such a great deal. My roommate got the drunken noodles lunch special and loved it. I love that Charms red curry is so flavorful and they put slot of chicken in so you totally get your money's worth. For $8.50 I had lunch yesterday and have leftovers to eat today so I don't have to go out during our nyc snowstorm. Service is also incredibly kind, I went in person for the first time yesterday and realized now that this is a take out strictly joint, there is NO seating. The woman at the register so kindly gave me hand sanitizer from her own bag when I asked if they had any. Love this place, its now my go-to.",1
"I like Douska. The hand rolls are good and the prices are reasonable, especially when you go for any of their combos.",0
"Went there for a birthday dinner. Overall experience was good. Decor was very elegant. Atmosphere was very quiet in the beginning and then turned louder when more ppl coming in. Food was good, especially their signature beef courses, except for the beef sushi I am not a huge fan. Dessert the green tea tiramisu was yummy. Only downside for the whole experience was service being very slow, because they obviously were short in staff. The whole dining room with around 10 tables there were only 2 servers and 1 bartender. The waiter that was serving us also responsible for at least 4 more tables with greeting ppl, serving food, getting the pot for sukiyaki ready, explaining food, preparing checks, etc. He was very committed but super busy - he almost ran back and forth. He did a great job though the management should consider adding more staff. Our whole dinner took almost 2.5 hours vs the expected 1.5 hours.",0
"A perfect afternoon treat after a bit of walking. I ordered the bone marrow bruschetta and it did not disappoint. Neither did the Super Tuscan glass of wine. The bone marrow was of course rich, melty, and buttery. I also loved the gremolata and pickled red onion that lightened it up a bit on the crunchiest bread ever. So tasty! The service was attentive but not overly so...sometimes you just want to enjoy and be left alone, and it was perfect.",0
"I had a great time at China Blue! The atmosphere is really beautiful and the cocktails are really good. The food wasn't as great as I had hoped it would be, but I'm sure that there are plenty of other options if you're looking for something more substantial. The service was good, but they could have been more attentive when we first walked in. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot!",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The food was delicious, and the owner was super friendly. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for southeast Asian food. The prices are also very reasonable, especially for the east village.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, because the food is really good. However, I have to unfortunately echo the sentiments of the other reviewers. The service is awful. Servers are unfriendly and unhelpful, and service is SO slow. Even preCOVID, food and drinks took forever. Also the drinks are pretty bad. I don't know who the bartender/mixologist is but they need to revamp the recipes. I would honestly just order delivery for the food...but would hesitate to dine in again.",1
"Prince Street Pizza is always a long line, but it's definitely worth the wait! The sauce is different and tastes homemade, and the pizza is delicious. I also got a fanta because I was parched, and I'm definitely glad I did! As we were eating, people kept asking where we got it from, so I'm sure it's good enough for them too!",1
"Awful. I'd say their motto here is 'just get em to sit down, then it's fair game'. After hounding you like carnival barkers to get you to sit, they try to upsell you everything. Lousy and overpriced wine selection. The bread is just terrible with only butter packets as your option, no oil/herbs. The food was awful. Most inauthentic tomato sauce I have ever tasted. Ordered veal and they brought me chicken. They had a ton of lower-price ""specials"" but check your bill because I gave them my card before they brought the check and they charged us full-price.Dime-a-dozen conveyor belt Italian food here. Nonna is rolling in her grave so much she could power half of California.",0
"A lovely interior and backyard exterior made for a great dinner experience, with amazing food! The meat platter, mezze platter, and the egg and cheese pide is what I would highly recommend. I wasn't a fan at all of the desserts unfortunately.",0
"Moustache is a great place for lunch - the service is friendly and the food comes out quickly. The atmosphere is casual and perfect for a sunny day, and the price is right for the quantity of food you get. My favorite dish was the moussaka, but everyone in my group loved the chicken kabob. The pita bread was average, but it wasn't too strange that it wasn't complimentary. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Moustache - it's a great spot for a casual meal.",1
"Ordered the Stracciatella pizza from Motorino's upper west side location tonight. It was one of the best Neopolitan style pizzas I've ever had in NYC! The pizza dough was perfectly delicious, baked in a brick oven, full of flavor. The Stracciatella pizza was a welcome change from the usual tomato based pizza pies. Note- if you like those large runny sloppy super cheesy New York style pizzas, you might find this pizza underwhelming. But if you're into rich flavors and textures such as those found in the classic smaller sized Neopolitan style pizzas, then Motorino is THE place to go. The pizza I ordered wasn't large in size but it was enormous in flavor! Since I'm on a diet, every bite counts & it better be worth it.... and it was ! The rich buttery gourmet Italian cheese, fresh basil and sweet pear tomatoes blended together perfectly, literally melting in my mouth. So good! One pie wasn't enough. Will definitely order from Motorino again. About delivery pizza - Ordering online might be preferable -- it took 5 minutes of repeating my address to the very nice person taking orders over the phone. The pizza arrived promptly & still had to be reheated in the oven. But it was so delicious, I didn't mind & gave the delivery guy a nice tip ! Bottom line - if you're looking for a great Neopolitan style / brick oven pizza, this is the place!",0
"Braved the storm with a group of friends to try Asset during their first weekend of serving brunch. The ambiance and the set up of the restaurant is 5 stars! It feels like a downtown vibe on the UWS - which the area is seriously lacking. They did a great job decorating. I also like how the brunch cocktails are $10 but tasted like there was very little to no alcohol in it which is always a little disappointing. The brunch menu had a lot of good options - something for everyone. The food itself was very good. The staff and service was a little slow and we had to ask for more water 3 times before receiving it. The owner of the restaurant was also there sitting at the front but stared on his phone the whole time. I would have liked to see him walk around to the tables and ask the guests how they were liking their meal - or something to show they value feedback especially so early on in this restaurant's career! Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely be willing to go back to try it for dinner.",0
"I had a great time eating at TongKatsu! The chicken karage was my favorite dish, but I also really enjoyed the chicken breast katsu and pork tenderloin katsu. All of the menu items came with rice, slaw, and TongKatsu sauce, and I also got French fries with the curry sauce on the side. The only downside was that there weren't many other menu items available, but that's to be expected in a small restaurant like this. The host was really friendly and accommodated my dietary restrictions. I would definitely recommend TongKatsu to anyone looking for a good Japanese meal.",1
Got the Reel Deal here with my lovely wife! It's true what they say a happy wife means a happy life! And how couldn't she be delighted with the fresh haddock and 3 sides and red curry from Seamores! The fish was very fresh and seasoned perfectly! I would highly recommend the Reel deal to anyone coming here! P.S. the environment is very elegant and bright which is perfect for a spring/ summer date!,0
"P.S. is great! Our second time here, and we enjoyed everything. The selection was great, and the food was delicious. We got the brussel sprouts and the golden beet salad to start, he got the buffalo maitake sandwich, I got the Thai chicken sandwich, and he got the brownie and ice cream for dessert and I got the pumpkin mousse. It was all so good! We split the two burgers / sandwiches and we were so happily full and content, not overly stuffed. The first time we came, with my parents, there were buffalo maitake wings, sandwiches, burgers, golden beet salads, and possibly some desserts. P.S. is a big hit with everyone in the neighborhood, so speedy and efficient, and delicious food.",1
"I wasn't overly impressed with the food at this restaurant, but the service was great. I would recommend going here if you're looking for a place to catch up with old friends, but I'm not sure if I would go here regularly.",1
"I was really disappointed with my recent meal at this restaurant. The chicken and lamb bowl was tiny and the portions were sparse. The meat was also tough. The chicken tikka was also tough and the sauce was bland and watery. The prices are low but the delivery time is super fast, so it's indicative of the food not being freshly prepared to order. There are better Indian options in the area - and worth a higher price and longer delivery time.",1
"The food at this restaurant is decent, but the portions are a bit small for the price and quality is not super amazing to justify such small portions. The classic ceviche is fresh but it was a very small amount of fish with a large portion of Inca corn, which is not too sweet but makes a nice pairing with the ceviche. The chicken empanadas are good in itself, even better with the yellow and green sauces they provided (it wasn't spicy at all!) The lomo saltado is pretty good: the beef so tender and juicy, with flavorful onions and fries on the side. It's not too salty which is great compared to other lomo saltados I have tried in the past. The service is pretty good unlike what other reviews say. It's just a little hands off but we got what we needed in a timely manner.",1
"I stopped in at this restaurant for dinner and was really impressed. The pasta was excellent - very fresh and flavorful. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the chef came out to check on my meal after I finished. The downside is that if you take your meal to-go, it can be a bit clumpy after a while. Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking out this restaurant!",1
"I had ordered lunch takeout from here a couple times and delivery once and enjoyed it. Dinner was a chirashi bowl and while not amazing it was good enough.  Then this week, for the first time in a while, I ordered the chirashi bowl again for dinner delivery on Seamless and so did one of my coworkers.  The salmon was decent but the tuna had zero taste. This was my coworker's first time ordering and he was disappointed. One of our other coworkers passed by and asked if he liked it better than his usual place and he said no.",0
"Outdoor seating during pandemic: made plans to brunch here with a friend. They don't take reservations for their outdoor dining and recommended to get there after 2:30 or before 11am, as that tends to be their less busy periods. We were seated fairly quickly and I ordered the griddle special while my friend got Bubby's breakfast.The menu is on the extensive side and can seem a bit overwhelming but I wanted to try the pancakes so I was happy with my choice. The food came out really fast- about 5 minutes after the order was taken. I must admit that it seemed suspicious. My plate of food was cold. The pancakes weren't fresh and it wasnt fully cooked- I could still see the sticky batter in the pancake. I asked for my eggs over medium well and they came out over easy so I sent that back. Fresh eggs were brought 10 minutes later and very much still over easy. My friend sent his chocolate pancake back because he asked for no whipped cream and it came with whipped cream but at least he got it back hot. The waiter didn't seem to be paying attention in general so the service was a bit frustrating. The pancakes, though, I would give a 7/10 it would've just been better value for your money and food in general if it was served hot. If I were to come again I think I would send the entire meal back if it wasn't up to standard.",0
"Overall, I thought the Jian Bing at this location was pretty good. The service was typical food court fare, and the location was convenient and reasonably priced. The only downside was that the crepes can get a bit soggy if you eat them outside, but overall they're a decent option.",1
"I recently saw a Broadway show and my daughter and I walked into Pera for apps and drinks before taking the train back home. The bartender, who's name I didn't get, was tending bar, seating the walk-ins, and the whole package. We sat at the bar and ordered lavender Mojitos, and that was absolute perfection. Our apps...to die for...were grilled artichoke beautifully plated, with green pea puree, and we were so happy. Then the smoked eggplant with garlic yogurt served with pita chips, if I wasn't in a nice place I would've licked both plates. Our second drink was a mild jalapeño margarita, and our lovely bartender made and let us taste to wow us, AND IT WORKED. I could've easily sat there with my kid for another hour, it was so cozy and pretty inside. Pera is a mediterranean gem, you won't be sorry.",1
"I'm a big fan of this hotel. It's small but organized, the bed is firm and I always sleep well here. The front desk during the day is helpful, but at night it's less attentive. However, the price has dropped a lot recently, so it's definitely worth considering.",1
"I think this is my new favorite ramen spot! We ordered takeout from here and the ramen came hot and fresh. It can be challenging to find vegetarian ramen that is flavorful too, but this place hit the spot! They had two veggie ramens bowls on their menu. I ordered the spicy vegan curry and added garlic with spice level 2. I really didn't have to add anything extra to the ramen because it's great how it comes. The tofu that came in the ramen was good and it wasn't overly fried or oily. If you want more protein, I suggest adding more tofu because I think there were about 5 cubes. Each bite was so savory and delicious! The spiciness didn't kick in for me until the end when actually, when I felt my forehead start to break a sweat haha. It was worth it though. Next time I may get spice level 1 for this particular ramen because there's spice already added. The portion size was perfect too-not too much and not too little. I was able to finish the whole bowl. I had called the restaurant in advance because my husband wanted the spicy ginger stamina ramen but he didn't want pork. When I called the person who I spoke with was very friendly and said that they can substitute the pork with chicken, so it worked out! I'm looking forward to trying the other veggie ramen dish from here.",0
"I came here the other day with my coworkers! It was honestly okay, I was expecting more from the food. The drinks, they were all really good and refreshing! Super summery and sweet, perfect for a hot day. We ordered the mac & cheese which sounds so good on the menu and the fish tacos, some of my faves. The photos even make it look good but honestly i wanted more richness / flavor from the mac and cheese! There was something missing from it, maybe adding bacon will help next time? The fish tacos, i mean they were good but they're small as hell lol -- the fish was crispy and i liked the slaw a lot but they were wayyyy too over priced, especially for the portions. overall, it didn't blow me away. the happy hour prices are pretty average, nothing i'd consider a 'steal.' i would recommend this place if you're looking for a cute ambience for a drink and maybe an appetizer, but nothing crazy. service was ehhhh as well, nothing to really blow you away.",0
"I wasn't super impressed with my experience at this restaurant. The rice rolls were okay, but I wasn't really impressed with the filling. They were also a bit soggy for my taste. Overall, I didn't enjoy my time here.",1
"Wu's Wonton King is one of my favorite dim sum spots in Chinatown. The food is very well prepared, fresh and doesn't have too much oil. I come here quite often with my family. The dumplings are delicious and the roasted suckling pig is perfectly cooked and crispy! The staff can be a bit impatient but if you're looking for delicious/fresh food, this is the place to go. The restaurant is located right next to the F train so it's a convenient spot to visit. They also offer wonderful dinner options with fresh (still live before cooked) seafood.",0
"Calibrate your expectations accordingly and this can definitely be a 4-star experience.Those expectations: A mid-range uptown dim sum-focused restaurant paying exorbitant Chelsea rent while providing dishes New Yorkers are used to paying 2/3 of the price for in Chinatown. The portions are slightly smaller, the prices are somewhat higher, and the quality is just a hair different than Chi-town, Flushing or Sunset Park. I knew all that coming in and because of that, we had a great meal that felt like what I grew up eating. The standout item was the Steamed Rice with Spare Ribs. They do the brown glaze for these ribs (as opposed to the clear corn starch + black bean glaze more common in old-school Canto spots), and the combination of that sauce with white rice and bok choy that have absorbed the sauce's flavor is just delicious. The portion was smaller than I'm used to, but...I was prepared for that. Still worth getting.I loved that they offered the fancier style of custard buns with charcoal dough and edible gold brush. I was spoiled with this upscale version in my hometown of Toronto, but haven't seen many places offer it in NYC. Sadly, HY's version is much smaller (again), and the dough is too chewy, while the custard was too runny and grainy. Still, the general flavor was on point.If you're craving soup and need fiber, try the Tofu Soup with Bok Choy. Nothing fancy, just a savory clear broth and lots of greens. The very photogenic purple Steamed Veggie Dumplings are actually worth getting, loaded with mushrooms, bamboo, chives, water chestnuts, and a few other tasties. Finally, skip the tripe. It lacked the slivered celery and carrots I'm used to, and came out too dry and chewy without enough sauce (or ginger). Of note: Though it's billed as a dim sum restaurant, Hey Yuet actually has a substantive entree menu too. Skip it. The dim sum is what they do best. Also, the menu online isn't complete and there are many more options in person.",0
"Had a chance to head into the lower east side and felt a hankering for dim sum. My wife suggested XO taste since it had a plethora of dishes (including dim sum dishes). I ended up ordering beef brisket soup noodles, my wife had seafood congee, my daughter had a beef casserole dish and he boyfriend had General Tso chicken.  Those dishes complemented the assorted dim sum dishes which are 'made to order'. The Sieu Mei (pork dumplings) were filled to the gills and has two shrimp in them. Ima gunna go back!",0
"3.5 stars I came back specifically for those dumplings but maybe my taste buds changed .. the dumplings didn't taste as good as before... it wouldn't make sense that they changed the dumplings but who knows they were just ok. They weren't bad by any means but just not as great as I initially thought they were. I guess when there's twice as much... food doesn't taste as good. I got 10 dumplings vs 5 last time. $7 The Kim chi tots were again just okay. They weren't as salty as the first time, but I prefer my tots to be crispy and for me less is always better.. I prefer to eat tots without anything on them.",0
"Ordered the chicken tatsuta-age to start. The chicken was extremely juicy and fried well but I was not a big fan of the sauce, which seemed like a vinegar based, mild, chipotle mayo. The pieces were fairly large and a small was definately enough for 2. For mains, we ordered the spicy niku and curry with washuyu beef. We added a poached egg and shiitake mushroom to each, and also mochi to the curry udon. The noodles came in a massive bowl, and had a decent amount of toppings. I absolutely loved the spicy niku broth, which had a lot of flavor but didn't feel too heavy. My girlfriend liked the curry broth, though I felt it was a little watery. The short ribs were tender and the honeycomb tripe added a unique texture to the dish. Both eggs were perfectly poached. The shiitake was also delicious - it's marinated/preserved in some type of sweet soy sauce and has a very firm texture - but we were a bit surprised we only received one piece each. All in, I'd be happy to return and order the Spicy Niku again with the same add-ons.",0
"I visited Mamoun's Falafel for the first time in almost five years and it was just as I remembered it. The speed with which I guzzled it as I sat outside outdoors in the cold, relishing the hot fresh crisp on outside tender inside falafels was truly bliss. The am excelled herbed baba ganoush and rice to go with it along with hummus and their signature hot sauce. Exactly as years before! Happiness!",1
"I had high hopes for Eats after reading the positive reviews on Yelp, but unfortunately my experience was not as positive. I sat at the bar and ordered the Spanish Style Gulf Shrimp appetizer.  It was served with two pieces of toasted French bread on top.  The dish was too greasy because the shrimp was swimming in a bland garlic butter sauce. So I asked the bartender Svettana for some fresh lemon to see if squeezing some juice in the sauce and on the shrimp would make the dish taste better.  It didn't. I even dipped some toast in the sauce, and the two tasted horrible together. 

I am not a chef, but I could have done a better job myself making this dish at home.  I would have seasoned the shrimp overnight and used less butter during the cooking process. 

If an appetizer does not pass ""go"", then I certainly will not order anything else to eat on the menu--no main course and no dessert. First impressions mean a lot.  Overall, Yelp reviews are average for Eats, so it is not worth it for me to try this restaurant again. I am giving Eats two stars for fair food but good bar service.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The backyard is really beautiful and the drinks are really good. I especially loved the truffle burger and the Kevin bacon (eggs Benedict) dish. The only downside is that the restaurant can get a bit crowded, but that's to be expected during brunch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot!",1
"I ordered this as a Uber eat delivery during quarantine and I have to say the desserts came perfect. All the desserts were spot on. I ordered the matcha lava cake that was a delectable blend of chocolate and green tea. In the lava cake, there was a gooey warm chocolate filling and the ice cream complemented the cake perfectly. We also ordered chocolate chip cookies which were huge and soft and gooey. They were amazing. We also got (I don't remember the name) a dessert that had cornflakes and was flakey. It was delicious. I could eat that everyday. I can't wait to try this place in person but for delivery it was amazing.",1
"3.5/5 Boyfriend literally couldn't stop gushing about the conch with tofu dish after eating here for the next few months. Every time we walk past this place again (it happened a lot), he would go, ""Do you remember that time we had the conch here? SO good!""With that said, the food here is pretty good. BUT. It is also very oily and on the saltier side, so if you can handle that, then come here! If you can't, then make sure you tell the waiter to make everything less salty. (We always forget to say something like that.)Conch with Yellow Chives and Tofu ($45): personally, I don't care for conch, but it was very crunchy and good. The tofu was more of the star for my belly - super crispy, flavorful, and the inside was very soft and moist. Loved it. But this was easily the saltiest thing I'd ever had!Salt and Pepper Pork Chops ($15): more fatty pieces covered by the fried golden exterior, but also juicy and delicious to eat. Pieces were smaller than expected, and not very generous with the portions. Emphasis on that SALT of salt and pepper pork chops",0
"Comparable to Denny's, but falls short on flavor, yet is twice the price and half the portion sizes. The shakshuka is watery-thin. The tomato sauce is hardly flavored; the tomato flavor is barely comes through, so when you try to dip your bread in to catch some of the sauce, it just drips off. The jalapenos are a bit rubbery in texture, and don't add to the flavor of the dish, but are rather confusing as to why their presence is there, like an unwelcome guest at a party. The eggs are the only part done somewhat-right, and even then they were bland and unassuming.The nova benny was...not appetizing. The egg was poached, but was rubbery in texture in the tendrils of the egg white wrapping around the yolk. The kale was chewy, tough, and bitter. The bread holding it all together at the bottom was both soggy yet hard. The salmon was chewy and a bit hard to cut through.The only redeeming part of the meal were the drinks. While standard, the cappuccino was hot and frothy. The figging kidding was a bit sour, a bit sweet, and refreshing.",0
"I really loved the food and the ambiance here so I wish I could give it more stars. The first time I came I was very impressed. I was sort of in between meals at the time and wanted something light. They had like a snack size portion of the massaman curry was which was exactly what I was looking for.I was excited to return. I called ahead of time at around 2 pm to check when the lunch special is until. They told me it's until 4:30 pm. I came at 4 pm to try their lunch special. I was told their store is closed from 4-5 pm. I was like, ""okay but I just called and checked and was told the lunch special is until 4:30"". She said sorry but basically implied that I needed to leave. I just find it very disrespectful when businesses first lie to the customer by providing false information over the phone and then subsequently when they arbitrarily close down midday but do not put their correct hours on any of their sites (yelp, google etc.). I went to Thai market instead. If they could be more straightforward and honest with their timings, I would consider returning as the food and ambiance were lovely.",0
"Ever since @inday_nyc is back open, I am addicted to their bowls! Especially the miso salmon bowl. We got the veg indian buffet bowl (with basmati rice, summer greens, spiced chickpeas, roasted cauliflower, cucumbers and cilantro chutney) and Miso salmon bowl (loved it! Miso salmon, napa cabbage, ginger miso dressing, coconut summer beans, INDAY slaw and superseed crisp). I got this twice in a week and wasn't disappointed Ps: Also get their sparking brewed tea! It goes perfectly with their bowls",0
"first time at Yoon Haeundae galbi and maybe we expected too much. We ordered marinated short rib, busan neighborhood pancake and a few cocktails. cocktails were average and I thought pancake was overpriced.. pancake size was smaller than I expected (when you pay $23 for it) and only a few pieces of galbi and shrimp in pancake, but it was good to try once. galbi was good, but was not amazing. normally Korean bbq places change grills frequently, but they wiped our grill with paper towels and left them on the table while we were eating which wasn't very pleasant at all.. not changing grills definitely caused burnt flavors to meat and bitterness.This place can be nice for business dinner or to introduce Korean food to my non-Korean friends, but I would rather go to Jongro for Korean bbq.",0
"I went to this restaurant with my college friend and it was a lot of fun. The tacos were deceivingly filling, but I ended up ordering the appetizers as the main entree. The food I ordered was really good with leftovers to take home. I ordered the sangria, which was really good with the tot-chos with the chili and grilled Mexican corn. I also requested to take the corn out of the cob. The only downside was that the sangria was a bit too sweet for my taste. But overall, I would recommend this spot.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The chicken was absolutely amazing - it was the best Chinese chicken I've ever had. I also ordered the pork chop and it was also really good. I didn't leave unhappy at all!,1
"Came here for lunch at 11 on a Sunday and there was no line! The ambiance was nice and servers were friendly. They let me sit and wait for my friend who came later and my cup was always full.Ordered the single burger (single is a double, double is a triple) with an egg. The burgers came out quite quickly and looked delicious. The patties weren't average sized. Upon the first bite, I was surprised by the flavor. Not to say there's a lack of it, but I think I expected more. The burger was still good and the egg made up for the taste. The burger with the egg came out to $20, which is quite pricy. I think it could use a bit more flavor.Also got an order of fries ($9) that was actually the savior. The fries weren't a lot, but they made it up in flavor. The fries were thick and extremely crispy and tasty. This was definitely was the money for me.Over all, I think the place is worth a try if there's no line. I don't think it lived up to the hype where I'd wait 5 hours just to try the burger as I think there's better options at that point.",0
"I had a really enjoyable time at Farida Central Asian Cuisine & Grill! The food was amazing - everything tasted great and was very well seasoned. The prices were a bit on the higher side, but I think it was worth it. The service was also prompt and friendly. The only downside was that we couldn't find our reservation, but that worked out in a pinch. The atmosphere was nice and bright, and the decor was cute. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"My cousins and I decided to meet up for dinner and this place did not disappoint! It's on the second floor and was already starting to get busy when we walked in. Assorted Gui (5/5): This was a grilled dish assortment of small and large intestine, two slices of potato, and onions. It was really delicious! Super fatty intestine pieces with the large one being extra chewy. The onions grilled in the fat gave it extra flavor. Definitely the star dish of the night.Pork Belly (5/5): The pork belly pieces were extra crisp and came with a side of grilled onions, lettuce, ssamjang paste, garlic and jalapeños. Super yummy put altogether, nothing more.Beef Casserole (4/5): It's not actually a casserole, it's literally soup. Comes with beef, variety of veggies, and glass noodles. It was a bit too salty for my liking but eat it with rice and it will balance it out. Tteokbokki (5/5): I love love love rice cakes! It wasn't spicy at all. It came with a boiled egg split in half, thinly sliced carrots, and THICK rice cake pieces. I really enjoyed eating this dish.Service was excellent. Our server came back multiple times to help cook our food to perfection and was very kind.",0
"I went to the new restaurant in Chelsea, and it was okay. The stand out pieces were the shima aji, trout, caviar-uni-toro, and shiro ebi. I didn't like the lotus root wrap scallop.",1
"I'm giving Balthazar a 3 based on my experience which only consisted of brunch.  This was my first time here and I would come again to give it another shot during a different time of day, but for brunch I was not impressed.  I should start by saying that the place is absolutely lovely.  High-ceilings, white table cloths, wooden accents all around you.  It looks like something from the movies (and of course, it is).  I had the corned beef hash and it was something I would've expected from a diner, not a self-billed upscale restaurant.  The corned beef was very sweet almost a syrup flavor to it and I really didn't enjoy it at all.  The potatoes it was served with were bland, the egg was fine.  I was with 4 others and everyone had something different--no one ranted and raved about their dish, everyone's response was that it was ""okay"".  We had the Le Panier (pastry basket) and I did enjoy the chocolate croissant and cranberry bread but, again, nothing I felt the need to write home about.  It's a beautiful place with so many great reviews I would come back for a dinner meal and see how it goes, but as for brunch I was not impressed even though I was really expecting and hoping Balthazar for a great meal.  At the price point, it was a let down.",0
"I had a really enjoyable meal at Barbounia! The branzino was really flavorful and the potatoes, haricot vert, and hummus were all really good. I was a little surprised that they didn't give olives or tomatoes, but the beans were a bit stiff. The bread was also really good and had a pretzel-like exterior. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",1
"Food was delivered in 20-30 minutes!! Giving Raku 5 stars for efficiency and value for money. The bento box is around $21 and comes with 6 pieces of sushi rolls of your choice, an appetizer (get the Gyoza), rice, 2 orange slices and a main. I selected the Pork Katsu as my main for an extra dollar and the pork was a little tough - would have given the restaurant 4 stars because of this but everything else made up for it. The sauces for the Gyoza and the Katsu were just right  in quantity and perfectly complimented the dishes. My favorite item was probably the rock shrimp tempura which was just the right amount of spice, was pretty sizable in portion and was crunchy. Definitely a stable takeout place.",0
"Delivery during quarantine! Got delivery and it really hit the spot. Been craving dim sum and Chinese food so much!!!!!Ordered a few items:- dim sum ha gao AMAZING, tasted as good as restaurant's getting flushed in cart. Good like flushing good!! - dim sum siu mai was GOOD/ok - shanghai dumplings was OK- salty fish and chicken fried rice GOOD, it had all the right ingredients, but the dish tasted like it was slightly missing that wok heat",0
"I'm not sure what the hype is about, we had the cactus (Nopal) tortilla and the quesadilla and both were tasteless and small. The Mariscos next to it was way better, they even have shrimp and fish tacos, whereas here at Los Tacos they only have chicken and pork as meaty options. Not worth standing in the long line.",0
"Marian's is a new spot that replaced the short-lived Banty Rooster. The menu is short, but everything we tried was delicious. The Focaccia ($9) and the Crudo were both exceptionally good. We tried both pastas too, which were great, especially the Pappardelle. For dessert, try the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart.",1
"I ordered delivery from this restaurant today and I was really impressed! The food arrived really quickly and it was really good value for the lunch special - I would definitely recommend them. The chicken and broccoli were both delicious and the rice was really nice and fluffy. Overall, a great experience - thank you!",1
"They're currently reservation only due to covid. The spots open at midnight, two weeks in advance, and get filled extremely quickly. It took me two or so tries to secure a spot for dinner, so you have to be quick! They have table and bar seating options. We got the Ja Jang Style Ribs, Wagyu Ramyun and Lamb Ja Jang Myun. Honestly I would come back just for the ribs alone. They were extremely tender and paired well with the potato salad banchan on the side. I was a bit skeptical at first since 30 for an appetizer is pretty steep, but it was well worth it. The wagyu in the ramyun was delicious, with the slices of wagyu just melting in your mouth. The bansuk egg was excellent as well. The ja jang myun was okay, it had a bit of spice and a lot of the flavors were situated at the bottom of the dish, but I think it falls a bit short in comparison to the other two dishes. Bonus: if you're curious about how the restaurant runs and the prep it takes for some of their most popular dishes, there's an excellent video on the Youtube channel About to Eat titled ""Day In The Life of A Michelin Star Chef""",0
"We stopped in at this restaurant after being in the area and tried the Vodka, White & Pepperoni slices. Pepperoni was good - the pepper flavor was a little bit on the sweet side, but it was still good. The white slice was great - with the cheeses, it was the winner for me. The vodka slice was also great - with the sauce, it was yummm. The square slice was also very good. The location is more of a grab-and-go place, and there's not a lot of seating - but the staff was nice and friendly. The prices are very cheap all around, and the slices are Sicilian-style. I would definitely come back and check them out again.",1
"I visited Curry Goat Stew in the city and it was very crowded. It's a small place, but probably worth the wait. The atmosphere is friendly and good vibes. My food came out quickly and hot, but not so quick that it seemed to be waiting under a heat lamp. The goat stew is tender and falls off the bone just like it should. It has some spice, but it is not overpowering. The rice was a little overcooked, but still good when mixed with the stew. The roti was a nice touch, but I don't eat roti. The portion is great for the price. I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"I had a wonderful time visiting Rubirosa again after what feels like forever and it was so good to be reunited! The flavors in their pizza are so simple yet flavorful, and the simplicity of it gets me every time. Just know that their pizza is ultra thin, to the point that it almost feels like you're eating a thin crispy cracker with sauce and cheese on it. The fold factor was still there and ultra thin pizza just means more slices to eat!

Their roast octopus was perfectly charred on the outside and the inside was so tender that it felt like a dream. The crispy potatoes and creamy sauce contrasted nicely with the octopus and was a must try!

Their mozzarella sticks were fried cheese at its best! The cheese pull was perfect and the marinara sauce had a slight kick, which I enjoyed!

Their arugula salad was another favorite of mine and the combination of the bite from the arugula, bright acidity of lemon, and savory saltiness from the cheese made for such a great combination. As of this review, indoor dining requires vaccination proof (vaccine card and ID to match the names). Otherwise you can request outdoor dining but know that outdoor seating is limited!",1
"What an amazing find while we were visiting NYC the weekend after Thanksgiving. Once we arrived in Manhattan, I yelped for restaurants in the area. Turns out I had already bookmarked this restaurant (and I don't remember doing so at all). I must have read an article a while ago for me to save this. Anyways, it was one of the best dining experiences we've had. We ordered 3 appetizers for our main: steamed dumplings with chili soy sauce, Vietnamese chicken wings with crispy garlic and amazing dipping sauce, spare ribs with honey tamarind glaze and an order of crab fried rice with spicy green sauce & chili fish sauce. Each sauce complemented the dish really well, and we can't get enough of it. I must say the chef de saucier at OBAO is truly a master of mixing & pairing spices that make dishes truly delectable. Hubby and I were very impressed with how delicious everything was. From the excellent service to the oh-so-scrumptious food that was laid out in our small table, it's 5++.Some restaurants post beautiful photos of their specials but once it is served, they don't look as good as the photo does. At OBAO, what they served us looked exactly like what was posted on their website. We cannot wait to come back in the spring time as there's a lot of other items on the menu that we would love to try. Actually, we want to try them all so that will take multiple trips, lol. I just read the owner's profile and they are cousins Chai & Ace. Kudos to you two - for melding excellent Thai & Vietnamese dishes together at OBAO. Please, please, please open one in Southern CA .",0
The pancakes are a must-try at this restaurant! The Christmas special pancakes are a delicious way to celebrate the holidays. The server was quick to fill our drinks since we got the unlimited option for $25. I would highly recommend making a reservation or sitting at the bar to get the best seating.,1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but the prices were a bit high. I especially liked the sauce that came with the camarones cuzo - it was creamy and tasty. I might come back to try the chicken dish, which looked to be a popular item. The decor is very unique, so I'd recommend checking it out if you're looking for a unique restaurant experience.",1
The food was delivered quickly and it was all good! I would order from them again.,1
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! They have some great outdoor seating and the service was great. I only tried the mushroom sloppy and thought it was really good. The portion is a bit smaller than I would've liked, but overall I enjoyed it. I'm definitely curious to try more of the menu!",1
"This place is the only Michelin star restaurant I know in the city right now that's doing their full set menu for outdoor dining which is remarkable, so kudos to them for staying the course.I came here over the weekend for their seven course signature, which is currently:+ Osetra Caviar+ Octopus (fave #1)+ Branzino+ Tuna Kimbap (fave #2)+ Galbi (fave #3)+ Huckleberry+ Baby BananaAdditionally, there is a cucumber miso cleanse (or something like it) as well as amuse bouche at the beginning plus petit fours at the end. It's a two star Michelin spot so naturally the food was divine.However, outdoor dining comes with its challenges. While the majority of the tables are under cabanas there are two two-top tables that are in the street and not as protected from the wind. Unfortunately, the evening we went it was a bit windy so we asked to be moved to a cabana once one opened up. The reason why I took off a star is because we had asked to be moved to a cabana very early on in our evening, and then a couple came 30 mins after us and got moved into a cabana before we did. Right in front of me, #rude. While we did get moved to a cabana later, I'll state that we did not drop $300pp to see this play out in front of us.Nonetheless, I do believe Jungsik has exceptional food and I am sure having it as part of the indoor dining experience is lovely. However, I recommend that you be humble about your expectations of the experience, food and service wise, moving forward while outdoor dining is still the norm.P.S. I do give their restroom bidet an honorable mention bc those are always dope.",0
Loved my visit here! Great music! Good vibes. Good service. Food was good. Definitely a vibe in here!! It's pretty loud so if you're looking for a quiet place this is not it! Drinks were on point. Left with a nice buzz! Would come back.,0
I stopped by for a quick bite at this restaurant and I was not disappointed. The shrimp toast was excellent. The toast was crunchy and had a taste of shrimp paste and well seasoned sauce. Anything that is pan fried will taste better and this is no exception. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"The chicken sammish at this restaurant was delicious, but the buffalo sauce overpowered the sandwich. The fries were also delicious and did not disappoint. The only downside to this restaurant is that it is a little sketchy. The service was great, though.",1
"I came here with my girls a week ago. Delicious pizza let me tell you, their grandma style pie is very cute! But filling as well. I got the vodka pie. It has basil and I ordered it with a side of chili flakes. Fulfilled my craving of pizza for the week this day. I liked their cocktails too. It's def the spot for a delicious warm bite when you're around!",0
"Viand Diner aka Viand Cafe at this location is in the Beacon Hotel close to the Beacon Theater. I lived nearby for many years and I still visit this neighborhood as much as I am able. I find all the Viand locations are below my expectations. It's overpriced. The service is old school which is costly. It's okay when I'm are nearby for a show or movie. I'm not going out of my way to eat here. I know it's popular with some people, I have to be honest. This is not the Viand I remember from years ago when it was on East 86th Street! When that location closed I tried the others and it just isn't the same.......",0
"I visited Luke's Lobster for lunch recently and the lobster roll flight caught my eye. It comes in three different flavors, lemon butter, mala mayo, and truffle butter. I thought the mala mayo was very creative-- it featured mala spice-infused kewpie mayo from Omsom, which enhanced the sweet lobster meat and gave the sandwich a good kick. It was definitely the one to wake me up, as the lemon butter and truffle butter were good but not nearly as satisfying. Overall, I would say Luke's Lobster is a fairly dependable chain for solid lobster rolls.",1
"Small unassuming space that's cash only. No fuss, don't expect to make small talk and bond with the waiter. They let the for speak for itself - delicious Asian comfort food. As you walk through the door they immediately ask how many in your group and usher you to a table. We got in and seated just before the lunch rush. The place filled up fast. There are 2 larger tables of 6 in the center with tables of of 2 or 4 lining the walls. The food comes out quickly. Perfect for a quick lunch stop. Honestly everything we ordered was perfect. Especially their namesake, the Porkchop Over Rice dish. The porkchop is cooked perfectly with great flavor and accompanied by pickled veg that really balances the whole dish. I was initially put off by the looks of the salt and pepper chicken. The sizing was inconsistent with a lot of smaller pieces and I was worried those would be hard and overcooked. But every piece had the right bit of crunchy exterior and soft juicy interior. There aren't big visible flakes of pepper like some other places but you definitely still taste it.Very reasonable pricing with good portions of great food! Would definitely go back and hopefully I'll leave room for dessert next time.",0
"After a lot of research I decided to try the Hraime skillet and Ktzitzot pita (monthly special). The fish was tender with a nice hint of smoke, but the tomato sauce could have been more flavorful for mopping. Was very disappointed that the pita on the side was cold. The Ktzitzot was moist and went well with tahini sauce. Overall everything was good not great - not entirely worth the price.Two service-related complaints:The directions for bussing your own table were unclear. I did not know if/how I could get water or dispose of my plates (not everything was disposable).Twice the music suddenly got VERY loud for a few songs and then quieted down again, which was disturbing.",0
"Loved our dinner here. They practice Covid safety guidelines and the restaurant itself was beautifully decorated with a great atmosphere. Service here was friendly and our food came out really fast and piping hot. My husband and I ordered a bunch of stuff on the menu: blue willow spicy bean sea bass, mapo tofu, mama lou's famous beef stew, and Xiang xi fried rice. Everything tastes great! The fried rice had pickled green beans that went great with the fried rice and the mapo tofu tasted authentic and had such a great numbing spiciness to it. The beef stew had lots of mushroom and beef in it that we thought was well worth the price tag and it comes in those things that keeps the soup nice and hot for you. Our least favorite was the fish only because everything else tasted so good. The fish was huge but the sauce for me personally was too sweet. Their menu is so huge with great reviews so we figured it's better to come back next time with more ppl to try more dishes.",0
"We had a great lunch at this restaurant! The downstairs area is right by the bar area, which looks very cool and grand. Definitely interested in checking that out in the future. The food was really good. I had the tuna tartare appetizer, which was delicious... they had cut the tuna into small squares, and added different sauces and flavors, which went really well together. I would definitely return for this alone. I also had the sea bass entree, which comes on a bed of spinach rissotto. The price was a little high, but not unreasonable given the venue. Everything was tasty, and I may have enjoyed the risotto even more than the bass!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The portions were small, but the food was really good. I especially loved the deviled eggs and burrata. The only downside was that it took a long time for our food to come, but that's to be expected in a busy restaurant like this. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal!",1
"It has solid falafel sandwiches but I am only reviewing chicken tacos this time.  It is different in that they crisp the tortilla.. I am used to warming it up.  The crispy parts are ok and manageable but just...not what I am used to.  They give generous add-ons and also includes parmesan. Again, a first for me.  I am used to shredded cheese or fresca but the long strands of parmesan makes it feel very gourmet-ish.  But it still works.  The tacos come out piping hot--- so beware.  They come in 3s... which is a meal already.5 stars for the final product!",0
John's is a great place to go before a show in the Broadway show district. The atmosphere is casual and you can wear what you want. I had the Chicken Parm with Pasta and a Salad ($25.00). It was very good. I will try the eggplant parm next time. The waitress was the best--you can tell she has been doing this a long time. She was able to handle menu substitutions and modifications without flinching and with a smile.,1
"I thought Eataly was a bit overhyped and overpriced. The food itself at La Pizza e La Pasta wasn't seasoned as well as I would've liked, and the food was just overpriced for the quality and quantity. Some of the other stores were cool and had interesting selections of Italian meats, cheeses, pastas, cookies, etc but something about the entirety of my time at Eataly just felt forced. Maybe I went on a bad day, so I think I'll give them another shot on day in the future.",1
"I came to this restaurant to meet up with a group of friends, and I personally only came for their happy hour specials. I enjoyed my time here and ended up ordering a snack later in the night. The beers are $6 during happy hour, which is a price you cannot beat. The draft selections for the happy hour is phenomenal as well: Sapporo Lager, Six Point Pilsner, and Ithaca Flower Power. Wells drinks are $10 during happy hour. There are three select cocktails they offer for happy hour: Beeline, Serrano Margarita, and Charlie Collins for $12.

For my late night snack, I got the Truffle Fries. I've had these before at the Koreatown location, so I know they're good, especially the dipping sauces that comes with it. For $8, it was worth it and I pretty much ate the entire thing myself.

I will be back again for their happy hour specials between 4pm-7pm. These deals are too good to pass up.",1
"I absolutely love Wu's Wonton King! The food is always so fresh and the preparation is always very well done. The dumplings are my favorite item on the menu, but I also enjoy the roasted suckling pig very much. The staff can be a bit impatient at times, but overall they're very friendly. The location is also great, right next to the F train. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some delicious dim sum.",1
"Buffalo Wild Wings is a great place to go for some delicious wings! However, I was not impressed with the service here. It was pretty slow and the waiters were not always able to attend to my needs. Additionally, they charged me for ordering extra ranch when it was usually included in the wings. I would recommend this place, but only if the service is good.",1
"Just like their other locations, great quality gelato, nice presentation and the service is very individualized and attentive, despite being busy.As a vegan, I love the sorbet options. I always recommend chocolate sorbets because most gelato places do a very creamy, naturally dairy free dessert.All of the fruit flavors were good, but it does get sweet after a while so I would need to share it.",0
"Solid Thai place. I went here for lunch based on the other reviews and they are as advertised. Staff is friendly. Food is authentic Thai and they have synch specials that hit the spot. I tried the fried tilapia with fried tofu as an appetizer and both were very good. The tilapia was both crispy and flaky and the sauce was where the spice came from. The veggies were on the side, so no sauce on them. I would have preferred a little more sauce, but that's just a minor quibble.",0
"Such a disappointment. We were looking for Thai food near Columbia and this place was ranked high by Yelpers.  We can't understand why after eating there.The Pad Thai tasted as if a student had tried to make it in his/her home kitchen and only had tomato sauce on hand.  It was more like spaghetti and sauce than Pad Thai.  Hardly any peanut stuff either.  The other wide noodle dish with shrimp was just OK.  The calamari was fine.Also, the staff seemed to be much more interested in gossiping and laughing with each other than serving patrons.A $50 dinner- such a waste!",0
"I had a great breakfast at this restaurant! They have 4 types of oatmeal - regular, with skim milk, steel cut, and with quinoa and coconut - and I asked for a mix of 2. The oatmeal was delicious, with a good balance of sweetness and flavor. They also give you 3 toppings, but I just wanted fruit (blueberries and strawberries) so I didn't use them. The total cost was $10.50. I would definitely return to this restaurant, and recommend it to others.",1
"I came last night February 25th for a birthday celebration. 

I would give this restaurant 4 starts but the server Antonio was aweful. He was slow and inattentive. Also my lamb chops were very good but the food was cold. I would give 5 stars but you lost a star for serving cold food.

Lamb Chops 4 stars
Host Cassidy 5 stars
Drinks 4 stars
Service 1 star
Ambiance 5 starts

I did like the restaurant and I will be back again. Hopefully my server will not be Antonio.",1
"Service  Food       Ambiance I have never shopped at Neiman Markus, and therefore, never even knew there was a wonderful restaurant held within. Very happy my girlfriend T took me there! In Chicago it's called Mariposa, New York, Zodiac. I've only done brunch there, which starts with a huge popover, and an amazing chicken consommé.  Consommé takes skill and theirs is amazing. Clear and full of chicken.flavor. Major kudos! Tresa loves the popovers with strawberry butter. I do too but it's a reason she will go there. Mimosas and brunch....perfect. Last time she had the lobster Benedict and I had the burger ( not a huge breakfast person). Both were spot on. More expensive that I would usually choose, but such a perfect spot to take a significant other that it's absolutely worth it. In New York, at Zodiac, it was T and I and three of her closest friends. We had an amazing meal, great conversation, and our server Rhoe ( assuming I mangled the spelling) made our meal even better. Honest and attentive, a rare thing in a server. So, I wouldn't stop there by myself for lunch, but with a significant other or with a couple of dear friends, it's very worth it!",0
"Overall, I have to say that Rosa Mexicano is a great restaurant. The atmosphere is really cool, and the staff is fast and efficient. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high, but the food is really good. I recommend trying the frozen Margaritas, as they're really delicious. Overall, I'd give Rosa Mexicano 4 out of 5 stars.",1
"Overall, I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. However, I did have a few issues. The one star deduction is mainly due to the fact that the meal had raw food, which I think is an automatic one-star deduction. The pancakes had good flavor and the vegetable roll was cooked through and crispy. The soup was also decent. The one issue I had was with the chicken seaweed broth soup. It was raw and the chicken was surrounded by gelatinous broth. I would only order this if it were cooked through.",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The food was flavorful and packed with flavor, and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food you received. I would definitely come back here and recommend it to others. The only downside was the weak coffee, but the strong ginger flavor made up for it. The service was good and the atmosphere was cozy.",1
"The Mexican Chorizo scramble is definitely tastier than the typical scrambled eggs, but it's also quite small for the price. The rest of the menu looks interesting and I may come back to try some of their other dishes.",1
"I haven't been to B Cafe in a few years, but thought it would be a great spot for a birthday brunch. I called to make a reservation for a large table in the garden, and the host took all the information and said they couldn't specify garden dining, or outdoor dining at all, though large parties are ""usually seated in the garden or sidewalk shed."" I clarified that I was only interested in dining in the garden - we weren't interested in dining on the sidewalk and definitely not open to indoor dining, which is why I was making a reservation. Two years into a pandemic, this doesn't seem like an unusual request. The host said she would make a note about our preference and have her manager call me the next evening to sort it out. No one called me back the next evening, or the day after that. I decided to host the brunch at another restaurant with garden dining. A few hours before the reservation time, someone at B Cafe called to ask whether we still wanted the reservation.",0
"Bar Six is a great place to go with friends or family. The indoor space is comfortable and roomy, and the staff is easy to work with. The food is great, and the bathrooms are very clean. I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"Wow! Ordered some burritos for delivery and was pretty blown away by how good these are. Some of the options look heavy, like fries in a burrito, but it absolutely works and didn't feel like too much at all. We got the Congo with carnitas and the California with carne asada. Both meats were really flavorful and tender with the right amount of fat in the carnitas that made it juicy not dry. The rice in the Congo was also super soft and the beans were almost fluffy, mixed with the juicy carnitas and it was fantastic. I also loved the California which had fries but also a pico de gallo to balance it out. I also have to commend the tortillas here and their burrito wrapping skills. These burritos were wrapped so well there was no way it was ever coming apart, yet the tortilla was thin enough for the filling to wrap ratio to still taste right. Overall can't wait to try more off their menu!",0
"I had a really interesting experience at Dos Caminos, but I've never enjoyed their food. Every time I've gone, the food has been disappointing. The Margs are tasty, but the prices are really high for what you get. The Guac is $29, which is ridiculous. I also don't appreciate how they charge me for smashed avocados, which I would expect to get a show for. My last experience at Dos Caminos was really unpleasant, too. I ordered the Ceviche Sampler and the fish was old, slimy, stinky and inedible. I told our server that it was bad and he asked me what I wanted instead. I told him that he should go back to the kitchen and tell the cooks not to serve this to customers. The server grabbed the dish from me and didn't come back to our table. I guess the ceviche ended up on our check. I'm not a big fan of Dos Caminos, but their drinks are really pretty and fun.",1
"Love, love, love this place! Every time I am in NYC I like to pay a visit - always great people, service, food and drinks!!This tone we sat in the little outside seating area which is really cute and cozy! You get a cool view of the city and all it's going ons while it's heated and prettily lit!Enjoyed a FANTASTIC IPA - Rolling in the Clouds - a great and hazy IPA! Two great salads - Burrata which is one of the best Burrata's anywhere !! And the Kale which I have tried - albeit largely unsuccessfully- to recreate! We had two pizzas : Oscar the Grouch and Killer Bee and had to finish with desserts. The tiramisu is one of my faves anywhere and Panna Cotta!This is one of my happy places in NYC and cannot wait to come back again",0
"I had a great time at Joe Allen and Orso! The food was delicious and the service was friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. The only downside was that the burgers we ordered were not quite up to par. However, the waitress was very apologetic and made sure to fix the issue as soon as possible. I am sure that I will be back soon!",1
"Charm is officially my favorite Thai takeout spot in the Harlem/upper west side area. Yesterday I got the lunch special which is ONLY $8.50 for an entree and appetizer. I got the red curry spicy and chicken tom yum soup. The chicken red curry is my absolute favorite and the lunch special is such a great deal. My roommate got the drunken noodles lunch special and loved it. I love that Charms red curry is so flavorful and they put slot of chicken in so you totally get your money's worth. For $8.50 I had lunch yesterday and have leftovers to eat today so I don't have to go out during our nyc snowstorm. Service is also incredibly kind, I went in person for the first time yesterday and realized now that this is a take out strictly joint, there is NO seating. The woman at the register so kindly gave me hand sanitizer from her own bag when I asked if they had any. Love this place, its now my go-to.",0
This restaurant is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a good meal. The service was great and the food was delicious. We especially enjoyed the 5 napkin burger and the kale salad.,1
"Aunt Jake's is a decent Italian restaurant. The meatball appetizer was good, and I liked the vodka sauce. The squid ink alle vongole was decent, but I wished it had a more briny taste. I do like that this place allows you to ""build your own"" pasta into any combination. The server was also meh. We asked for bread sticks 4x and each time he said it would be coming out with our food. Nope, they never came and he never bothered asking if we got them. But the couple who came and sat next to us an hour in got some after they asked for it twice. I most likely won't be back as there are other Italian places I'd rather try.",1
"This is a great small noodle spot. I stopped by for a late lunch during the week. It was pretty empty (probably because it's new) but it was clean, staff was friendly and very attentive and welcoming. I like that they offer noodle soup and bubble tea. I had ginger tea with their beef noodle soup and both were very tasty. The soup bad a alot of flavor, perfect amount of heat balanced with a good noodle to protein ratio. I would definitely visit again if I'm in the area and I highly reccomend.",0
"I stopped by the restaurant the other day for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant has good reviews, but I was even more impressed with the location - it's right in between my sons' apartments and my hotel. The tuna poke nachos were packed with lots of fresh tuna, tomatoes, avocado, hints of lime, ginger, and soy sauce. It comes in a separate container to keep the chips fresh. The roasted Brussels sprouts were also amazing! They were sautéed in a Thai vinaigrette and sprinkled with peanuts and red chili flakes. Everything was packed neatly, including silverware and napkins. The menus are extensive, covering burgers, salads, and pasta. I'm definitely coming back - the Impossible Burger is definitely worth trying!",1
"The best thing about Brick Lane is the lunch special, which is available Monday-Friday from 12-4pm. For only $14, you get a curry of your choice, plus an additional vegetable curry, lentils of the day, rice, and naan. A great deal that has me taking days off from work just so I can experience it. The 

food is quite good but not extraordinary. The curry choices are arranged from most mild (tikka masala) to most spicy (the legendary phaal curry). I opted for the vindaloo, the second spiciest, which was too clove-heavy for me to really enjoy. The next time I came, I got the madras, which is the third spiciest one. It was a delicious and modestly spiced rich orange-colored sauce. I also couldn't resist ordering a side of the phaal curry (since I wasn't brave enough to commit my entire entree to it!) and it was very spicy as promised. I couldn't have eaten an entire plate of it, but I enjoyed using it as a garnish on my milder curry and on the lentil soup. It also has a lot of garam masala/",1
"Kitchenette is that quaint comfortable and cozy restaurant you go to when you want a good homestyle breakfast.Unfortunately an establishment I visit infrequently but I am readily reminded what I've been missing as soon as I walk in. More then just a breakfast spot you a greeted with an array of pastries as soon as you clear the threshold.On this particular day we came specifically for breakfast. With polite and prompt service,  I went with the ""Farmhouse Breakfast w/ meat"". The Farmhouse comes with a House baked buttermilk biscuit, cheese grits, eggs and turkey sausages. The food was great, the cheese grits and buttermilk biscuit with marmalade are memorable. My turkey sausages were not exactly how I recalled them, so I may skip those the next time.Overall as always and awesome breakfast and from now on I will try to make my visits a little  less infrequent. Just A Note:You must try their biscuits and the marmalade that accompanies them.",0
"Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The Eggs Benedict was definitely delicious, and the portion size was just right. However, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more salad in it. And I also found it to be a bit cramped inside, which made it difficult to move around. Additionally, I found it difficult to get a table for six here, which was a bit frustrating. All things considered, though, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Made a reservation for pre-dinner drinks on a Saturday at 5pm. Loved the ambiance! They have a pretty extensive cocktail list, heavily focused on gin. We must have come at a shift change because it took a while for any waitress to check in on our area (the other tables next to us hasn't been helped yet either). Once she did, my partner and I both ordered gin and tonics- the herbal for me, and the spice and tart for my partner. We also orderd a dozen east coast oysters. I really enjoyed my herbal gin and tonic- great flavor and a pretty looking drink. I don't do spicy cocktails so I didn't try my partners. He said it had quite a kick but after adding the extra tonic water he enjoyed it much more. The tart gin and tonic was unique and tasty. We were pleasantly surprised by how good the oysters were. I would love to come back to try more drinks!",0
"I had a great time eating at Canyon Road Grill last night! The hostess thoughtfully seated us under the heat lamp, and everything went smoothly from there. Our waiter was polite and helpful, and we were really happy with our upgrade to their special house margaritas - they were much less sweet and more potent than the ones we usually enjoy, which was exactly what we needed. The guacamole was delicious, and the fajitas were all very good - the variations we tried were all very tasty. The sides were also quite good, and the overall meal was above average in terms of quality and value. I'll definitely be back!",1
"Au Cheval is definitely a popular restaurant! We booked a 6:30 reservation for a Tuesday night, and it was pretty easy to do so. The fee for a reservation is a little strange, but I guess this is a popular spot so they can charge that.

We were seated at a cramped middle table near the entrance of the restaurant, and it was a little startling given the size of the place. It took a long time for our waiter to get to us and get us water. We ordered right away - I got the cheeseburger with egg and bacon and my fiancé got the regular cheeseburger. We also got a side of the fries with the garlic aioli.

The food came out pretty quickly, and I really enjoyed my cheeseburger. It was a bit heavy, but I was able to finish it up. My fiancé didn't like his regular cheeseburger as much - he mentioned that there was a Big Mac type sauce on it which he didn't care for.

All in all, Au Cheval was a good experience - I wasn't impressed by the service, but I did enjoy my cheeseburger. This place isn't necessarily the type of restaurant I need to come back",1
"I had a great experience at Arturo's! The lighting and music was perfect for a nice dinner, and the wine and food selection was great. The half-and-half pizza was perfect for groups, and the bread was delicious. The only downside was that the pizzas weren't ""out of the world amazing,"" but they were definitely good. I'm definitely going to visit again!",1
"I love this place! It's a great find, and the drinks are really cheap. They have a great selection of beers, and the atmosphere is really cozy. The only downside is that it's a bit out of the way. But overall, I give it five stars!",1
"I stopped to eat lunch here in Chinatown with a group of 4 on a bustling Sunday afternoon. We sat ourselves in their makeshift outdoor seating - very hole in the wall vibes but it was air conditioned at least. You can either order at the cashier or the waiter can come to you. I thought the noodles were yummy and chewy! Their flavor was a bit bland, but pouring the provided table sauces really enhanced the meal by kicking the flavor up a notch. The duck was plentiful and roasted well. Quite large portions, so definitely would be great for some leftovers too. The pork soup dumplings were also tasty!Overall, this place is great & satisfying, but not worthy enough for me to eat at again for a while.",0
"The wait - we came around 1PM on a Saturday and was told the wait was going to be about 25-30 mins. We waited at the front along with the other parties. After 40 mins, we finally got a text that our table was ready. We went back on line, only to be told ""everyone else just got the text, can you line up again"". We were so confused. Not the most organized hereCool concept but lack of instructions - after we sat at our booth, no one came by so we basically had to figure out ourselvesCold eggs - an egg came with our order. The cold egg made it difficult to peel, my friend struggled a bit hahaHighly recommend to select lower sodium level. The normal one was very salty, I did not finish it",0
"There's always a long line here, but my friend and I came right when they opened and that's the sweet spot. Everything we had was delicious, and the service was great...except for an odd thing that happened. We started off with Anthony and then in the middle of the meal another server was helping us, and he never introduced himself or said what happened to Anthony. When we tried to make conversation/quip with the new waiter, he was unbothered and uninterested. Not impolite, but just fine. Either way, the croissant rocked, the bacon was delicious and extra crispy (as asked), and you should absolutely get the hot sauce. A nice touch with the croissant is that the scrambled eggs were more of an omelet so the eggs didn't fall off the sandwich when you took a bite. They also have decent sized portions which I can always get behind.",0
Got the monthly special which unfortunately was not the donut collaboration one. The everything bagel chicken nuggets with jalapeño cream cheese dip was still pretty good. The nacho Mac and cheese hands down was absolutely incredible- that is if you enjoy a creamy cheesy Mac! Definitely will be stopping by again to get other flavors and possibly even for some yummy drunchies!,0
"I was really disappointed with Nocciola, but I decided to give this place a try anyway. Boy, was I wrong. The veal meatballs were the smallest I've ever seen and the Caesar salad was pretty terrible. The rigatoni's were also pretty terrible, as they were soggy and tasteless. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. My Peruvian girlfriend had a yen for ceviche so we tried it out. We got the basic ceviche with fish and we also got the beef hearts appetizer. The beef hearts were OK but seemed a overcooked to me. It came with a side of corn and fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were completely bland and flavorless. The ceviche was meh. I thought it had way too much lime but my girlfriend, the ceviche expert, said that's how it's supposed to be. She also said the fish should be thicker and raw though. This fish was small cubes and completely cooked. The worst part is after eating a few spoonfuls of ceviche, we found two hairs in the fish! 

Our waiter, who didn't come to check on us once throughout the meal, was informed of the hairs and took the fish away. We asked for the check instead of another plate of the fish. He said he spoke to the mgr and apologized. Problem is he didn't take the dish off the check! We had to ask for it to be removed! So overall, the food was lackluster with hair in it and the service was sub",1
"I ordered this as a drunken impulse really late at night, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and price! Definitely will be coming back, I got one of the combos and it was delicious and flavorful. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the rice was cooked perfectly as well. The only complaint I could think of was that I wished the chicken had been a bit more spicy, but otherwise, it was a great meal.",1
"I came to this restaurant with a date and we were seated right away. The outdoor setup was really nice and the tables were evenly spread out. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. We ordered the calamari, pappardelle bolognese, and braised short rib. The calamari was a good appetizer to share and wasn't too greasy. The pappardelle pasta was good but the bolognese sauce was a bit bland. I would try another one of their pasta dishes instead. My date really enjoyed his braised short rib and cleaned his plate. The portion was big and the dish came with mashed potatoes. Highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for comfort food or a hearty meal!",1
So my girlfriend and I were hungry in the middle of night so we decided to get some Chinese delivered to our hotel! I got the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and my girlfriend got the shrimp fried rice with spring rolls! The food was good! It wasn't the best Chinese food ever but it hit the spot with our craving that night!,0
"(This review is only for the chocolate shop section of the restaurant.)The chocolate shop section has chocolate tins and boxes of chocolates as well as individual chocolates and truffles. The tins come in pre-packaged options but the boxes you can either choose pre-packaged or choose your own. They have gift boxes that are really reasonable in price ($25-30 for a small box of four different items) and limited edition gift sets (i.e. Easter gift sets) that you can get at a deal price. The dark chocolate covered caramelized pecans here are SOOOOO good (even though I'm not a fan of chocolate-covered nuts). They also have a chocolate-churning machine running in the front of the store which was cool to look at. The online store delivers (almost all of the in-store) products to anywhere in the country, so you can either have them delivered to you or a someone else. :)",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The assistant manager was attentive and provided great service. The scallops in the watermelon juice were refreshing, and the warm Uni inspired dish was the perfect entree. The desserts initially looked unassuming but I'm so glad that we ordered both because they both were delicious. I would caution about to take away boxes/bonchon, though. We ended up getting three and I regret to say that none of them were ever touched once they were brought home because of the very authentic seafood-y, Asian taste.",1
"Lupa is a great Italian restaurant in the summertime, but beware that it can get quite busy. The wine selection is very good, and our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered appetizers, pasta, and sides all together and the sides were our favorite part - Particularly the broccoli rabe and potatoes. The lobster burrata was interesting but not my favorite - the sauce was a bit too fishy for my taste. The carbonara pastas were on the salty side, but the gnocchi and short ribs ragu were both very good. All in all, Lupa is a delicious Italian restaurant that's well worth checking out!",1
We got the Christmas special pancakes and a burger and both were fantastic! The server was quick to fill our drinks since we got the unlimited option for $25. I would definitely recommend making a reservation or you can only sit at the bar.,0
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The pizza was amazing, and I especially loved the Grandma slice. My boyfriend and I got four slices, and we all thought the Bianco, the pepperoni, and the Margherita were great too. We would definitely come back and recommend this place to others.",1
"Got delivery for a chicken and lamb bowl, along with the chicken tikka.  The chicken and lamb bowl was TINY with only a few pieces of meat and predominantly lettuce.  Yes it is $6.99 but the portion definitely justifies the price!  The meat was also on the tough side.  The chicken tikka was also on the tough side and the sauce was a bit bland and watery as well.  The prices are low and delivery is fast if you are on the UES but the super fast delivery probably is indicative that the food is not freshly prepared to order.  There are better Indian options in the area - and worth a higher price and longer delivery time.",0
"I had a great experience at this Thai restaurant. The service was excellent and the waiter was very attentive. The decor is really nice and the seating layout is very open and inviting. The food was very reasonably priced and the portions were great. I especially enjoyed the Thai iced lemon tea, which was very refreshing and had a special tone to it. The mango spicy wok stir fry was also really good, with a kick to it. The drunken noodles were also very tasty. The restroom was very clean and well-maintained, and it really added to the overall experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Been a fan of this spot since I was a little girl. My parents been ordering from this store for as long as I can remember. Lately, these past few years, their food has been flavorless :/ . I ordered noodles and rice cakes today and both dishes didn't have much flavor, sadly. I even asked for extra flavor in the noodles but there wasn't extra flavor. I'll still come back whenever I'm in the city.",0
"First time ordering through seamless, delivery arrived within the given time frame. Order was packed tightly. Went with the parmesan tots, steamed pork and chives dumplings, 10pc soy garlic wings and rice. Total came out to be about $30. The tots were really good, just the right amount of cheese, not too overbearing. I'm not sure if their style of wings is soaked in sauce hence the ""Glazed Hen"" but my fried chicken was super soggy after being soaked in sauce. I saw a good amount of sauce on the bottom of the container as well. They missed the rice in my order, probably would've been better to wash some of the sauce with rice.",0
Always a long line. I went on a Sunday and waited like 40-45minutes at like 2pm. I was there for a late lunch but the line grew...so many people were going there for an early dinner. I got the original square pepperoni and a pesto slice. Delicious!!! Sauce is different and tastes homemade. I also got a fanta because by the time it was turn to order I was parched. Def worth trying at least once!!! As we were eating ppl kept asking where we got it from- so much have looked good to them too!,0
"Updating my review. Came back weekend of Valentine's Day 2022. Still overall happy with the omakase, but note prices are higher now ($225 per person at the bar or $200 if you book a table). The scallop is still one of my favorite pieces, but all the sushi pieces were solid. Don't think I care as much for the non sushi dishes other than the firefly squid: the sashimi or the amuse bouche (salmon croquette), a mushroom soup (clear broth with a few mushroom/snap pea pieces) were all fine but nothing to write home about. Dessert sorbets were also just ok, though unique in flavors (they served us different flavors - one of us got one with shiso as a key underlying flavor and the other a peach alcohol). Of the ""dessert"" items, the green apple hot tea was my favorite mostly bc it was such a fun sensory experience. Smelled really intense - like green apple sour candy, but actual flavor was light and not sweet/sour.",0
"When you walk in to order it's so greasy in the air you feel like you need to take a shower. Being brave we order anyway, to go. We waited outside because it was so disgusting. Also because all the seats were taken by the Chinese delivery men.  At least 7 of them. We got 1 order of steamed shrimp dumplings, 1 order of pan fried vegetable dumplings and 1 order of small vegetable lo mein. It's actually hard to write this review because it's making me remember how bad it all was.  Hahahaha",0
"I'll be honest, my expectations are low for rooftop bars because they often skimp out on food if they have a good view. That, my friends, is not the case at Electric Lemon. You can have your view and eat good too. And don't let the limited menu trick you - quality over quantity is the motto at EL. One of my long time friends selected this for a weekend brunch spot. I went with the eggs Benedict and I will go on the record and say it's probably one of the best I've had. It comes with these wedge potatoes that are perfectly seasoned. Paired with their arctic lemon (think refreshing lemonade frose), it was simply perfect. I'll definitely be back to try everything else.",0
{Overall: 3.5 - Food: 3.5} Atmosphere: 4; Service: 4The food is very standard brunch fare. You can't go wrong with any of the choices given that they all deliver on what you'd expect. The standout is the outdoor seating. Dogs allowed. Prime location in the Standard Hotel. Service is decent.,0
"The atmosphere at this restaurant is really special. 

The asparagus flatbread is a great appetizer, and the roasted cauliflower dish is delicious. 

The nachos were also really good, and the beer selection was top-notch.",1
"The Smith is a great place to get your food and drinks. They have a variety of menu items and the service is always great. I really enjoy the mac and cheese, it's very creamy and has a great flavor. The cocktails are also very refreshing. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded, so I recommend making a reservation.",1
"Cozy spot with authentic Korean food and specialty dishes that are pretty unique! This restaurant has really good house made tofu and soybean dishes. If you ever come here you should definitely try a dish with their tofu since it's their specialty!Came for dinner on a weekend and our wait for a party of 2 was around 30 minutes. Be sure to come earlier if you can to get your name on the waitlist since it gets pretty packed and busy, especially on weekend evenings. A big reason I love eating out at Korean restaurants is the free banchan / side dishes and the ones here did not disappoint! We were given kimchi, scallion pancake, vegetables, pumpkin, and seaweed. All of them were really well seasoned and clean tasting. I particularly enjoyed the seaweed and sweet pumpkin! We ordered the cold soybean noodles and the beef bulgogi hot stone bibimbap. The bibimbap tasted great with crispy rice, piles of vegetables, and a serving of bulgogi as well as their house made tofu. One of the better bibimbaps I've had in the area since every ingredient tasted fresh. I was really looking forward to trying the cold soybean noodles since this is a unique Korean dish that I have never tried before but my friends have raved about it. Unfortunately, the flavor was much more mild than I expected. I thought the soybean would be very pronounced and flavorful, similar to how other Asian cold noodle dishes like Chinese noodles where the sesame flavor is strong. This one was more just a slight aftertaste of soy and peanut. I enjoyed the bouncy texture of the noodles but I felt the broth / soybean flavor needed to be stronger in order for this dish to be elevated. We ended up not finishing this one. Overall still a great option for Korean food! I like how they serve dishes that many other spots in / near Manhattan K-Town do not offer, like the soybean noodle and soybean stews. Very cozy and authentic food. Would come back!",0
"*covid-19 outside seating experience*We went to Jongro around noon on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. The meat is grilled in their kitchen and then brought down to the tables outside. They no longer have the set options, which is a shame because that's all I used to get. The meats are definitely overpriced at $30-45 dollars per meat choice (1 person portion). As for the environment, the tables aren't super close together and the street is closed off so there are no car. You can use their bathroom, but you have to get a waiter to swipe you in the building and take the elevator to their store.",0
"I was very pleased with my experience at Burger & Lobster. The decor was nice, but the music was a bit loud, so it was hard to have a conversation. The linen napkins were a nice touch. The hostess and her assistant were both very pleasant. Our waiter came over and asked us what we wanted before we even had a chance to look at the menu. He delivered our food promptly and it was cooked exactly how we ordered it. The lobster roll was amazing, and the fries were warm. The salad was a bit small, but the dressing was definitely organic. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"I came here on a weekday and got their lunch special. You can get 2 starters and 1 entree for around $11 which is a really good deal! I tried their Shrimp Tom Yum soup, Chicken Coconut soup, Vegetable dumplings, and Vegetable Crispy Rolls. Both the soup taste okay, they're both pretty sour. I would not recommend the vegetable dumplings, you could definitely get better dumplings elsewhere, but the vegetable rolls were pretty good. For the entree I tried their chicken pad thai and chicken drunken noodles. Both entrees taste delicious! Overall, I prefer the entrees over the starters but the food is great for the price! I would definitely come back to try more entree dishes",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by my first experience at Boulton & Watt!You can now book Boulton & Watt via the Seated app which makes it super easy to get a reservation.They have an awesome cocktail/drink menu, in addition to a food menu that is sure to have something for everyone.

We made it in time for happy hour which meant $14 cocktails were only $9. A $9 cocktail in Manhattan is nearly impossible, so it was nice to know that this is a spot I'll return to for happy hour in the future! I opted for the Mexican Revolver, a tequila drink with prosecco, lime and agave. Simple, but not too sweet.

To start I shared the housemade burrata appetizer ($16) with roasted delicata squash, caramelized onions, grilled country bread,ricotta, aged balsamic, basil pesto. I love basil pesto so I knew I had to try this and can recommend this mix of bread, veggies and excellent buratta.

My main course was the tuna burger which was also delicious. It came topped with pickles, sriracha aioli, and slaw on a brioche bun. It was",1
"Overall, I had a decent experience at Effy's Cafe on the Upper East Side. The Avocado Toast was a bit disappointing, but the restaurant itself was spacious and well-decorated. The service was a bit slow and unprofessional at first, but the waitstaff was eventually very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this spot to others looking for a casual NYC dining experience.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The pizza was great and the buffalo chicken wings were fantastic. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but overall it was a great experience.",1
The food was definitely the best and most authentic dry pot Chinese food I've had in the city. The flavors were great and the customization was great too. The only downside was that it was very very expensive. I don't know if I could justify the price for the food that you get. I think everyone should at least try once and make a decision for themselves.,1
"Got here on an early evening for some drinks and a light dinner. My first drink is Tequila Time Machine recommended by our server, an amazing mix of passionfruit and tequila with some spicy salt, giving a refreshing yet exciting experience on your tongue. We got the chef's plate (cheese and charcuterie board), oysters and a pulled pork sandwich - very presentable as seen on the photo, with decent quality of everything. The chef's plate has also really big portions too and you can add more bread if you request. My second drink I Hear Banjos is a much stronger one with applewood smoke - a nice one to sip and enjoy through a while longer after the dinner. I was indoor but the outdoor space definitely looks nice when there is still daylight, would love to try doing that some time soon!",0
"I recently tried out Hometown hotpot in Little Italy and I have to say that I was really impressed. The broth was less oily and the selection of meats and vegetables was much better than at 99. The customer service was great, and the cheap beer was a nice touch. I will definitely be back next time I have friends visiting.",1
"This restaurant has long lines, but the food is worth it. The roast pork over rice is delicious, and the rice is cooked well. It's a great value for a cheap lunch.",1
"I came here with friends during restaurant week. I went to dinner all you can eat for $42. The menu was very simple, eat all you can eat from salad bar which had lots of options available and freshly madeThe main course consists of selection of limited meat for restaurant week: chicken (did not try); pork loin, juicy and not dry; pork sausage (did not try); prime rib, also juicy and not dry; top round steak, delicious; top sirloin, super delicious; and leg of lamb, delicious and well made From the sides I tried: french fries, great and crunchy; fried bananas, fresh and well made; and veggies, they were okFor dessert I ordered both. I felt the passion fruite mousse was way better than the chocolate one As I previously stated, since I came on restaurant week I got the toned down menu from the regular menu. I heard from my friend that the regular menu is more delicious and worth it. Thus, my experience from this place on restaurant week was A-OK. Comparing this experience with other brazilian places, I feel other places that I have been to are more worth it than this and cheaper than $42 for all you can eat... I would have to try out the normal experience during non-restaurant week to write its experience. But the normal experience is approx. $20 bucks more, approx. 60ish",0
"I had a great time at Parm! The pickup was smooth and the food was delicious. The mozzarella sticks were especially good, with great flavor and a touch of sweetness from the Mariana sauce. The chicken parm sandwich was equally delicious, with moist and flavorful chicken. It's a bit on the pricier side, but you do get what you pay for in terms of quality. I'd definitely recommend stopping by for a meal if you're in the area!",1
"While the service was the best thing going for this place, it lacked consistency with its menu, menu pricing, and flavor. The home fries were not good--they looked like shredded carrots and tasted like they were covered in a sealant (like shredded cheese). I walked out only paying $13 bucks I could have thrown away a lot here for a lot a of nothing.",0
"*Review of the non-hibachi menu* Came here on a Tuesday evening as a walk-in and there were multiple tables open for non-hibachi dining. The service was great and when we asked about happy hours, the waiter told me there's a happy hour for drinks until 7pm on weekdays (not sure about weekends) $6 for beer, $7 sake, $8 something.. but I ended up ordering two glasses of draft Sapporo so I didn't get to remember the rest of the happy hour specials haha. I ordered the Flame roll and crunchy spicy snow crab maki with avocado at an additional cost. As a Specialty roll, flame roll is $21 and it did not meet my expectations. The rice was overcooked and dense (and it felt not enough rice on the rolls), and the overall texture of the fish on either sushi did not *melt* in my mouth the way I expect pricier rolls to be. I don't think the fish quality and preparation were great. I came here for sushi and realized this place is better known for Hibachi, which the table sounded a lot of fun from constant entertainment and singing that I can hear on the non hibachi table.However, we were still hungry so we ordered the Thai pineapple basil fried rice and it was SO GOOD - I would come back here just for this. Even the rice that felt overdone on sushi tasted amazing and flavorful for the fried rice. I think we picked the wrong kind of table to sit here haha.Overall, the service was great, but the sushi wasn't up to par and I was a bit skeptical of many different cuisines on the menu as it's hard to pull off all dishes well. I say go with Hibachi but not the sushi.",0
"Overall, I liked Killer Bee Pizza, but there were some issues with their online ordering. I would recommend ordering through their website if you're able to, since it's easier than trying to call them. The pizza was good after reheating, and the customer service was good too.",1
"I was hesitant to try this restaurant because I've never been here before, but I'm glad I did! The mala dry pot was really good and the medium wasn't spicy at all, so I would definitely ask for that next time. The Sichuan boiled fish was also really good, and I would definitely recommend it. The restaurant is clean and the service is good, so I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Overall 5/5: We waited a long time to get a table, but it was definitely worth the wait. We were so full and content by the end of it! Food 5/5: We ordered a bunch just because we couldn't resist getting our favorites. We got turnip cake, snow pea tips, shrimp dumplings, pork shumai, salt and pepper squid (best i've ever had; it was super golden and crispy), tripe, pork buns, egg yolk buns, chicken feet, and shrimp rice noodle roll. Everything came out piping hot which is always 5 stars in my book. The turnip cakes were done exquisitely as they were crispy and flavorful. Vibe 4/5: We were seated in the downstairs area which was nice. Kind of quiet and private. Service 4/5: I was worried when we were seated downstairs that we would be forgotten about, but fortunately that wasn't the case. Our table constantly had food coming and our tea never stayed empty. Our server was great and patient with us. Thank you, Pings Seafood!",0
"The lunch prix fixe at Nougatine was a great value and the food was delicious. The standout dish was the tuna tartare, which was beautifully presented and delicious. The black sea bass was also very good, but the skin was a bit soggy. The side of uber creamy potato puree and basil vinagrette was a real standout, though. The apricot tart was a bit of a let down - the marzipan ice cream was the star of the dish, but it wasn't very good. The service was impeccable, and I would definitely recommend Nougatine for a casual lunch.",1
"With a little over an hour between performances, we went in for a drink. In 2015, we had dinner here and remembered one of the hostesses gave me a stern look when I complimented her looking like the dancer Misty Copeland. Must be my limited Chinglish. We sat at the bar and enjoyed some good drinks that are served in Rona glasses. Their open kitchen is orderly, smell-less and QUIET - the ventilators use Rolls-Royce engine or what  (just kidding) must top notch. ""Are they the most expensive equipments here?"" I joked.The bar tender said yes - hope he isn't patronizing me -:)",0
"Yet another NYC Italian restaurant crossed off! II Buco is a dimly lit restaurant with a lively atmosphere. We went around closing time, but there were still plenty of people enjoying their food and drinking wine. My friend reserved us a table in the wine basement, but they had a private party there at the time, so we sat at one of their regular tables upstairs. Their food is pretty good. We ordered bread, tagliatelle, and burrata. I didn't like the peas in the pasta as much, but it was a great light summertime pasta. Overall, service was great. I have to get used to getting just tap water without ice, but it's a pretty restaurant with rustic vibes.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant the other night. The kabob barg was especially delicious, and the ghormeh sabzi stew was a great way to end the meal. The eggplant appetizer was also very good, and the lamb shank was very tender. I was also impressed with the baklava dessert - it was definitely one of the best I've ever had. The service was attentive and the atmosphere was very authentic. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Persian meal.",1
"Our First ""day"" in SoHo, we were looking for our first Vegan meal, and Le Botaniste was on our to-do list. Upon entering it, you feel like you are stepping into a botanical shop, or even a apothecaries from long ago. The food is laid out in ceramic lined cast iron pots. Plenty of beautiful colors and fragrances, that one cannot be anything else but hungry. The food flavors were all on point, nothing too powerful or overbearing. Enjoyed some of the NY City's finest tap water, with our delicious meal. The Veggie Bites were nothing to write home about, and the green pea hummus, was, well...different? On the way out I met with one of the founders of this deliciously fun place to eat. I wish they were in Los Angeles, I think in West Hollywood they would thrive... for what they were offering.",0
"Not the 1st place I ate while in New York but it will be on the MUST COME BACK TO EAT HERE list for when I return! I was tasked with finding a place to eat after a show and this place caught my attention. I thought the price was right...I was familiar with the style of food to be prepared and I was successfully able to make a reservation for a party of 4 using Yelp. I love technology!If you've ever been to that other Hibachi place (rhymes with Henny Banna) then you know the drill. What sets Fuji Hibachi apart was the friendly personal service, lively engaging chefs and again...I felt the price was more than reasonable. I also liked that the place was a bit tough to find. Waaaay off the main drag but that's ok. Food: Go big. Order the Meal Plan that comes with the miso soup, noodles, proteins and all sorts of veggie goodies. Also If you're well behaved and your order comes with shrimp, yes the chef will attempt to toss a piece in your mouth. The shrimp toss is part of the show as is the huge bursts of flames that occasionally flair up! Did I mention the Onion Volcano? Fun times and all while grilling up some chicken and shrimp. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals as well. No problems.Misc:I do think the service was a-okay overall...the drink orders could have been taken a lot sooner. Other than that...nothing but good memories and food!Hibachi is not your thing? Sushi rolls and other Japanese plates are available to choose from.BY ALL MEANS...do make a reservation!Overall:Based on our party's experience I would absolutely come back! Recommended.",0
"The food at this restaurant is amazing! Everything I've tried has been really good, and the portions are generous. The only downside is that the place can be quite crowded, so it's not ideal for a romantic dinner. However, if you're looking for a place to eat with some friends, this is definitely the spot. The wine selection is top-notch too.",1
This is my first time getting the food here personally. My friend got it once before. I tried the roast pig and the skin was very good. So I picked up roast pig and duck over rice along with roast pig and roast pork. Hay hay hand pulled duck bun I was looking forward to it. The picture looks good. But when I received it and ate both of them. The proportions are terrible. There is like 2/3 vegetable and barely any duck.  What a rip off. Why not call it vegetable bun with topping of duck. The roast pork is okay. Not seasoned well enough. Same with the duck. The only really good thing I liked is the roast pig. The skin is very crispy. I came here maybe 5:30-6pm and the pieces I got for my duck were terrible pieces. All bone no meat. The pig was a little bit better. It seems like only the roast pork would you get more pieces. There's clearly still a lot of each meat left hanging. But the pieces were super disappointing. I would come back for the roast pig again and maybe try the chicken also. But besides the pig I wouldn't recommend anything else.,0
"I'm not sure what the hype is about, but I didn't enjoy our meal at Los Tacos. The cactus (Nopal) tortilla and the quesadilla were both tasteless and small. The Mariscos next to it was way better, they even have shrimp and fish tacos, whereas here at Los Tacos they only have chicken and pork as meaty options. Not worth standing in the long line.",1
Finally ate here and it is definitely a fast-casual venue where you order at the counter and then grab a seat.  It's interesting that they actually offer reservations!  The seating itself is very barebones so I would recommend just grabbing a to-go as it's not the most comfortable unless you are just grabbing a very quick bite.  They do have a basket of pre-wrapped rolls that you can grab for both dine-in and takeout - I actually prefer these to Hill Country's butter bread slices.  Some updates:1.  Skip the spare ribs - they are super dry and not at all flavorful.  One of the ribs was so dry that I couldn't even chew it without potentially damaging a molar.2.  The brisket is still the best item here but make sure you ask for a moist cut as a lean cut can be very dry.  The flavor of the meat is definitely on the bland side but there is BBQ sauce which somewhat mitigates that.  3.  The broccoli salad is also solid: creamy and sweet with bacon bits and dried cranberries.,0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The peanut dumplings are my favorite and I was not disappointed. The chicken dumplings are also yummy and I am excited to try the vegetarian version. The only downside is that the pork moo yang was not as good as I had hoped. The dipping sauce was not as good as Ayada or Dek Sen, but the service was very accommodating and helpful. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Overall, I thought Rasa was a great place for lunch. The menu is large and there is something for everyone. The lamb curry was delicious and I would definitely recommend it. The only downside is that it is a bit expensive, especially for lunchtime. The hot ginger tea is a nice touch and is a perfect way to cool down after a tasty meal.",1
"This place is great for empanadas! I was in the area and craving some, and I'm so glad I found this place. I ordered a couple of different flavors and everything was delicious. The pick was easy and the staff was super helpful. I'll definitely be back here!",1
"Absolutely love this place! One of the few resturants I dont mind visiting again and again. Love their brunch and dinner vibes.  It is a cute cosy restaurant, with some of the best playlist in the town.I am usually busy shazamming the songs while dining here.Everytime I go here, there service just gets better and better. Last week I dined here, resy had confirmed the reservation with me, but didn't notify the restaurant. Once we arrived there, the hostess( Sarah) couldn't find us in the system. Though the restaurant was packed, they managed to accommodate us and were very apologetic for the confusions caused by resy. They got us some complimentary shots and not just once, but twice because it was delicious!! They have a great selection of cocktails, and they make healthier versions by replacing sugar with agave. My fav dish is the Isaereli salad! So fresh and delicious. I end up ordering the same things usually- falafel latkes, hummus, shakshuka, the eggplant dish is delcious too! Definitely stop by if you looking for some yum Mediterranean food, great music, and service!",0
"Kyma is a pretty restaurant with clean surroundings, but the service is slow and awkward. The food is just okay - nothing stands out. Prices are reasonable, but we didn't enjoy our meal. We wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"Finally, a great Chinese restaurant in the upper Eastside! We were really pleased with the dim sum, especially the pea shoot dumplings and HK shumai. The downside is that the cost was a bit high at eight dollars for four small dumplings, but overall it was an excellent meal. The service was great, with our first bite of soup dumplings arriving promptly.",1
First time here and I'm so glad we were able to sit without a long wait (we got here at opening - 11 am on a Thursday - and were seated right away). We weren't the first to arrive - there were quite a few groups waiting for the restaurant to open. Both food and service was excellent. We sat at an indoor booth. The interior gives warm and cozy vibes - this would make a great date night spot or a fun outing with friends since they have a good selection of specialty cocktails and options for pitchers. We ordered to share - forgot to take pics of the egg sandwich with Thai sausage. So good! Will come again to try more of their dishes but hopefully can find a time without a long wait.,0
"I absolutely love Ethiopian food, and this restaurant is my absolute favorite in New York City. Everything taste so flavorful and the service is spectacular! I order from here at least once a week because it's that great. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious Ethiopian meal.",1
"Came here for a private event in the back garden patio which was lovely! Firstly, the service was really excellent - the waiters were very attentive and made sure our glasses were full throughout the meal. Luckily we got to try many of the dishes from the Mediterranean menu. We started with a selection of mezze dips with a delicious freshly baked pita bread. The hummus was the standout here. We also tried the burrata which was served on a bed of beets. Very fresh and tasty. I was a little underwhelmed by the Israeli salad which was just chopped veggies. For the main course, we tried the morroccan fish (branzino), the lamb kebab halabi, and the chicken musakhan. The lamb kebab halabi was awesome!! The presentation was great - served in a fresh baked taboon bread with the lamb sausages kept warm inside. The meat was super flavorful and juicy. They had a few tasty desserts as well for a sweet finish. Overall, we had a really wonderful experience. Everyone was very welcoming and the food was aromatic and flavorful. Would definitely recommend!",0
"I visited the restaurant for a party of 10 and was very disappointed with the service. We had a reservation at 5:30, but ten minutes after our time, a waiter began asking when the entire party would arrive, as they had another reservation in two hours at 7:30...? We ordered a variety of kebabs for the entree, and it came with the three different kinds of rice. They put all the meat on one big plates and mixed all three rice dishes in another big plate. Needless to say it was difficult to pass around a heavy plate of meat around a large table of 9 people. We asked them to separate the rice because there were sweet, sour, and savory all in one dish, and some people don't like each type. They poured them from this large plate onto three different plates but the rice was mixed together regardless. The salmon kebab was over cooked, despite specific request to NOT overcook it. The waiter was defensive, talking back. I didn't appreciate the arrogant service.",1
"This 1 star is because they made my friends and I wait for over an hour for a table, then turned us away because one of us weren't 21. We weren't going to order alcohol nor were we going to be seated at the bar.I understand if this is the establishment's rule, but have a sign. Make it clear. ESPECIALLY if you're going to make people wait for an hour (we wanted 1 hour 15). Card us when we're putting our names down instead of after we wait for an hour, tell us it's 21+ only, put a ""everyone must be over 21"" sign up. This incident was so disrespectful, rude and unprofessional.",1
I had a great time at Horus Cafe! The service was great and the drinks were delicious. I especially loved the Lebanese beer. The small plates that came with the pita bread were also really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.,1
"I had a great experience at ""Him"" - the bar and the pop-up, ""Him."" I liked that the worker saw us come in and acknowledged us, but it was rude that he ignored us after that. The wait for our burgers was long, but it was worth it when they finally arrived. The Dry Aged Burger was so delicious - creamy and juicy, with the kimchi mayo and cheese melted on top. The Washugyu Double Cheezeeburger was also good, but I preferred the Dry Aged Burger. The only downside was that the meat was a bit salty and charred, which made it a bit dry and hard to eat. I'm excited to see ""Him"" open as a store soon!",1
"I live nearby and have been here 3 times (twice for brunch, once for dinner). The food is pretty tasty, but service needs improvement. For dinner, I highly recommend the cauliflower entree. For brunch, I love the avocado dosa, the roasted beets, and wild mushrooms with poached eggs. Getting to the service... everyone here is very nice but overall execution needs improvement. When I brought my husband here for his birthday dinner, they forgot to put a candle in his dessert (I had written this in the notes of the reservation and also called ahead to confirm). They were nice enough to comp us for the desserts. But come on.. this was a BASIC request that an abc restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter, should not have had difficultly to fulfill.",1
We found Gelso and Grand when we were walking thru Little Italy.  They had a short wait when we walked in so we wen to the bar. The drinks were nice. We were seated quicker than they had estimated. Our waiter was nice but a little slow with waters. We got 2 pastas and sampled on each Others. Both were tasty. I liked the pesto a little better as my cacio e Pepe had a little more pepper on it than I like. It was still good though. It seemed much more modern inside compared to a lot of the other restaurants that you walk by in little Italy. I'd eat here again if I was in the area.,0
"I believe this restaurant is only selling take out meats at the moment. I ordered the crispy roast pork ($11/lb) and half a duck ($13). The roast pork was delicious, lean with the skin still crispy, just as I like it. They probably has fattier cuts if you prefer that. The duck was also very good and not as oily as the ones from other places. They also sell whole roast pigs which are around 33lbs.",0
"Yum Yum Yum!! I've been dying to try this place as it is an UES staple.  Came here with a friend and truly enjoyed a lovely meal here. The restaurant itself is nice and eclectic with all their unique pig décor! Service was super friendly and I could see there were def regulars here, the way they interacted with the wait staff, which is always a great sign from a restaurant!As for the food, wonderfully flavored and plentiful. Poached Chicken with chili dressing - chicken was super tender. There were plenty of nuts and cucumbers covered in this mild chili dressing that was wonderfully seasoned from chilies, salt, sesame seeds and scallions. So good and a great dish to share.BBQ Spare ribs - this is a fan favorite of the restaurant. The ribs were fall off the bone, wonderfully dressed in that sticky Chinese BBQ sauce. A must get here. Hotpot fish with mixed vegetables - A great hot dish. The soup was super flavorful, great when paired with rice. It wasn't too spicy which I appreciated. There were plenty of fish pieces with bamboo, celery and cabbage. This dish could easily feed a family of four. Great as leftovers as well! So GOOOOODDDD!Overall, a wonderful meal at Pig Heaven. Love that they really embrace the name. You can taste the care and thought they put behind their dishes, executing it to ensure flavor and quality but not have it be oily.",0
"A big part of this place's mystique is just plain old hype - but it is a classic too I suppose. I've been to places that manage to preserve the old school steakhouse ambience better than Smith & Wollensky, but I can also conclusively say that you're going to get what you paid for there, and pay for it you will. If you're going to go though, then go expecting to spend a small fortune (figure on $150-200 per person if you're getting cocktails, appetizers, and wine, as a starting point.)This trip the high points were clams casino, great steaks of course, and creamed spinach which is amazing, and we got from hashbrowns that we didn't order because our server screwed up putting our order in. No issue there, he was great overall.The downside of the place is that they pack you in and it's loud as hell - you're not going to get the experience that some other classics deliver.",0
"No no no more like yes yes yes!!!! right now i am daydreaming of the tori tantan ramen that had the creamiest and most flavorful broth i've had in a long time! also, their yakitori set is an absolute must for an appetizer! really affordable, adorable atmosphere, and great service. MMMMM those noodles tho!!!!",0
"Moe's is a great fast food option. I typically come here when I'm heading to Long Island to attend court and/or meeting and just look for a quick bite on my train rideThe staff here is very quick-- they engage in personal conversation, but they keep the line moving, in an efficient manner. Sometimes the food area isn't the neatest, but I understand, they have customers in and out, they are moving at a rapid pace--it's not because they are just a messy/nasty establishment.I always get the Joey Bag O' Donuts, I believe formerly the had the Art Vandelay (Im an avid Seinfeld fan) so that always caught my eye. Anywho, the only other negative would probably be the nachos; they are slightly bland. However, they are free, so not much to complain about somethibg you're not even paying for. I would definitely say this is one of the greater food options in Penn Station; it's worth giving them a shot for a good quick meal, a decent price, and lastly, they move quick--you don want to be stuck on a long and slow moving line--and miss your train!",0
"Good option for a business lunch near the busy Bryant Park and Times Square. I went on a Friday at 1pm and the place was packed. Thankfully we had made a reservation and our table was waiting for us. We started with the chips and guacamole, which, differently from most other places, came with a lot of guacamole and a lot of chips. We ordered a salad, two tacos, and one of the burritos. Important to note that the burritos are about half of a normal sized burrito;hence the lower price tag of around $6-$7 each. The food came out within 15/20 minutes, hot and tasted good. The food definitely did not impress me, even though I certainly enjoyed it. I will consider Mexicue for other business lunches around the area due to the option to make a reservation and the decent quality of the food.",0
"My niece wanted pizza, but not from the pizza place we were standing at, she wanted pizza on 92nd street, in the rain, but the heart wants what the heart wants so we obviously ended up at an ice cream shop on the way to the pizza place and not the pizza place.  All that is to say I really wanted Chinese food and this place was next door.Now I think I ate here in probably 2002 when I lived in the city and it was trip down memory lane, in a good way. I got the chicken and peanuts, spicy, and it was huge. Like an immense portion that I ended up splitting with my brother, the father of my niece. She didn't want any because she doesn't like the spice, but I enjoyed my share while my brother walked for pizza, now requested, in the rain.Would go back.",0
"I frequent La Vela alot. It's close to my job so when I'm not in the mood to cook dinner, I stop by on my way home because it's usually quiet around 5ish/6.While they make a delicious pasta & clam dish, I only gave this spot three stars because it is overpriced. I spend an easy $50 on a glass of wine, one entree and tip. No dessert or apps included. If I didn't enjoy their one entree so much and the location wasn't convenient, I'd probably never go, tbh.",0
Came here for brunch b/c of the great reviews Pros:- The Eggs Benedict was delicious but portion size was a bit small. Wish there was more salad. - Great ambience to chat with friends Cons:- Waited almost two hours for a table of six - Space is very tight inside. Don't bring backpacks.,0
"Jungsik is a Michelin star restaurant that does their full set menu for outdoor dining which is remarkable. I came here over the weekend and it was amazing. Their seven course signature is currently: + Osetra Caviar + Octopus (fave #1) + Branzino + Tuna Kimbap (fave #2) + Galbi (fave #3) + Huckleberry + Baby Banana. Additionally, there is a cucumber miso cleanse (or something like it) as well as amuse bouche at the beginning plus petit fours at the end. It's a two star Michelin spot so naturally the food was divine. However, outdoor dining comes with its challenges. While the majority of the tables are under cabanas there are two two-top tables that are in the street and not as protected from the wind. Unfortunately, the evening we went it was a bit windy so we asked to be moved to a cabana once one opened up. The reason why I took off a star is because we had asked to be moved to a cabana very early on in our evening, and then a couple came 30 mins after us and got moved into a cabana before we did. Right in",1
"The Sports Bar at NYU is a great place to go with friends for a night of drinks and sports. The staff is friendly and the beer selection is decent. The TVs are always tuned to one of the many football or sports games being played, making it a great spot to watch the game. However, the noise level is quite high, making it difficult to hear your friends if they are speaking in a low voice. The bouncer was also quite annoying in the way he treated everyone, constantly telling them to ""move"" as they were waiting for an Uber. Overall, the Sports Bar at NYU is a great place to go for a night out with friends, but be aware that it can be quite loud.",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The drinks were refreshing and the food was delicious. Our favorite dish was the duck confit, which was full of flavor and not too salty. The service was excellent, and we would definitely come back.",1
"Pietro Nolita is definitely an Instagram-worthy restaurant! I went with my fiancé for our anniversary, and she loved the pink atmosphere. The restaurant has an outside dining area, but I didn't care for it because it didn't give me the pink ambiance I wanted. The restaurant is really small, with only one host and one bartender. Reservations must be made in advance, and there is a $35 cancellation fee if you cancel your reservation. They don't have a lot of food options, but what we ordered was good. My fiancée had the salmon with roasted vegetables, and I had the ""PINK AS FUCK"" pancakes with one egg. My egg was literally covered in oil, and it was so greasy. Our bill came up to $90, which was just an experience. However, the food options and price make this restaurant a good place for drinks only.",1
"Nonono, unfortunately, didn't quite hit the mark for me. While the yakitori was reasonably priced, the food was bland and lacked flavor. The spicy yakitori fared no better, with little spice to it. My friend's ramen, on the other hand, was much better. All in all, I wouldn't recommend Nonono based on my experience. There are much better yakitori places in the city.",1
"Quick service, really good dumplings albeit I didn't expect them sticky and steamed ....made for some sloppy chopstick handling.... Got the sampler-$13.50. Liked them all very much except for the pork and chive one...felt like potatoes inside ? Overall it Filled me up nice, probably could have shoved a few pork buns down as well but needed to run for the train. Was on a schedule and quite rushed. What a day !",0
"Westville West is a great spot for vegetarians in the city. They have a variety of options on the menu, and all the vegetables seem to be fresh and well seasoned. The market plate was my favorite, and I felt that all the vegetables were fresh and well balanced. The only downside was the veggie hot dog, which was definitely frozen and maybe I was expecting something more homemade or maybe Impossible ""meat."" But overall, the food was good and I would recommend this place to others.",1
"Overall, the food was decent, but it could have been more flavorful. The wings were especially good, but the spicy taste was the same as the mild. The mix and match sliders were also a hit, with a variety of flavors to choose from. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite crowded and we had to wait a bit for our table, which made the experience a bit less enjoyable.",1
"Best wontons? Yes. Noodles? Forgettable. 5/5 wontons: This is /the/ place to go to for wontons, and for good reason. Portions are huge, packed with pork and shrimp, and very flavorful. Did I mention it's also very affordable? You get 5 if you order it with the noodles and 8 a la carte. 3/5 noodle soup: I ordered the wonton noodle soup, which is where I was less impressed. The egg noodles were pretty flavorless and, because they use plastic utensils, their ""soup spoon"" made it difficult to scoop up any meaningful amount of broth to have with the noodles. 5/5 service: pretty solid service for a busy place. Efficient, fast, and kind.5/5 price*: for noodle soup, it's pretty cheap. $8.75 for just wonton noodle soup. If you want it with a protein (duck, pork), then it's ~$11. Still pretty fair if you're craving wonton noodle soup. I recommend the duck to add some more flavor to the broth, but this can be oily cause of the duck fat. The other menu items, however, were on the more expensive end for the area.",0
"I really enjoyed the food and ambiance at Thai market, but I was disappointed with the staff's treatment of me. I called ahead of time to check when the lunch special is until. They told me it's until 4:30 pm. I came at 4 pm to try their lunch special. I was told their store is closed from 4-5 pm. I was like, ""okay but I just called and checked and was told the lunch special is until 4:30 pm."" She said sorry but basically implied that I needed to leave. I just find it very disrespectful when businesses first lie to the customer by providing false information over the phone and then subsequently when they arbitrarily close down midday but do not put their correct hours on any of their sites (yelp, google etc.). I went to Thai market instead.",1
"I was really excited to try this restaurant, as it's in a really trendy Chelsea neighborhood. The food was okay, but the prices were high. I wasn't that impressed with the rolls we got either. The shakshuka dish was a decent size, but the sushi roll was really expensive and the sushi rice was already hard. I thought the pictures were really cute though.",1
"I had a great time at Field Good! The first time I went, I didn't know what to get, so I asked the nice girl at the counter. She gave me a big tray filled to the rim. I saw Boneless Chicken Breast, Sweet Potatoes Mash, Mac & Cheese, Brown Sugar Blondie, Quinoa, and Cucumber, and more stuff in the bottom of my tray for less than $18. They do have other combos and bowls for less that limited to two sides, etc. The chicken was the best part. It was a well-cooked chicken on the skin side and seasoned with to taste. I was thinking I had cornbread, but it was more like a brown brownie. Mac&Cheese needed a cheese that had a flavor. Sweet Potatoes where better than OK. I didn't finish it, but I am a Fried Chicken guy so I don't hold that against Field Good. This place will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The service was really good.",1
My brother bought it as takeout for my lunch and the taste was just mediocre. I ordered the Hawaiian classic (Tuna & Salmon) since it had everything I wanted. The serving size was filling for one even though it didn't look like a lot. There wasn't much of the Ponzu sauce spread over the bowl. Mostly concentrated in the middle and the rice was lumped together so it wasn't easy to mix everything either. Only the parts with the ponzu sauce had an Unami flavor.Filled me up for lunch but don't think I would get again.,0
"I was disappointed with my experience at Ruby Tuesday. The wings and drinks were good, but the portion size was small for the price. The lunch specials were not available when we visited, so it was a busy time square and they didn't have any specials. The salads that came with the fries were nice, but the portion size was small. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"Came here on Sunday around noon for lunch and was so happy with my experience here! when I got there, the line seemed kinda long (around 10 people in front of me), but moved fairly quickly. I'm not typically a seafood person so I was a little skeptical of if I would like this place, but I ended up really loving it!! I ordered the 3 hand rolls combo (salmon, scallops, crab). The combos are such a great deal and would recommend anyone try the combos, even if they think they wouldn't like something in the combo. I typically don't like scallops, but it was amazing in the handroll!! You place your orders and a waiter in front makes the rolls right in front of you and places it in front of you when it's done. Make sure to eat it right away to get the crispness of the seaweed for the longest time! The seaweed is so crispy and the rice and fish are all well seasoned that it becomes so great all together. At the end, you don't tip because service/tip is already included in the price! 3 handrolls for $13 is such a great deal and I would definitely recommend this place!",0
"During the Phase 2 opening of NYC, I decided to give outdoor dining a try and so I came to K'OOK for an excellent experience. They have revamped the outside to include outdoor seating with partitions and spaced tables. They even put out nice plants for you to look at and made it a real restaurant experience. The waitress was extremely nice and friendly and started me off with appetizers and drinks. The Pinot noir I got was very good. The appetizers were great as well, plus you can never complain about complimentary appetizers. I got the fried egg as an appetizer as well and it exceeded my expectations, and was priced very fair. It was covered in spicy mayo which I love, and the egg was cooked very well. For dinner I got a beef Bibibop, which came in a bowl with a side of rice for me to add in. Although I'm used to it already mixed in with the sauce, I liked that you can add your own sauce so you can measure for yourself how much you want. They did a great job of social distancing and re-opening the restaurant. I will sure be back, and plan to support small local East village restaurants like K'OOK.",0
"Not too shabby. Drinks were great. But what can I say? Californians (and most recently from San Diego) will always be a tough sell on Mexican food.Came for taco Tuesday- all tacos $4. They are a little bigger so I guess this is sort of deal although to me taco Tuesday is like $1.50-2.50 tacos but I guess #thisisnewyork. Tacos were not bad but nothing memorable. To me, in terms of ingredients tacos are not difficult so I expect a damn good taco at $4 a pop as a special. However I did like that you could get seafood tacos at this price too. The guac appetizer for the table is measly portion- get two if you have more than 2 people. Mainly we were bummed out at the mega slow service (the place was not busy by any means) and the lack of Happy Hour drink specials. They call their HH ""fiesta time"" and I think it's only Wed-Sat. Check their Instagram @ilovenyctacos for their specials. I believe they do have boozy brunch but my friend said it's subpar. So maybe keep this in your back pocket for a HH drink spot (but only on certain days!)",0
"I had a great time at this Mexican restaurant. The proximity to Hudson Yards was great, and the atmosphere was reallyDefinitely a great place to eat. The guac was amazing, and the prawns and rice were both delicious. However, I was a bit disappointed with the service. The server was rude, and didn't seem to care about making sure that I was happy. I didn't realize that I had ordered the wrong drink until after I had had a few sips, and then I told her. Instead of apologizing, she took the drink away and came back 15 minutes later with the correct drink. It was a bit frustrating, and I ended up leaving a lower tip because of it. Overall, though, I had a great experience at this restaurant.",1
"Prince Street Pizza is a must-go for anyone in the city looking for some of the best pizza around. The slices are large and delicious, and the prices are very reasonable. The only downside is that it can be quite busy, so be sure to arrive early if you want to snag a table. The service is fast and friendly, which is always a bonus.",1
"I really appreciate the distance seating during COVID It was not my intended place to have dinner but I liked the fact that it was a slow night and not busy, no hassle about reservations plus Mexican on a cold night wasn't such a bad idea We got straight to ordering. We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the plantain empanadas. It was more than enough food . The fajitas were excellent and I really liked the flavor of the shrimps. The empanada were different , I evie yes a crust filled wth plantains but it was more like plantains wth beans and cheese Nonetheless even though it was not what we envisioned it was good. The mango lemonade was on the sour side, thankfully we had water to add to it to water or down. I would return again , overall good service , food and price was good",0
"I had higher expectations for this place but it fell short in terms of ambience and food. It's more like 3.5 stars but will bump up if I have a better second experience. For brunch, I got the roasted fish (dorado) Japanese breakfast with a poached egg. It tasted fine overall but nothing amazing. I like the balance of protein, veggies and carbs. I actually enjoyed the salad and miso soup the most. The miso soup had some kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) which I've never seen at other places. What dampened my experience here was a number of things like first, the rice was served barely warm though it had these yummy seaweed flavoured toppings. It was also VERY LOUD. I'm not sure if the customers were louder because of the booming music or because of how packed this place was. There was just enough space between tables for people to walk single file through.The music was nice but they're blasting a pop mix which I felt contrasted to my food.I was expecting this place to be more chill but it had more of the loud bar vibes so now I have mixed feelings regarding the atmosphere here. The menu items are interesting though like the hotcakes and I would like to visit again to try it out.",0
"Went to Ai Fiori about a month ago.  It is located inside a hotel, up a nice, circular flight of stairs.  The restaurant is large, with plenty of rooms between tables.  Service was good but not noteworthy.They have the option of a tasting menu, prix fixe, or a la carte.  We opted for a la carte, as we were all not very hungry.I tried the following dishes:Polenta (crispy polenta, caponata, fennel, olives, basil) (3/5): I am a huge fan of polenta and tend to order it when it's on a menu.  This polenta was okay, but definitely not my favorite rendition.  The olive taste was overpowering, and it was a little soggy.  Overall an underwhelming dish.Uovo (slow-poached egg, purgatory sauce, straciatella cheese, tomato bread) (4/5): I enjoyed this dish.  The egg mixed with the red sauce went really well with the bread.  It was a really great dish to share.Funghi (hen of the woods mushrooms, ricotta salata) (4/5): The funghi was really simple and great.  Mushrooms topped with ricotta salata.  It was a nice sharing dish that was enjoyed by all of my dining mates.Tagliatelle with White Truffle (3.5/5): This was a good, but not great, pasta.  It was very creamy and cheesy in flavor, with a good amount of truffle.  The cheesy flavor was really overpowering, and the pasta was very heavy.  The portion was a good size.I had a good meal at Ai Fiori, but I wasn't blown away.  I will probably return again, but not for a while.",0
I really enjoyed my experience at Cho Dang Gol Korean Restaurant. The wait was minimal and the food was delicious. The kimchi tofu stew was especially delicious and filling. The service was excellent and our server was very attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Korean meal.,1
"I came to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed! We were put on a wait list and were called back about 20 minutes later. To be seated, the entire party needs to be present, so this place can get busy.

The interior of the restaurant is really cute and cozy. It was very warm and welcoming.

I ordered a chai latte and a cappuccino. Both drinks were really good! The chai latte was really strong, which I liked.

For our food, we ordered the bronte burger (with truffle fries) and the shrimp pasta. The bronte burger was really good! The burger was juicy and very tasty. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly. The shrimp pasta was also really good! The sauce was creamy with a hint of lemon and there were a lot of shrimp in the dish. We both loved it.

We also really loved the crispy brussel sprouts! It's best to eat them when they first come out, but after a while they get a little soggy because there's sauce in the brussel sprouts dish.

Overall, we had a great brunch at this restaurant on a nice October Saturday.",1
"I would recommend this restaurant for the dueling pianos. The hosts did a great job keeping the crowd engaged and had great renditions of a few really random songs. The food was not very good, but the dueling pianos were great.",1
This was a nice place for a large group to meet up and catch up. They have indoor and outdoor seating.  The wait staff was polite and attentive.  They did not mind the group staying there for more than an hour or two.  Close to public transportation and easy to get to.  Many vegetarian selections.  A good variety of appetizers to share.,0
"Hanok is one of the restaurants at the cafeteria in Koreatown. Their food is mediocre, and nothing really impressive. And for the price, their servings are not that generous. Prolly cuz I'm too used to Queens. The staff are nice tho, so I should give it to them. It was pretty quick. Was my second time here, so I figured I might give it another shot in case they improved but NO. That was it for me.",1
"Bangus Sisig is my favorite out of the dishes we ordered. The next time I come, I'd only order the sizzling plates. It was seasoned well, and its texture was similar to that of meat, so I double-checked the menu. The garlic rice was also good, but palabok and a marinated fruit dish weren't for me. The flakes on palabok were crispy and the rice noodles went well with the sauce. I think maybe it would've been better to have it in summer with cold beer. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere chill. You have to order at the front counter, but the waitress brings the food to the table, and you pay at the counter when you are done (they don't bring the check to you). Overall, I would revisit for bangus sisig or to try any other sizzling dish.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! They have a variety of options for hot pot, Korean BBQ and both. I really loved that they had individual burners so you didn't have to reach over. The meat selection was kind of slim, but I was happy with what I got. The broth was pretty standard, but it hit the spot. Overall, I thought it was a little pricey, but it was definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and easy meal!",1
"The staff are so, so friendly. Great people, really. The decor is sort of gaudy? It's a bit strange, funky. But I dug it. A little quirky.Good variety on the menu - a bunch of different pastas, main dishes, and an entire pizza menu on the back. My duck ragu pasta was good, but honestly I couldn't tell you if it was duck or not - that's ragu for you, I suppose.The dishes were sizable. Minus the Eggplant Parmesan - small, but quite good. A somewhat different take on the dish from what we normally have.The waiters were all so friendly and attentive. I got very good vibes from this place, but the prices were steep (should come as no surprise, it's right in front of you). I would come back, but only if I'm somehow not feeling ambitious enough to try a new Italian restaurant.",0
"Disclaimer: I used mealpal for this lunch item.  Each place provides one item for lunch which you order your meal in advance.  This is not an endorsement of mealpal.  I wanted to try a different place so I picked Zoku Sushi.  This was located inside Jung Lee Furniture Store immediately on the left side. It had a very minimal setup.  I only saw rows of bowls to be picked up and 4 containers though not sure what they contains in the refrigerator.  The bowls were most likely the mealpal lunch item, Icelandic Char Bowl.  The bowl contained Icelandic Char, seaweeds, cucumbers and seasoned rice.I have forgotten how fresh Icelandic Char can be.  The seaweeds are potent and cucumber are a nice balanced along with the Japanese rice which was seasoned well.I didn't see a menu that contains the prices.  You have to try the fish!",0
"Came right after their happy hour for dinner, pretty busy for a Tuesday night, definitely will be back for happy hour next time!Started with an order or snow crab legs, 6 grilled oysters and fried feta. Our starters were all amazing. The oysters tasted fresh  and the kimchi herb butter it comes with paired well. The crab also tasted fresh. Think about the fried feta like a feta version of fried mozzarella that comes with a generous portion of tzaziki. I loved this! Definitely a great starter for people who enjoy feta. The grilled oyster came with a side of bread that I dipped in feta, definitely hit the spot. I got the wagyu burger with paprika fries and a side salad and my boyfriend got the lobster roll with pesto fries and a side salad. The fries were skinny fries and seasoned very well. Enjoyed the vinaigrette on the salad as well, had a pretty sweet subtle taste to it. I did ask for my burger to be medium rare... not sure if it was a miscommunication but my burger came out pretty well done.. so much more on the dryer side. Only complaint really. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster roll. Our waiter was pretty attentive and came to check on us pretty often.",0
"I had a good meal at Ai Fiori, but I wasn't blown away. 

I will probably return again, but not for a while.",1
"I absolutely love The Keg! The food is always great, and the prices can't be beat. The breakfast to go specials are especially convenient, and the 24/7 factor really makes it a great place to visit. I especially love their rotating seasonal pierogies - they're a huge hit in my book!",1
"The food was fresh and reasonably priced. The wraps were a bit greasy, though, so be prepared to bring your own napkins. The lassi is also a bit on the pricey side, but it's worth it if you're looking for a refreshing drink. The only downside is that they don't seem to have a lot of seating, so be prepared to move if you want to get a spot.",1
"So I see some negative reviews, this is a place that you stick to the basics and you'll be great. The burger I ordered was good and the app pretezel was outstanding. They have a good selection of beer and a full bar.  The Burger was nice for the $14 bucks in NYC just outside of Pershing Square. Now if your looking for a steak or something probably keep on moving, but my mate ordered the chicken pot pie and loved that too.  One thing to note that this is a noisy place at 5:30pm so if you want fast service and a quiet place to talk, this isn't the place.",0
"Had dinner here and was disappointed by the portion sizes, utter lack of flavor and price. We tried the criollo chicken ($20) and short rib special ($36). The short rib without the bones was probably about 5oz of meat, really not much at all. We ordered it medium, it came out well done, likely because it was so thin. The meat was 3 pieces of short rib about 7 inches long and thinner than a pencil. The dish also came with creamed spinach which tasted like spinach dip, a few tomatoes and onions. The meat tasted completely unseasoned, I couldn't even detect salt and pepper. The chicken is supposed to be a family recipe, but it too lacked any real flavor. The fries we got with the chicken were mushy and soft and they too didn't have any taste despite being advertised as provenzal. The service was fine as expected and the atmosphere is nice, but the food simply isn't worth it. I would not go back.",0
"I had a decent lunch at this restaurant. The yangzhou fried rice was good and the egg drop soup was pretty scary, but in a good way. The delivery person who ran away with our food was a bit of a pain, but the restaurant was good enough to expedite making the order when they were informed the food went missing. The food is not bad for its taste, but nothing stands out. All in all, it's a decent choice for lunch.",1
"Got the classic noodle dish! Was delicious and I was surprised by the favor of the broth.  ""Red Cooked"" Beef Noodle Soup is a classic and can be made a lot of ways, and I love how Ho Foods made it! It was so delicious and the beef was perfect! The thinner noodles were pretty good, I will come back to try the wider noodles!",0
"This spot came highly recommended by friends for years and I finally had the chance to check it out this past weekend. While the pasta was cooked perfectly, I do think the restaurant's fame may have gotten to its head. For the price, portions are minuscule and service is incredibly rushed. There are many superior Italian restaurants in the city worth a try.",0
"Delicious and nutritious, but also baked goods, so delicious and soul-satisfying.  That's by Chloe for ya' - it's a pick your kind of day for the menu options.  The case displays cupcake and cookies, so picking the right food can be devastatingly difficult because you want one of everything.This part of town isn't the most popular for vegan food, so it makes sense the by Chloe has its mix of healthful and generally appealing food rather than just the salad, juice and açaí bowls that might be the traditional ""vegan"" food by most people's mindsets.  They have smoothies.  They have salads.  They have sandwiches and cupcakes and cookies.  They have chia pudding and they have French ""fries.""  So, it is a good mix that happens to be all vegan.The best stuff here is the shiitake bacon on the Mac n cheese, the gluten free chocolate chip cookie and the gluten free chocolate cupcake.  After that, the rest is good, and flavorful and filling and hearty, and I would eat any of it, but I dream about the first three!Like many have said, the gripe here is when you order - you then wait for it near the counter.  This place is in a large space, so it's hard to hear from afar.  Then there's so many orders, it's hard to stand close by the counter.  So, yeah - be ready for that, and you're fine.  The food is worth the crazy wait.  If you don't want to deal with waiting, then just order cookie and cupcakes and grab items from the to-go cooler!  Then you'll be all good.  The staff at the registers were very nice and efficient.Again, there is so much space, and I am thankful that people are not standing and sitting atop of each other.  However, I do hope they put in some more tables to use the space.  With free wifi, people probably stay here a little longer than just the time needed to eat the food.Come for the food and get it to go!",0
"I had a chance to try Mamas Too pizzeria after seeing the hype on Instagram and a line of about 20 deep out the door. Fortunately, the line moved quickly and I was able to get my pizza about 5 minutes after I ordered. I had the vodka, pear and pepperoni squares during my first visit. Upon first glance, I noticed that the squares were noticeably blackened and charred. Not sure if this was done intentionally, but there were sure were a lot reviews concerning the burnt crusts on Yelp. I also couldn't sworn I tasted a little blood after trying to chew the hardened crust. I think everything would've tasted a lot better if the crust was softer and not as charred. I thought the vodka square was the best out of the 3 I had. The sauce was flavorful and the herbs definitely complemented everything deliciously. Second place goes to the pepperoni square. It's comparable to Prince Street Pizza's Spicy Spring, just a lot more charred. Last place goes to the pear. I thought this Square was pretty flavorless given that there was no tomato sauce. Overall, give Mamas Too a shot if you haven't already and/or if you're in the area. I can't say that they have the best pizza in",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The service was very friendly and helpful, and the food was great. I especially enjoyed the Phat Thai we had, which was very simple but delicious. The restaurant is much bigger than I expected, and I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the other dishes.",1
"Hou Yi Hot Pot is definitely pricier than the other AYCE hotpot spots in Chinatown; $34 per person (excluding tip and tax). The price includes AYCE hotpot, unlimited drinks and ice cream. They also have a pretty extensive menu. Ordering process was pretty simple, you get a menu with pictures of the items and you get to check off what you want to order.",0
"my friend brought me here after getting dinner together. there was a wait for the back part of the restaurant so we sat in the front part which was completely fine. we came here for the cocktails on tap which was a pretty cool idea and design (since you get to see them pour it right in front of you as it's the main prop as soon as you walk in). the mocktail reminded us of bubble tea- super yummy. we got 4 different drinks in total - i liked all of them besides the cranberry vodka one which was a bit too tart for me. otherwise, i highly recommend this place for the vibes and cocktails! definitely want to come back and try the chicken sandwiches next time haha",0
Very shocked how close the texture and taste of the vegan tuna. the dumplings we decent but the highlight was the vegan tuna. Spicy mang and the other roll we had were tasty and felt very healthy. The sesame cookie and green tea ice cream was larger than expected and I liked the subtle matcha flavor paired with the deep black sesame cookie. Service was fast and prompt.,0
"This place had been on my list forever so I was super excited to finally go. Once inside, I literally only wanted to leave. It was a complete disappointment. For one, the line was incredibly long as there was only one person working the front counter. There also appeared to only be one person in the kitchen. I can understand it but there really should be someone else. We ordered the ""Regs"" with the Nacho Queso sauce, Buffalo Nuggets with the ""OG ranch"" sauce; mozz nuggs with marinara, and the Crispy AF fries. The ONLY thing that was hot were the fries. The nuggets weren't very good by any means and for what it all came to (almost $30), I could have gone IN at Popeyes. This place is just a gimmick. People love nuggets and this is an easy ploy to get people in the door. Take your money elsewhere because this is going to be a letdown.",0
Was out shopping for a couple of things at TJ Maxx under the 59th Street bridge.  Was about 8 O'clock and was definitely time for some nourishment. Wanted something easy. Heard about Ritz Diner. Walked cross the street and saw it was not that crowded. Great for social distancing. They even had plexiglass between the booths. Great to reduce to the chances of C-19.  Waiter came over with menus. Asked about beverage choice. Stuck with water. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium deluxe. Food too a bit of time to come since there were many take out orders being lined up.  Service was standard and the food ok. Wasn't a fan of the red cabbage slaw. Go back? Perhaps. Definitely a good diner choice. Nothing fancy though.,0
"I stopped by Thursday Kitchen on a weekday evening and had no wait! The food was delicious and I would definitely recommend going in a larger group so you can try more food. The truffle mac & cheese was one of the best mac & cheese I've ever had and the kimchi paella was something I've never experienced before. The only con was that the shrimp wasn't peeled, but the other two dishes (duck empanadas & edamame dumplings) we got were good. The service was wonderful and they were pretty busy for a weekday.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant when it reopened indoor seating! The tables are far apart which is a bit of a novelty, but I didn't feel unsafe. The barcode to scan for the menu is a nice touch. I loved the oxtail croquettes - they were so crispy and savory. I also really enjoyed the chutney it came with. The black rice seafood paella was also delicious. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who visits!",1
"I stopped by Pho 99 for a quick meal and was not disappointed. The broth was solid and the meat was less thick than I would've liked, but the beef balls were a nice touch. The only downside was that they didn't include much basil or bean sprouts, which would've made the dish more flavorful. All in all, a cheap and satisfying meal.",1
"I'm so glad this place opened up in the neighborhood. I made a reservation over the phone since I was afraid the seating would be limited. The experience is very much like kazu nori. You can select sets or ala carte and the rolls are freshly made (they serve you one piece at a time).Space is spacious, but seating is limited with stools along a wraparound counter.  I ordered the smallest set and added some ala carte items. The ingredients were pretty quality and my favorite was definitely the crab. Will be returning to this neighborhood gem!",0
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The food was mediocre and the prices were high. I didn't enjoy the service either - it took a long time for our food to come and it was cold when it did. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Electric Lemon definitely deserves 5 stars for their customer service! I had a reservation and they were able to squeeze us in even later that night, which I really appreciated. The food was okay but the beet yogurt was really good! The oysters were eh, but the rest of the appetizers were decent. Overall, I'd say it's a decent restaurant with good service.",1
"I had a great time dining at Pecora Bianca at their Midtown location! The roasted cauliflower was my favorite dish - the stacked heads were cooked perfectly, with a creamy marscapone and raisins filling the center. The octopus was also excellent, with a salty and sour flavor from the pickled vegetables. The swordfish was also fantastic, with a slightly pink center that made it taste even more fresh. The only downside was that the pasta wasn't as al dente as I would have liked it to be, but the beef ragu sauce made up for it. The service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxing and inviting. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"Such a cute spot! I love Asian Fusion to begin with, and this place definitely does it right. The menu covers every Korean Fusion craving you could want. Service was mediocre and there's almost always a line, but the food is worth the wait! We ordered the Truffle Fries, Wings in garlic soy, Sashimi Salad, and Spicy Pork with a side of rice. I highly recommend the fries and wings - perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. The sashimi salad was mediocre, as it was a bit oily and not extremely refreshing like I'd expect. The spicy pork was good, but a bit overpriced. I felt like I could've gotten the same thing (or better) at a more traditional Korean restaurant. With that being said, I primarily came to Barn Joo for the fun, lively ambiance so I'm not complaining!Overall, a great place for dinner and drinks. Highly recommend!",0
"3.5 / 5.0 - Serra by Birreria is a beautifully decorated rooftop restaurant / bar on top of Eataly.I've had pasta and drinks here previously, which were great.This afternoon, they had the roof closed but it was not air conditioned and was extremely hot with just fans blowing around the hot air.My friend and I ordered dessert, which were quite small. Considering the price, I'd expected something larger or fancier, but the Pannacotta ($12+) was a nice dessert.I would recommend coming here when it's not too hot, so you can actually enjoy the lovely atmosphere.",0
"Had the Italian Thick hot chocolate and Banana Split Waffle. The hot chocolate is amazing, difficult for one person to finish based on how rich it is. The waffle has to be close to a 1500 cal dessert.  Recommend this place for dessert shared with someone else. We were upstairs and it is was loud, a young crowd (thurs @ 1100pm) and strangely smokey. The check in offer is lame, it's the sample they offer to everyone.We had a good time.",0
Stopped by for a Quick small bite and got the Shrimp toast based off of recommendations from fellow yelpers. This is similar to what you would get at a Cantonese dim sum establishment. The toast was crunchy. You bite down and you get a taste of shrimp paste made from minced shrimp and well seasoned sauce. Anything that is pan fried will taste better and this is no exception. Excellent appetizers so give it a go!,0
"We came for a quick snack and drink before our Broadway show. My espresso martini was good. We got the loaded fries - they were just kind of dry. Wish there was more sauce on it, or more toppings. Or toppings between layers of fries, etc.We asked for a variety of sauces to make up for it. Service was also slow - not sure if it's because we were seated in the corner, or what.",0
"Cousins Maine Lobster is a great spot for a quick lunch! The lobster role was delicious and full of lobster meat, and the bisque was delicious too. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was cute and cozy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I had a great experience at Vietnaam Restaurant. The service was excellent, and the food was fresh. My favorite dish was the pho soup - it was really flavorful. I also really enjoyed the red curries. The prices were standard for the UES, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I came to this restaurant on a Sunday and was told that the wait time would be 1 hour. We waited for an hour and a half and were then called at 3:30 pm. That's a 2 hour wait! I understand that there is a lot of people in line, but you can't tell your customers that the wait time is shorter and then go over by more than an hour. We need to be prepared for long wait times in the future. I'm not going to this restaurant again, but I am definitely looking forward to trying their food.",1
"The atmosphere was amazing - like walking into a time capsule from when I was a kid hanging out in the Bronx. The food was great, too - all of the pizzas were personal sized which was great for sharing. The Spicy, Margherita, Breakfast and Tres Golpe pizzas were among the crowd faves and we also saw a bodega sandwich made in the front. Everyone loved the food. I even got a birthday Nutella pizza for dessert which had bananas AND strawberries. It was awesome. Deadass.",1
"Overall, I had a decent experience at Stout. The food was hit or miss, but the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. The only real downside was that the fries were cold and the burger was a bit small, but overall it was a good spot to watch a game.",1
"We had a reservation for 6 here. The food was good and we ordered an assortment of items. I did think the waitress was really pushing to sell which I don't care for. She recommended a shared bowl of alcoholic drinks that is meant to serve many more people. She also suggested 2 items person at least. We were a small group and each got one item and this was enough to share. The plates were larger than expected. It is an Asian fusion restaurant. The decor was beautiful and there was indoor and outdoor seating. The tip was added on to the bill. I went to pay and waitress suggested adding on more tip which I declined. 27% tip would be far too generous when 20% is already a great tip. Again, food good just happened to have service we didn't love.",0
"Love the vibes! Drinks are fun although i was not lured in by the food. Will try next time.Great place for happy hour, dates, and late night sessions",0
"I absolutely loved Joe's Home of Soup Dumplings! It was a great recommendation and there wasn't a long wait when I visited on a Sunday evening. The soup dumplings were delicious and I especially loved the crab and pork version. The beef dish was also great, but it could have been a little less salty. The atmosphere was very spacious and large, making it great for groups. Overall, I highly recommend Joe's Home of Soup Dumplings!",1
"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant, but my experience was not at all great. My boyfriend and I had to wait a long time for our server to take our order, and when he did, they were out of crepes which was what we wanted. We ended up getting scones instead, but none of them really tasted that great to me. The ham and cheese one was really bland, and the chocolate chip butterscotch one was slightly more edible. The service was also really slow, and my boyfriend was served an expired beer. Lastly, I didn't appreciate that they only had tea kettles available to serve tea, but not cups like they should at a tea restaurant. Overall, I would give this restaurant a 2 star rating, but the service and the food could definitely use some improvement.",1
"I found this place through Tik Tok and it is just as good as how the video stated it would be. I went here on a rainy day in NY while I was famished....it was perfect. The soup can get a little spicy so I would recommend the mild if you are not a spice fan. It has the numbing seeds so pick wisely and beware. The place is nice and clean. There is an iPad to order and the soup comes in an individual pot so whoever you go with gets their own. Also, a sauce bar to make a sauce that fits your palate. There is tons of selection for your choice of meat and veggies. There is Wagyu pancakes which was muy delicioso! If you want dessert after you can get ice cream! It's free so that's the best part!",0
"We had the $55 tasting menu, plus drinks and tip it comes out to be about $82pp. Everything is shared including the entree so you will not have individual portions. For the marketed price at $55 you can't beat the food they serve.Of all the apps, my favorite was definitely the toro ssam bap. We didn't add the uni since it was a little pricey and would have been an overkill to the toro. For the truffle roasted mushroom which was also a favorite, they bought out a truffle box and will started shaving black truffle on top on it. You also get to sample 2 entrees (again you're sharing) with the prime rib and ramyun. By the time I got to the ramyun I was already full but the broth of the So Ramyun was delicious and I couldn't stop. I was glad we were sharing because i couldn't have finished that small bowl on my own. The So Ramyun comes with raw sliced meat so you have to push it into the broth to continue cooking, the broth was heavy, thick and creamy. We finished off with desserts, the only part of the meal you don't have to share. The lemon sorbet packs a real powerful punch so a little goes a long way. I'll be back to do this all over again.",0
"The restaurant was able to seat us quickly, and they provided sanitizer for the table. The menu has more than just ramen, and I got myself the normal chashu ramen. The chashu was cut oddly thick and was tough which was a little disappointment, but the broth was still very flavorful. The restaurant was able to keep us warm, and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.",1
I visited this restaurant for lunch and wasn't impressed. The chicken with broccoli was quite bland and the rice was oversalted. The experience was not enjoyable and I won't be back.,1
"The pizza looked just okay based on reviews and after ordering delivery it was just mediocre. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, eggplant pizza and cheese pizza. The mozzarella sticks were the best out of everything. They didn't come hot so I had to heat them in the oven for a bit, but if they were delivered hot they would be great. The pizzas tasted a lot like dominos. I wouldn't order the pizza again but I would order the mozzarella sticks.",0
"Keens Steakhouse is a great place to go for a nice steak dinner. The steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delicious. I didn't love the side options, but they were all fresh and good. Overall, a great experience.",1
"This place is great! I have been here a couple times, once in the summer when it was warmer and once in the winter. It has totally different vibes depending on the season. I love that even during the winter the rooftop allows for a nice view from the inside so you get to see the New York sky line without being cold. The drinks are good, their beer selection isn't super big but they have some decent ones, I wish they would have a wheat beer on tap but maybe they have one during a different time of the year. The small bites there are great! They are delicious and there is something for everyone, being vegetarian sometimes I am limited with small bites places but this one has veggie options!",0
"The food is still solid but the service at this location is pretty much non-existent.  Yes it does get busy but that is not an excuse for being rude to customers and pushing them aside versus saying a simple ""excuse me.""  The brisket tonight was a very dry cut despite asking for extra moist - which was quite disapointing although the one moist slice was great.  The new pork belly is also quite solid - juicy, flavorful, fatty, and tender.  Sigh - Oh Mighty Quinn's - you had me at hello - but the service definitely needs improvement.  I will still continue to order from here - just solely for delivery now.",0
"The pizza at this spot was delicious, but it was a little on the small side. The Margarita was great, and the fresh basil on top was a nice touch. The only downside was that the Margarita didn't come with a sesame seed crust, which was a bit of a bummer. Overall, though, I'd recommend this spot for a delicious slice of pizza!",1
"I absolutely loved the vibes at this restaurant! The drinks were fun and the food didn't really lure me in, but I'm definitely willing to try it next time. The happy hour specials are great, and it's a great place to go for dates or late night sessions.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. My favorite dish was the pork belly, but the beef casserole was also very good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"Patsy's on Broadway is the perfect place to stop for a late afternoon bite when you're grabbing a show at Broadway theaters. The salads, appetizers and entrees are all delicious, and the service is always impeccable. I love that they ask for vaccination cards, as it makes me feel really safe dining here. The only downside is that I'm not sure I could ever tire of the restaurant's delicious food! Next time I'm in the area, I'll be sure to drop by Patsy's for a bite!",1
I had a delicious experience at this restaurant! I got the korean style fried chicken sandwich and it was super crispy and had a sweet and spicy sauce with aioli and pickles. The pickled radishes were a great palate cleanser for the flavor bomb of the sandwich. The only downside was that I didn't leave a tip because I'm used to ordering take out! I definitely plan on coming back and making it up to the waiter.,1
"The chicken chilaquiles at the brunch menu at this restaurant are definitely a great option - the flavor is really good and the speed of service is good for the busy brunch rush. However, I wasn't a huge fan of how the ""fried tortillas"" (aka chips) were played - they were laid under the chicken which made them super soggy. Overall, the flavor was good and I would definitely come back.",1
"I had a pretty confusing experience at this restaurant. I came here with my dining partner because I reeeeeaaallllyyy wanted pancakes and I'd read the avians had good ones. The staff was fairly nice and accommodating. We were seated right away and given time to pick what we wanted. I originally asked for banana and chocolate chip pancakes. A couple minutes later I was told they had no bananas so I asked for chocolate chip and marshmallow pancakes. My dining partner asked for chocolate chip pancakes. We also ordered the chicken tender appetizer. Instead of chocolate chip and marshmallow pancakes, I received chocolate chip and *graham cracker* pancakes. So strange. They were alright. A bit dry because of the lack of marshmallow Instead of chocolate chip pancakes, my dining partner got chocolate chip and walnut pancakes. Even more strange. The chicken tenders were groundbreaking, though. Truly the perfect amount of crunch and tenderness. The honey mustard was fantastic and overall the highlight of the meal. Not sure if I'd return for the service, but I'd return for the tenders.",1
"Vezzo is a fantastic Italian restaurant in Murray Hill with great food, a casual yet elevated atmosphere, and no reservations. The quinoa and avocado salad is a must-try, and the pappardelle al funghi is also superb. The pizza is also incredibly delicious and big enough to share. Overall, Vezzo is a great choice for a date night or for a casual night out with friends.",1
"A few years ago, this place had great food and great drinks. Now everything is so very mediocre. The margaritas are become horrendous, the food lacks standards... no longer a fan of this place.",0
"I like that the restaurant is tucked away between two buildings, and you have to pass through a short paved trail before actually getting to the entrance. It reminds me very much of Kyoto. The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit and quite romantic, and has all of these bamboo accents. There's also a little garden in an interior courtyard you can look out at.They have a few different set menus at different price points. I had the Delight at $34. The food was rather mediocre and average. Nothing stood out to me, and it felt like very average quality food in a nice setting. Also, if you happen to be celiac, their sushi rice is seasoned with soy sauce, so you're out of luck. Despite calling in advance to make sure they could accommodate a celiac diner, we only learned in person that it basically means everything would be served sashimi-style. Which honestly isn't really a great accommodation.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The interior decoration is fascinating and the vibes is suitable for friends and dating. My and my friends' selections have: 1) yellowfin tuna tartare: The mango sorbet mixed with the avocado and tuna, fresh and delicious! Recommended! 2) crab salad on the avocado toast: Fresh, but not too exciting! 3) steak skirt: the meat is thin but enough for me. The meat is flavored and very delicious! The source on the plate is ok but I ate the steak alone. 4) cream brûlée : the coconut was only on the top. I was not a big fan of coconut, but the eggs in it are soooo good! I will definitely reorder 5) chocolate covered strawberry: besides it is red, nothing to do with the strawberry. The cake and pistachio   cream in it make great! 6) we ordered sangria and frozen rose: both are not too strong alcohol, which are tasty for girls! I will definitely come back and try other seasonal menus!",1
"What an amazing find, this spot is a great place to satisfy all those empanada cravings. We were in the area, and craving for a snack decided to check this place out as we love empanadas. Ordered a couple of different flavors, everything was yummy but seafood and potato/ onion with sofrito stood up. Pick was easy and staff was super helpful. Will definitely be coming back here.FYI - Yelp check in gets 20% discount",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but it was very spicy. I would definitely come back, especially since the restaurant was larger than I thought it would be. I would recommend asking for your food to be marked down if you're ordering a lot.",1
"I ordered food from this restaurant and it was excellent! The vegetarian rolls (rice paper steamed ones) were dry, unflavored and totally passable, which is why they lose a star. However the red curry OMG was fantastic - it was a generous portion with a lot of veggies. That with the rice felt so hearty! I'll definitely be eating from here again!",1
"The food was decent, but I was a bit disappointed that my chicken tikka Masala didn't have much chicken in it. It was just chicken and sauce, so it wasn't really worth the price. I'd recommend trying some other restaurants before returning to this one.",1
"This is a tough one, because our food when we finally sat down and ate was delicious.... but...I know we didn't make a reservation on a Saturday night in New York, what were we thinking? We could just walk in at 7 and be seated for 3? Well maybe, or the wait wouldn't we too to long. We stopped here first and they told us without a reservation 40 minutes. So we decided to walk further and see what else we could find. Of course this was ridiculous as we got into Korea town the restaurants were packed. So we headed back and the girls at the desk now said ""30 minutes, maybe less""!!! And took my phone number to text me when the table was available. Great. 30 minutes, another 15 minutes and my husband goes up to ask oh another 10 minutes . After one hour we were contemplating leaving, but starting over waiting didn't seem like a fun option. Again we go ask what's the deal. We are now told we are actually waiting on one particular table, and the people there have already paid but gave been chatting and on they're phones for 1/2hour.... oh geez.Finally these people leave and we are seated one hour and fifteen minutes later. Why they told us a half hour (or less) I do not know-poor judgement??? Ugh....But with that we ordered BiBimBop and a shrimp dumpling appetizer. I'm not sure if this usually happens , but all our food arrived together along with some delicious miso soup. It came out after ordering in about 10 minutes. I had the short rib beef, my cousin had chicken, husband had a spicy pork. Everyone was very happy and the Shrimp dumplings delicious... though darn it if I didn't drop my second one on the floor ... is bump it up another 1/2 star because the food was great and waitstaff were quick. But the front house you need some work, be honest about wait times. Oh and if you need people to ""move along"" bring the check. Just sayin'",0
"I dragged my friends to try this place with me because I've only heard good things. We weren't disappointed. When we arrived there was a line but it went by quick! They require you to show your ID and Covid-19 vaccine card (so make sure you bring that with you). As you're waiting in line, they hand you a paper where you place your order. They only serve Tonkotsu and veggie ramen so keep that in mind. They allow you to get extra noodles but not extra broth. I didn't order extra noodles and I thought everything was evenly distributed. I also ordered the Premium Yakibuta, (Sweet marinated pork slices served on the side) they were pretty good but I wouldn't order them again. Kind of pricey for the amount of slices they give you.The whole experience is really cool and fast. They sit you down in your own little eating area and next to you are other people but there is a small wall between you two. Sitting in front of you is a wall with a cut out where they bring you your food and drinks. The staff works fast and are friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone, to the people who are first timers of ramen and to people that already love ramen and know what they like. Solid place for sure.",0
"Overall, Macao Trading Co. is a great spot for a date night or night out with friends. The drinks are fantastic - there's a lot of tropical fruit in them and they're really interesting. The food is also really good - it has a strong Asian fusion bent, but it's in an okay-to-good way, not in a PF Chang way. The atmosphere is cool, and the service is slightly aloof but quite accommodating. The only downside is that the portions are small, so it's not really the best place to go for a big meal.",1
"I came here with high expectations both based on Yelp and by word of mouth. The 15 minute wait out the front looked promising as well. However after they brought out the square pepperoni pie, we were a bit disappointed.  Looking at the pictures, I feel that the number of pepperoni is one of the highlights of this place's pizza, it's what gives it a unique flavor and look. However if you look at the attached picture, you can count on your hands the number of pepperoni (~8 1/2). Most of the other pictures had upwards of 13+. On top of that, it is true that they took out the pizza straight from the counter and served directly, because the pizza was lukewarm. The texture of the bread (crispy bottom crust, and soft middle part), and the hearty and almost umami flavored tomato sauce was amazing and from that alone I can tell why there is so much hype about this pizza place, but it definitely was lacking in its full potential.",0
"Met up for lunch with old friends.  Walked in, got our temp checked, logged our contact info and got seated.  They gave us individual hotpot table, then we moved to one where we could do one large pot to share. QR Coded, reviewed the menu and went with the following:Broth - Spicy and pork boneItems - pork, beef, shrimp and variety of veggies I like that this place offers both hotpot and Kbbq under one roof... no more fighting on what to get lol!  Things that I liked:- Hotpot and kbbq under one roof- single or shared hotpot options- QR code for menu and order via your phone, each person can enter their own orders- price point - $25 per person- staff came by to remove the empty plates, fill up the water etc on a regular basis- sauce station in the backCons:- spicy broth was not spicy at all- Not as many selections as I expected - limited meat selections - they were slow to bring your orders after first order.  Had to wait 10 minutes to get our order of beef.Overall, I got what I needed - hotpot with tong ho, napa and beef.  I wish the spicy broth had more spicy to it.  Enjoyed the lunch and the conversation we had.",0
"Wine Dinner! $69 gets you an appetizer, main and dessert plus unlimited wines from Pasqua, Seeker, Guenoc and Antinori. We had prosecco, a sauvignon blanc and 2 kinds of reds.From the amuse bouche of watermelon with creme and basil, appetizers of yellowfin tuna and avocado, steak tartare and sweet corn agnolotti (with white truffles), main courses of grilled branzino and scallops (no one in our party of 6 was interested in red meat) to dessert, all dishes were delicious, well executed and presented beautifully.The restaurant is gorgeous, service very professional and prices reasonable (if you drink a lot of wine).Good for a special dinner out - but take Uber for the ride home after the unlimited wine.",0
"I absolutely loved my time at Ichiran Ramen! The noodles were perfection, and the toppings were spot on. The atmosphere was so nostalgic and familiar to me, and the location was perfect for us - right on a busy street. The only downside was that there wasn't any parking nearby, but we were able to easily bike there. Overall, a fantastic experience!",1
"This is a great Italian restaurant in the heart of the West Village. The menu is traditional, but not too adventurous, and the food is really solid. The green salad is perhaps the best I've ever had, and I can't think of a single thing I didn't like. The portion sizes are big enough to share as an appetizer and the pastas are definitely the thing to order here. I ordered the garganelli verde and it was really good - meaty and not too heavy. I had a bite of my friend's lamb agnolotti and it was a bit too rich for my taste, but the Parmesan veal was definitely a hit. There's ample outdoor and indoor seating, and the bar area is really cute.",1
Still great blackened fish tacos in lettuce leaves fresh squeezed juices all chopped up salad. You can even park right in front watch your car no ticket. Great prices.,0
"Barn Joo is a restaurant that I have enjoyed three times so far. The first time I had dishes that were great (including a tofu bibimbap and fries – japchae was eh). The second time was not so great, but they redeemed themselves on my third visit by providing vegan and non-vegan options and an online wait list, which I have never had to wait long for. The dish that was not so great was when they put an egg in my bibimbap after I requested it be vegan. However, they redeemed themselves once again by providing free fries that were kind of burnt and very oily (the first time I got them they were good though). The dish that was great was when they finally brought out the bibimbap again, the rice wasn't crispy at all – this was greatly disappointing. However, other than the above, I like this place and will continue coming back.",1
"Good enough to Eat definitely lives up to its name- it's a fun brunch place on the UWS that always draws crowds during the weekends. 

Albeit I would definitely opt for places like Jacob's Pickles or it's sister restaurant Maison Pickle when I'm in the UWS for brunch, I wouldn't oppose returning here either. 

My friend and I both ordered the Migas Omelette- scrambled eggs with the works; bell pepper, cheese, sour cream, etc. 

The tortilla chips were a bit soggy but rather than that this was a standard brunch meal. 

The only and unfortunately one of the main off putting things about the meal was that the salsa was completely flavorless as were any condiments that were given minus the cholula hot sauce. 

However, despite this, I would still return, as the meal was good enough.",1
"Love love love this place!Good are all delicious and reasonable price. All waiters/waitress are friendly and helpful. Have been here for few times with family and friends, everybody likes it.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the clean environment and friendly staff at this restaurant in Chinatown. Our servers were very friendly with a smile, and the atmosphere was surprisingly calming and quiet. My pho veggie soup was average, but my boyfriend is still dreaming about the beef at this spot, one of his favorite Vietnamese spots he's been to. I also love the casual, nice ambiance the space has. Very calming and quiet.",1
"Dessert @ Bluebird LondonAfter our brunch @ Le Grande Boucherie, we walked along the 8th Ave, towards the Central Park.Browsing, walking around the Whole Foods @ Columbis Circle, we landed on the 3rd fl. Cafe - Bluebird London.We had dessert only, so this experience is strictly limited to dessert menu.The staff was amazingly attentive, probably he was the manager with glasses, and what an immaculate service.Peach crumble ($12)Sticky toffee pudding ($16)Both were way too sweet for us. We should have gone to our usual place- Lady M right by the Bryant Park.Peach crumble had Peach slices layered at the bottom, with crumbled evenly thickly coated. Too crunchy. Sticky toffee pudding- we were too focused on the ""pudding"" and imagined it to be soft texture. Bou were we wrong ^^ Thick, chewy texture.The place on a Sunday after 2pm wasquiet. Many were sitting for meals by the window facing the Central Park, so our lounge area was very quiet. Stayed until their official break time, with music off, and thankfully, they allowed us to stay on. Lovely staff & fabulous service.",0
"While the wait time was a bit long, I thought the food was pretty good. Bruschetta was especially fresh and the beet root ravioli was a nice change of pace. I'm not sure I'd specifically return to this restaurant, but it's worth checking out if you're looking for Italian food.",1
"Overall, I wasn't thrilled with my experience at this restaurant. I was charged $36 for a double on the rocks of Angel's Envy whiskey, and at the same meal I tried informing the server that the mussels tasted a bit off (like sour/spoiled). However, because the busser had already removed the plate of barely eaten mussels, she disregarded my complaint and did nothing to rectify my subpar dining experience. The salad also was sitting in a pile of liquid, as if it had been pre-made and was sitting in the fridge decomposing for hours - would recommend putting the dressing on the side.

As for the customer service, I was especially disappointed. Dyckman Run Club on Thursday evenings that have utterly no regard for the neighborhood residents (setting off fireworks until 11PM or later, blocking the entire sidewalk at Thayer and Broadway), and poor customer service make it difficult for me to want to support this local business.",1
"Overall, I was not impressed by the food at this restaurant. The XLB (soup dumplings) are the only dish that I can really recommend, but even those are not great. The shrimp dumplings are also good but not great, and the dim sum was subpar. The lo mein was better than the dim sum, but the shrimp didn't taste very fresh. Overall, I would say that this place is alright to come if you want to eat in Chinatown, but I would not say it's any of the best food I've had in the area. There is a 3% credit card fee that is also not very appealing.",1
I had a really bad experience at Viand. Our waitress was rude to us from the moment we sat down and gave me a difficult time when I asked for a new glass for water because mine had leftover lipstick on it. My girlfriend's pancakes were burned and the waitress was reluctant to replace them. My french toast was decent but nothing special. The nail in the coffin for me was having my card run at the table and then the waitress hovered over us while we tipped which I thought was unprofessional and not good service. I won't be coming back to Viand.,1
"I've had a really bad experience at this restaurant. Twice, I've had orders forgotten and it's been over two years now. The food isn't worth the aggravation, and the new Wong and Wu's Wonton King restaurants are much better.",1
I really loved this rice dish with chicken. They serve it with three delicious sauces. The cilantro sauce was really really tasty!!And a delicious cup of wintermelon soup. All for under $10It's located in the new Essex Market. I will return for sure. They also serve wings!,0
"I was really disappointed with this new restaurant near work. The chicken ricotta and buffalo chicken slice I ordered tasted like cardboard and the cheese on top was all dried up and not stringy at all. The workers handling the food were all wearing masks, but the cashier was not. I don't think I'll be back since Pizza Park and Famous Famiglia are a block away.",1
"I had a great time at Restaurant Dig Inn pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the marinara sauce was really delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. The only downside was that there was not a lot of foot traffic so it was a bit difficult to get service, but otherwise it was a great experience.",1
Stopped by for a round of shots on a Saturday night. The hostess accommodated our party of 6 at the bar and a sister even brought additional chairs for us. The bartender at the bar was extremely nice and friendly we ordered 2 rounds of tequila shots and the bartender gave us 1 round free!,0
"This restaurant was definitely busy when we walked by, but the waiter was very nice and seated us within 2 minutes. The food was delicious and our bill was reasonable. Bridgette enjoyed her Chicken Pot Pie and I enjoyed my sausage & cheese pizza with BBQ chicken slider. We both enjoyed our experience and would definitely visit this restaurant again.",1
"Came here for drinks after eating at pulqueria. The bar downstairs was crowded and probably skewed mid to early 20s. We stayed for a drink or two and then decided to leave. I've heard good things about eating here and would love to try that sometime. This entire street is a lot of fun, worth coming here partly to walk around Doyers (although it's a bit creepy so better for a group of friends than a first date)",0
"Over the years, their dumpling had changed and I recently got dumpling soup. Their dumpling was so thick greasy and doughy. It has changed so much that I do not think I will go again. Also, the place needs do some renovation. It felt very old and dirty. I think the good part about it is the cheap price.",0
Was in the area doing a little shopping this looks like a cute place to have lunch my friend did some research and thought the food choices were good for us we had the quinoa salad which was very good enjoyed aside of the grill   Hulouim   cheese ( one of my favorite and hard to fine on menu  delicious ) yogurt and granola bowl very good both large portions I ordered a cappuccino but they had no sweetener except for sugar which I was very surprised at so I had to send back the cappuccino since I don't use sugar cute  inside and outside patio  another interesting thing is a couple sat next to us with two dogs inside waiter brought water for dogs so I guess this is something they allow. But really don't you think they could sit outside with those dogs I was not happy about that The tables were very close together !!service was good enough ( with shortage of staff it must be very difficult for most of these restaurants to give excellent service ) If you in area it worth a stop,0
"I was really surprised that this restaurant only has 3.5 stars - the food was excellent. We shared the mezze, the salad, a few appetizers and three fish dishes, and everything was amazing. The cheesecake is to die for, and I will definitely be back.",1
"The original Joju location in Elmhurst was on my list forever but as Queens is a trek for me, the new Midtown location has been way more convenient. I have had the classic Sweet Joju (pâté, ham, caramel pork) and the beef bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated ribeye, kimchi) banh mis and while I really enjoyed them, I still think there are some minor improvements to be made. For one, the pickled carrots and daikon lack acid-- they're much too mild and sweet. The lightly toasted baguette, while dependable, lacks the airiness and crispiness that defines an exceptional banh mi. Overall, some solid sandwiches in the area. I would recommend getting spicy mayo and jalapeños added to your sandwich for some smoky, spicy, creaminess. The aji verde is also fantastic but doesn't travel well; get it on the side if possible.",1
"Came to the Expat on a Friday night for their summer happy hour (4:30-6:30 daily) and had the best time! We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. The kumquat spritz was amazing and at only $5, a great deal too. Loved that they used metal straws instead of nasty paper ones. We also ordered a $5 HH calamari appetizer which was pretty good. I liked that it was on skewers, but it was a tad doughy and I would have like a bit more crisp. Sauce, however, was amazing. When we arrived around 5:45 the space was a bit over half full, but by the time we left around 7 it was standing room only. Very fun decor and menu - already excited to go back and try more items!",0
"Nonono- the name is unfortunately quite fitting for the food.  Not that it was terrible, but it definitely missed the mark for me.  Albeit super reasonably priced, the yakitori was bland for me.  The spicy one lacked flavor as well which was upsetting.  My friend didn't seem to enjoy his ramen that much either.  All in all, wouldn't be returning as there are much better yakitori places in NYC.",0
"I visited 3 Times restaurant the next day and was impressed with the service. Paul remembered me and my order from the previous day and got it all prepared as soon as he could. The beef and broccoli was delicious, though still a bit expensive compared to your average Chinese takeout. Overall, I had a great experience at 3 Times and would definitely recommend it.",1
"This 1 star is because they made my friends and I wait for over an hour for a table, then turned us away because one of us weren't 21. We weren't going to order alcohol nor were we going to be seated at the bar.I understand if this is the establishment's rule, but have a sign. Make it clear. ESPECIALLY if you're going to make people wait for an hour (we wanted 1 hour 15). Card us when we're putting our names down instead of after we wait for an hour, tell us it's 21+ only, put a ""everyone must be over 21"" sign up. This incident was so disrespectful, rude and unprofessional.",0
"Zia Maria Chelsea is a great Italian restaurant in New York City. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. The only downside is that it can be quite crowded, so make a reservation if you can. The outdoor seating is a great option in summer.",1
"I was really disappointed with my lunch at this restaurant today. I ordered a veggie wrap without cheese and it was really poor. The wrap itself was soggy and the vegetables were dripping wet. It was a mess to eat. My friend also ordered a breakfast wrap and hers was also poor. The wrap was soggy and the egg was leaking out of it. It was a mess to eat. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Food: 4/5Stopped by for dinner and ordered the yum beef, the miang salmon and the crab curry dumpling. The yum beef (5/5) sounds and tastes just like it sounds, yum! It might be one of the best beef salads I've had so far! The beef was marinated perfectly and it was super tender/juicy. The miang salmon (4/5) was unique. It reminded me of a dyi summer roll. The salmon was fried just right and it came with a side of noodles, onions, ginger and two sauces. The dish overall was very refreshing and light.Everything on the menu is beautifully presented. They make food look like art. From the colors in ingredients to even the plates/cups, everything was aesthetically pleasing.Service: 5/5Valla Table just opened and their service was spectacular! Everyone was super attentive and accommodating.Ambiance: 5/5Super cute and romantic! They have a great outdoor space with an electric fire place and maybe 4-5 tables. Great vibes all around. They had the cutest Halloween decorations up.",0
"Overall, I had a positive experience at this restaurant. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was delicious. My only complaint is that the staff seemed to be stretched a bit thin, and one waiter was particularly busy and didn't have time to serve us very well.",1
"FOOD: Definitely the best ramen in America, HANDS DOWN! I've had my share of ramen spots, but this reminded me being back in Japan all over again. Every slurp and bite was just as eloquently beautiful to the taste buds as Shibuya. Since I live in Cali, I'm sure sad that I won't have ramen as good as this back home. Now, I have to fly to New York just to satisfy my ramen cravings.   CLASSIC TONKATSU - I ordered the classic tonkatsu with the recommended toppings set. This was the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I. We couldn't even order more noodles, because we were satiated. I ordered my broth rich with medium noodles. He ordered his soft with rich broth.   CHASHU DON - This don was different than other places I've tried, since the chashu definitely tasted more smoky. I honestly was already getting full off my bowl, but the don definitely refreshed my palate after each soupy bite.  MATCHA PUDDING - This was so simple yet so decadently delicious! You can definitely taste the matcha, and the creaminess feels like a nice hug in your mouth. Haha! My boyfriend enjoyed every bite even though we were full. AMBIANCE: Walking into the establishment, you are literally transported to Japan. I had really loved my time spent in Japan, and Ichiran felt very nostalgic and familiar to me. You walk in through a curtained corridor where you find individual stalls for each person. It's just a whole mood. I loved every moment of it!LOCATION: This spot sits on a busy street. I didn't notice any parking nearby, but I noticed many people either walk here, take a bike (like I did), or get dropped off. There's a Citi-Bike port not too far away, so biking from our hotel was a great option for us.",0
"First off, I think Lashevet is a beautiful and cozy restaurant with attentive service. However, I think there's work to be done. We started off with the dips and bread. I enjoyed the hummus which was on the thicker side compared to other restaurants. The bread was brushed with olive oil and light. Both complimented each other well. The tabouleh was fine-- I felt like I was eating mainly parsley. For our main dishes, I had the chicken kebab and rice. The chicken was, for lack of a better word, quite succulent. The rice with peas was pretty bland and required self salting. My partner got the salmon which was recommended by the staff. It was really fishy, with no acid to cut through. The center was also quite pink and squishy, a bit on the rarer side than I'd prefer. And the accompanying pepper puree sauce was so light, i couldnt really taste much of anything. Contrast that to the perfectly crisp and cooked cauliflower! In sum, cute date spot but the flavors need a bold boost!",0
"Stumbled upon this brunch place on a Saturday morning and got seated with little wait. Ordered an avocado toast which came with some pickled onions and a poached egg on top and a side salad and hashbrowns. The toast was good, but nothing to write home about. The ambience in the restaurant is very nice, but the prices seemed a little steep.",0
"Molly's Pub was a great place to relax and catch up with a high school friend. The tables are set far away from each other, which made for a more private conversation. The service was friendly and efficient, and I hope the pub is doing well. I'll be back next time I'm in New York.",1
"Ichiran Midtown is a great place to go for a quick meal. The line was about twenty minutes long when I arrived, but fortunately they close at 1:30am on weekends so it wasn't too bad. The server recommended I order the noodle refill when I'm halfway done with the original portion, and they weren't skimpy at all - in fact, I felt like the refill was more generous than the initial bowl! There is no soup refill, so be sure to save your breath until you get to the refill station. All in all, I had a great experience here and I'll definitely be back.",1
"Food 3.8/5, service wack. This was my first experience w Thai noodle soups so I don't have much to compare to. Ordered the khao soi and gauy tiew tom yum, they were both flavorful and good, although I wish the khao soi had more broth to it for some slurps slurps. Calamari was crunchy but lacked flavors in the batter. The place was super dimmed, for that intimate feels but the table near us had to use their phone flash to read the menu. Here's why it's a 2 stars: I had asked the server to pack the leftover portion of my soup but she either forgot since she was cleaning up other things on the table first before my bowl or simply didn't hear me. She put other used plate/utensils in my unfinished soup. Once I pointed out that I asked her to pack it, she tried to lift off the dirty plate so save it! Hello? Not gonna take it home now.. There were ways to compensate her actions but nothing was offered. So we paid the bills and left, so here we are with the sad review.The lady in the front didn't even greet us bye as we were leaving, sigh.",0
"Covid Times review. Weekend lunch experience.. there was a slight wait but I witnessed Server cleaning the table thoroughly before getting us seated. We sat outside at a seat identified by us, which was helpful.Service was prompt, server was upbeat and made recommendations. Food was flavorful, not authentic Mexican but good for mexican cravings. All ingredients tasted fresh and thoughtfully put together.Great drinks as always !!",0
My go to spot in Chinatown whenever I'm craving pho or Vietnamese food in general. I always get the pho which comes in a big bowl and I can never finish it. The price is good considering the portion they give!,0
"I visited this restaurant and it was pretty spacious and had a great view. The service was quick and the set-up was pretty similar to Kang ho dong with cooking service. My only gripe was that they stopped cooking our last meat too soon, so it was pretty raw inside. The decor is much nicer here, and service is fast, but I think the winner of flavors has to go to Kang ho dong. They were also pretty stingy with replacing the side dishes and lettuce. I think it was more or less the lack of workers. For the number of tables there were only like 2 or 3 servers. The servers always looked rushed. They have a vacuum over the grill, so you won't smell as much as you would do at jongro. Regarding pricing-its pretty expensive. I'd get one of their combo meals that come with 3 different types of meat and either kimchi stew or bean stew ~$90 for 3 people which isn't too terrible. One pro is that they take reservations which is worth it if you don't want to wait the 90 minutes to get a seat at jongro or Kang ho dong.",1
"I had a great time at this cute little restaurant! The tables are a little crammed together, but it's not too bad. The app and entree options were great, and the chicken was especially delicious. My only complaint was that the desserts weren't our favorite - they were a bit odd in flavor. But overall, I had a great time! The service was a bit slow, but overall it was a decent experience.",1
"Flavorful, authentic Peruvian cuisine! I came for dinner and ordered the Saltado ceviche. The first thing I noticed was that the sauce was quite flavorful, with fresh herbs and a bit of a spicy kick to it. The seafood was tasty and fresh, though not that plentiful (there was shrimp, octopus, mussels, clams, and squid). Minor note, but they really should peel the shrimp when it's in a dish like this for ease of eating, but lots of places don't do that, so they're not alone. There was what I think was a slice of sweet potato on the side, which was super tasty with a nice sweetness. The $22 price wasn't too bad considering the variety of seafood, though I noticed that some of the other dishes were a bit overpriced (like the $38 paella). I also got a sangria, which was nice and fruity and costs $10 for a glass.The restaurant has nice wood decor with photographs of Peru on the walls. There is also dimmed lighting, which adds to the ambiance. I also liked the music playlist, as it was a mix of music in both English and Spanish. The service speed was pretty quick and our waiter was friendly and attentive.Overall, Pio Pio is a great spot for quality Peruvian food with a nice atmosphere.",0
"I came for a Christmas Eve celebration. Great service and my group mostly loved their food. Octopus app: delicious! The octopus was cooked well and I loved it. Scallops app: delicious also! The scallops were cooked well to me. Foie gras and duck ravioli: I was super excited to try this as it's raved about and I love foie gras, but I wasn't blown away much to my dismay. It's very rich and smooth and had a decent foie gras flavor. I think the other reviews overhyped the dish for me that I left disappointed. Lemon dessert: this was so so so so so good! I wish I could have a bunch more! The cake was moist and zingy! The sorbet was mind blowing and so unbelievably strong and zesty. I would love a gallon of this! The prices are a wee bit high, which is expected for a lovely place such as this. I'd consider returning and trying different dishes...definitely not that ravioli though.",0
"I was really disappointed with the pizza at this restaurant. The sauce and crust were both bland and lacked flavor. The cheese and toppings were also not evenly spread out, so you got a bite of plain dough. Our pie wasn't even fully cooked, so some of the cheese wasn't melted. Overall, I would rate this restaurant 3 stars. However, the garlic parmesan honey wings were great. They were plump, juicy, and a nice blend of sweet, savory, and cheesy. I would recommend them, but I won't be returning for the pizza.",1
"I had a great time at Trattoria Bianca! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the food was really good. I especially loved the salmon dish - it was cooked exactly to my liking and tasted great. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. We arrived on time for our reservation, but people were lingering at the table we reserved and the staff had to ask them to leave. But then we were told that the table they told us was ours in fact was not. Mind you, it's cold outside while we continue to wait. We (a party of five) were seated 25 minutes past our reservation time. I have never encountered being seated late for a reservation. The restaurant's excuse was that they were overbooked.

Unacceptable. They should have called to say we needed to cancel. That would have saved us time, frustration, and we would have actually had a punctual dinner.

As certain standards of courtesy are expected of diners, the same is expected of waitstaff as a paying customer. We finally got seated, but of course the waitstaff was sluggish and clueless throughout our entire meal. Forgot about food allergies, continual lateness with serving our apps and main courses, blah x 3.

It's a shame because the food here is really good. But it's not worth trekking to for the subpar service.",1
"We are so lucky to have several good restaurants nearby that serve Indian cuisine.  Chose the nearest one for last night's takeout, and we enjoyed an excellent meal.  We've eaten inside in the past, so that was a sure bet anyway!Last night we called and walked over to pick up our dinner, still hot and fresh.  The $18. takeout or delivery special is a great deal - an appetizer and an entree, plus naan, raita, chutney, and condiments.  The portions are generous; I even had some of my bhindi masala for lunch today!  My husband ate all of his chana saag (except for the forkful I had to taste, excellent!).  The long grain basmati rice is still fluffy and fragrant and I'll be able to incorporate the bit of leftover rice into one of the coming week's dinners.Overall a very good meal and a very good deal!",0
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The octopus appetizer and the green tagliatelle with truffle cream were both amazing. The portions were big and the flavors were great. The only downside is that the place is a little small and tight, so it can get a bit uncomfortable when people are trying to get in and out of their seats. But the food more than makes up for it, and the prices are very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"I stopped in this place solely because I parked in front of and decided to grab a quick bite since I hadn't eaten dinner. I was skeptical at first, thinking the food might be super greasy- but it wasn't. The chicken was hot,  tasty and crispy and especially good paired with the white rice.They have indoor seating separated by what looks like clear shower curtain liners although the tables are not 6 feet apart. There are also two tables with chairs still outdoors, although the weather is pretty cold in NYC right now. Service was quick  (I was the only one ordering in person) and the transaction was seamless. All in all, I had a good experience. I can't say for sure whether I'll order Taiwanese fried chicken again since I eat fried food very sparingly, but maybe!",0
"So I really really really enjoy the esthetic of this place and the vibe here. Only mistake was bringing kids, well I should say brining MY kids lol we had to dance battle another family for a table because my kids couldn't reach the bar height tables. I got the pulpo, which was amazing, and the chicken paella (pass). My kids got pizza opps I'm sorry I mean cocas and that was really really good too. We were still hungry so we also got a steak sandwich which was just ok.to wash everything down we got a dozen churros which were just ehhh. Overall this place looks cool af but for me missed the mark on some of the food. Granted I didn't get everything but out of all the food I ordered the pulpo and the cocas were the only notable dishes. I would love to see more places like this pop up. Salud!",0
"I really liked the restaurant's appearance and ambience, but the pizza itself was not that good. It was pretty oily and it didn't have a lot of flavor. My friends and I shared four different pizzas and none of us were really that impressed.",1
"Dallas BBQ was an ok experience. The most memorable part of my trip was the mimosa cocktail I had. It was pretty big and got the job done, if you catch my drift. The food left much to be desired. The ribs were tender, yes, but the sauce tasted like something they order in bulk somewhere. There's nothing distinct or special about the flavor. The ribs don't seem to be smoked or roasted in any particular way. Same goes for the shrimp - plainly fried and no special house dipping sauce. My side salad was presented without the dressing I requested, and our server didn't come back so that I could ask. My cornbread was from a burnt batch, hard and dry. I'd come back for the drinks, which seem to be a specialty, but you can surely pass on the food here.",0
"- Same menu/food items as the other locations- There was a 30min wait when we came around 3pm on a weekend- We assumed we wouldn't need a reservation- So many tables were free but I guess they didn't have enough people staffed?- Service was poor- We got the happy hour set ($60) and the food took forever to come- Even the soup and salad wasn't ready for another 15-20min- You're better off going to the midtown east location- If you do end up at the restaurant, make sure you download their app so you can get points",0
"Absolutely perfect meal. Every element on every plate was perfect in execution. Miso Steak: Perfect smooth bite and savoriness. Seared Foie: Not quite as impressive a flavor as the foie terrine, but the execution was great. The smooth liver with the crisp edge and peach spread all came together in perfect balance. Sturgeon and Sauerkraut Tarte: This sounds odd, but it works. The light foam and caviar, the marine flavors, the subtle sauerkraut. The foie gras terrine was silky smooth and buttery in flavor. The bread was fluffy and buttery. And it's dipping sauce tasted like a high end ranch. My server suggested the French Meteor beer. It was the perfect selection. This meal was worth the $300. There are few places you will get a meal this interesting and well balanced with everything cooked perfectly.",0
"I had my birthday brunch here on (11/21/20) I made a reservation, when my party got there they were told that they didn't have my reservation but once that was fixed everythingwent smoothlyfor the most part. I wish I remembered the lady name at the door she was super sweet. We were taken up to the third floor. It was a cute space but the tables made us feel like we where in the cafeteria. The brunch menu was minimal ,Typical brunch food the lobster mac and cheese was good just super oily,The rum punch was strong and definitely had us feeling nice. We had a great time because it felt like partying pre-covid. The dj played a mix of everything which had my party singing the entire time plus they offered hookah. Whats a brunch party without hookah right. The reason I gave 3 star was because from the minute we sat the wait seem to have an attitude and was rushing us the entire time. So that made the experience less enjoyable because everytime we asked for something we was met with some kind of attitude which was uncalled for when we was just trying to have a good time. I would definitely give Sohopark a second just to see if my experience would be different with the wait staff.",0
"I stopped by Brunched over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I was in a party of 8 and we had made a reservation weeks prior. That being said, we were pretty disturbed that we had to wait until 40 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. Aside from that initial impression, the food was good. I ordered the Ricardo Special Breakfast and it certainly was special. All components of the plate were well seasoned, purposeful and harmonious. The skirt steak was especially delicious and in unison with the perfect amount of chorizo. The sides of rice and beans, sweet plantain, avocado and a fried egg were a perfect supporting cast. On another note, some friends ordered the chicken and pancakes and were disappointed by what resembled microwaveable pancakes that taste like chalk. Other than this, we had a grand time!",1
"Please don't think about coming here without making a reservationMy re4servation was at 4 on a Sunday afternoon, I did not eat until close to 6I do like the brunches are two courseIt is a very fun partyThe girl at the table next to me, her breast popped out. The establish ment gets an extra star for thatat $15 individual drinks are expensiveWear your Sundays best, the clientele go all out in the fashion department",0
"I came to this restaurant with a group of friends after work and had a great experience. The space can feel a bit cramped if you're with a larger party, but they have plenty of hangers around so you can hang your coats/bags. I ordered a Thai coffee for my drink and my friends and I shared the Grilled Chicken Satay and the Chicken Curry Puffs. Both dishes were really good and I would definitely recommend them! The sauce complimented the dishes well (same sauce though!), and for my entree, I chose the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles. It was perfect - not too dry and with a good amount of sauce. We also got the Sticky Rice (taro I believe) and it was okay. I think maybe the mango would've been better but it's a seasonal option. Overall, a great restaurant with great food.",1
"Gallow Green is a great place to come with family. The Scottish eggs were delicious, the cheese plate was great, and the fish and chips were perfect. The mashed peas were a bit of a letdown, but the pies were great. The steak was a bit overcooked, but overall it was a great meal. The drinks were also great, especially the whisky sour. I would definitely come back in the summer when it's not so cold to sit outside and enjoy the decor.",1
"I've been dying to try Via Carota for ages, ever since the NY Times published an article calling their green salad the best green salad in the world. Yes, I know that says something about my tastes and the things that bring me excitement and joy ... and yes, that includes green salads. However, you know when you build up something so much in your head that when you finally come across the real thing, you're a wee bit disappointed? (Much like that time I saw James Franco, back when he was doing his MFA at Columbia. Let's just say homeboy was looking a little rough.) The green salad came in this enormous pouf of butter lettuce, endive, watercress, smothered in this dressing. First bite was, well, underwhelming. Maybe the dressing needed a little more acidity or zing; I did see on the NYT article that they drizzle rather than dress the leaves. Agree with my friend that the salad got a lot better the more I ate it. The star of the meal was definitely the pappardelle with wild boar ragu. The pasta was the perfect level of al dente. Eat a bowl of this and you'll definitely feel nice and cozy under the heat lamps. Perfect fall/winter dish. Tbh, I don't really remember much of the desserts (except the crostata was just a tad dry, would've been great with classic vanilla ice cream), because I was trying hard to savor the taste of the pasta.",0
"The food was good, but the service was not great. I had to ask for water multiple times, and my salad arrived cold. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, but only if you're in the area and want to try something new.",1
"I'm an avid falafel eater, and the falafels here are my favorite!  I always opt for the harissa falafel, which IMO isn't too spicy, and I add shug (green spicy sauce), housemade pickles (definitely get these!), and spicy peppers.  The hot sauce and spicy peppers give the sandwich a great kick, and they're free addons! You just have to remember to ask for them at the register. I often cannot resist splurging on an order of their fries with saffron aioli.  The portion is large and definitely big enough to share. I may however be known for polishing off the order solo ;-)",0
"The atmosphere at this pizzeria was great - fun and inviting. The staff were working out the kinks on a few things, but it was still a fun place to be. I tried some new and innovative pizza here, and my favourite was the ""angry butcher"" with tons of different meats and hot honey. The drinks fridge had a variety of sodas, but some were a bit expensive. The pizzas here are definitely on the fancy side, with lots of different colas, sugar cane ginger, and other specialty drinks. For dessert, I had a pannezotti - a giant dough calzone filled with Nutella and then Nutella and cream on the top. It was hot and delicious, but I did feel a bit guilty afterwards. The manager said that they are opening the other side of the restaurant soon and they will have Italian deli meats and other items available there. You can eat at the restaurant in, or take your food to go.",1
"Picked up dinner on my way home for the first time from Cha Kee.  I read the great review in the NY Times.  The food was delicious!  It's much higher quality (and priced accordingly) than other restaurants nearby.  What I liked about the food is that it was at once familiar (Cantonese/Chinese) with surprising touches of flavor from Japan/SE Asia.I ordered the cucumber pickles, Macao curry chicken, branzino in banana leaf, Lobster uni fried rice, and happy Buddha delight.  The branzino was amazing- had so much flavor with shrimp paste and citrus flavors.  The fried rice had large chunks of lobster and pieces of Uni.  Full of umami flavors.The curry chicken had olives- with more Portuguese flavorings than an Indian or Japanese curry.   Much smokier and not as hot-spicy. I will definitely order again!  This is not food you can find anywhere else!",0
"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was great, and the service was good. However, I was not happy with the wait time. It was very long, and I felt like people were being prioritized over those who had actually reservations. I also felt like the steak was a bit overcooked for my taste. Overall, though, I would recommend it.",1
"I don't think I've ever had authentic XinJiang food, so I can't speak to the authenticity of this restaurant. However, my bf and I ordered the Beef Shumai, Big Plate Chicken, a kidney skewer (BBQ special), and a BeiBingYang (Beijing Orange Soda) and we were very satisfied. The beef shumai definitely exceeded my expectations. It was more like a soup dumpling with a thin wrap, but still the flavors were there and it was delicious. The big plate chicken was a little too salty for me, but I loved how well the chicken was cooked. The chicken to noodles ratio was fair too. I would love to come back to try their other dishes sometime.",0
"This place has my heart! I have been here few times, and it has always been a great experience.I would jump to give it 5 stars, but reducing one due to the latest experience. Service, ambience has been great all the times, unfortunately the food was not up to expectations in my last visit, could be the pandemic! I have eaten a lot of different things here throughout my visits. Some of their must have appetizers - House focaccia ( you will keep ordering this), taboon trio - goes perfect with the focaccia, baby gem salad, sambusakI like that they serve mezzes, as the focaccia and trio fills us up and mezzes can be the entree! I like the zucchini cake, crab shawarma, wild Mediterranean shrimp. In my recent most visit, we tried the potato gnocchi, Branzino and the beef burger. It was quite average to what I had expected. They have a cute outdoor patio area which was a great spot during covid summers! It is hard to get reservations here, so make sure to plan in advance. They have some good cocktails, one of my favorite is the gin cucumber drink!",0
"I visited the Fig & Olive restaurant on 12/8/2018 and was unfortunately disappointed. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and the service was pretty good too. However, the food was not. The menu is the same as the others, but it was served sloppily. For example, the app plates were dirty. It was painful to eat at this restaurant. I would not recommend it.",1
I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The food was unremarkable and the service was slow. I wasn't impressed at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1
"This is the first time we'd heard that there was a Mee Noodle in midtown, after being fans of the East Village location for years.   The web says they have dine-in and the weather was nice, so a walk up to Hell's Kitchen seemed like a good investment in dinner.What a payoff!  The food was great: General Tso's Tofu was nice and Spicy, not too sweet as many other places serve it.  The soup and wontons were also excellent.The service was fantastic and to top it off my fortune cookie was, appropriately, an inspiration!",0
"Meh had way better pizza and I'm not talking Italy and way way better service and I'm not talking NYC.  I had to ask for salt shaker, which we didn't have at our table.  Perhaps they assumed they thought their pizza didn't need flavor?  The pizza was so bland ..... I can count the number of times I've used a salt shaker on one hand....in ANY restaurant let alone an Italian one.Truly had better pizza at a pizza by the slice place and there are a ton of them in the city.This is only my opinion and reflects my experience at this restaurant but I wouldn't come back.  Oh and did I mention EVEN though they have the credit card acceptance emblem on the front door they neglect to tell you they add a 4% surcharge on credit card sales.  Saying if you pay cash they don't charge the 4%.  They are probably breaking their card acceptance agreement with the credit card companies.  They deserve a two star but I'm giving them one star because of their payment policy surcharge.",0
"The Goonmandu dumplings were pretty good - there was a decent amount of filling inside and it was mostly pork and chives. The Yukgaejang dumplings, on the other hand, were a bit more bland. They didn't have as much flavour as I was expecting, and I didn't really enjoy them. I would recommend ordering another side dish with it if you're looking to get full. The service here was pretty slow, but that didn't really bother me. All in all, I had a decent experience here.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is always great and the drinks are delicious. The only downside is that the food isn't great, but it's still good enough for me to return. I definitely recommend this place for a party!",1
"It was a sunny, but cold Saturday and a girl friend wanted to the crew to hang. A friend of ours is a regular at this place and lives a block away so we all decided to meet here. Note, this place does not take reservations. It is a first come first serve so if you have a large group like we did (7 ppl), have someone go and hold the table like we did. They have heating in their outdoor dining space, but it was not warm enough for me especially after drinking a boat load of icy cold bloody Mary's. I recommend bundling up!Having said that, the food, drinks, and staff are wonderful here, which explains why my friend is a regular here. The drinks are really strong and the staff is so friendly. I love my Flying Cock, which is a block away from here, but the staff can be a bit transactional. Here, everyone is just so friendly. It is like going over someone's home and just hanging out, but obviously there is a bill to pay at the end of the moment. Two thumbs up for this place and one of few, if not the only, places I would freeze my butt off dining and drinking outside.",0
"I give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars. The food was delicious, service was great, and the atmosphere was cozy and cute. The only downside was that it was very crowded and it took a long time for our food to come out, but overall I had a great time!",1
Consistent & fresh sushi delivery option! I had the sushi combo and shrimp Shumai. The combo comes with a soup. Everything was excellent. Would like to come in and dine in some time to get the full experience!Delivery was quick too.,0
"This restaurant is terrible. The food was terrible, and the service was terrible. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
"My friends and I were in NYC and they really wanted to go to Sushi on Jones (next door) since I don't eat raw I decided to eat next door (here). I came in around 530pm on a Sunday so there were some empty seats but I heard from another person next to me that it gets really packed and the wait can be long. I loved to see so many veggies on the menu as i haven't been eating enough veggies while on vacay. I got the market plate with all veggies and then a side of mac and cheese to get me through the rest of the day. The food came out really quick which I appreciated. The veggies were really flavorful, my favorite were the peas and the mushrooms. Mac and cheese was creamy and cooked perfectly. This was exactly the fuel i needed and the fiber i needed from this trip!P.s. their restroom is through the kitchen and it's very greasy on the floor. I slipped twice and i grabbed onto one of the cooks and I'm so glad he didn't get startled and throw an entire pan of hot food on me. It's definitely a hazard to have to walk through there so be careful or I rather hold it.",0
"Very solid Thai takeout. This place is super close to where I live so it's convenient to just go walk over and pick up my food, rather than pay for delivery. I've had the Thai green curry with chicken, and have also had the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) with chicken. The green curry was delicious! I ordered spice level medium, but unfortunately was given mild (mild was written on the top of the container). The flavors were still amazing and the portion sizes were decent for the price. The drunken noodles were great as well. I have also had the Thai tea from here and it was sooo yummy. There are several great Thai places in this area, which is a plus for me since I love Thai food, and Thai Market is definitely one of  them!",0
"I had a great time at Keens! The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and romantic. My husband especially loved the dessert - it had his name written on it in chocolate! The Mulled Wine was also really good - warm, flavorful, and subtly sweet. The Butter Lettuce House Salad was also a great choice - light and refreshing. The Thick Cut Bacon appetizer was huge and definitely enough to share. The Hash Brown was a bit bland, but the Porterhouse for Two was nicely done. The best part was the Keens' Coffee Cantata - their ice cream sundae was generous on the fudge and whipped cream. Overall, I highly recommend Keens!",1
"Overall, I was not impressed with the food at this restaurant. The peking duck was not crispy and just not as good as the other ones I've had before. The other items on the menu were also just mediocre and not authentic. For the price, the amount of food was ok, but the taste and quality of the food was not really worth it.",1
"While the service is a little on the slow side, this is place is a great bet for elevated bar food.   The atmosphere here is wonderful.  The asparagus flatbread is delightful and the roasted cauliflower dish is delicious as the sauce is quite flavorful.  The nachos were also very solid and tasted like a premium version of your standard bar nachos.   They have a good selection of beer on tap.",0
"The Hraime skillet and Ktzitzot pita were both good, but the tomato sauce could have been more flavorful. The pita on the side was cold. The Ktzitzot was moist and went well with tahini sauce. Overall, the food was good but not great. The service was okay, but the directions for bussing your own table were unclear and the music got very loud for a few songs and then quieted down again, which was disturbing.",1
"As a man from Oklahoma who married a Puerto Rican woman from the Bronx and who has traveled to Puerto Rico, I approve of this place. My wife rated the Morcilla 10/10. I wasn't a fan of the bacalaitos (my wife loved it) but we both agreed that the Alcapurias were A+. We bought Relleno de Papas but I'm too full to enjoy. The Mango tropical drink was pretty good too!I'm no pro so I can't leave any pro tips but I hear this is a great breakfast option as well.",0
"Growing up in Texas means that my journey to find good bbq in nyc is not an easy one. Decided to give Mighty Quinn's a try because of the hype and of course the brontosaurus rib.Between two people, we got a pound of the brisket, sausage, the brontosaurus rib, and a side of beans that had burnt ends in them. You could say we like our meat.The brisket was way too dry and not tender at all in my opinion. It was too bad because that's usually my favorite. The sausage was just okay. It had a different flavor than normal bbq smoked sausage. The rib was pretty good though. It was truly fall off the bone, loaded with fan, and very tender. It'll definitely weigh you down after eating. Beans were good as well. Still haven't found a bbq spot I'd really come back to, but this place is good enough for getting your fix.",0
"This is a really nice new big restaurant at a prime location on Broome St.The menu is very straightforward with some pastas, large protein plates, and some starters and salads. Everything is fine and tastes good, but nothing is particularly exciting or different.The tuna crostini is a great choice to start ($18 for 3 pieces, plus $3 for a little Uni on top). For the pastas, the Lumaconi Gigante ($24) was the best of the 3 we tried. This is a nice place for a date or drinks with the very nice atmosphere, but not necessarily a must try for the food.",0
"The first time I heard about Camellia was via a post on IG.  I kind of fell in love with a picture of their rainbow noodle ramen and knew that I needed to try them out.  I got the chance to do so yesterday. I ordered the Build Your Own Ramen ($16).  For this dish you can choose your noodles (original, matcha, butterfly pea flower, rainbow, etc.), soup flavor (tokatsu, miso, shoyu, tsukemen, etc.), protein (pork, chicken, shrimp or tofu) and toppings.  I got mine with Rainbow noodles, Tsukemen dipping broth, pork chasu and toppings of half boiled egg, baby bok choy, and bean sprouts.It's a very colorful dish and I just loved the presentation.  The best part is, their ramen is made with natural flavors and ingredients.  For the colorful rainbow noodles, they use butterfly pea flower, cuttle fish paste, beets, matcha and carrots.The noodles were perfectly cooked, the egg was delicious with a nice soft yolk and the pork chasu was super tender and had a nice smoky flavor. The Tsukemen dipping broth was a little too salty to sip as a broth but perfect for dipping. I also got an order of their pork belly bao ($4).  The baos comes with a piece of lettuce, spicy mayo, pickled mustard, and finely grounded peanuts. The ground peanuts were a nice touch of texture and the pork belly was melt-in-your mouth tender.  Absolutely delish!You get a free scoop of gelato with your meal or with Yelp check-in. Both ramen, teas and gelato are all made in house daily.   I ordered the Ferrero Rocher gelato and it was excellent!  Not overly sweet with a nice creamy texture.  Perfect way to end a ramen meal.Definitely will be coming back again!",0
"This is one of my go to spots for some authentic Chinese noodles soup, definitely a comfort food for me.Been here before couple times to dine in prior to COVID. Since COVID, I've ordered takeout from here a couple times. The takeout: packaging is always neatly in a bag with hot sauce, chopsticks, spoon. I really like that the noodle and the soup are packed separately so the noodles don't get soggy.The food: mixed beef noodle soup (9/10 for taste +1 for price) - The broth is AMAZING, it tastes like they definitely stewed some beef or some sort of meat in the stock because it's so savory. I tried the beef noodle soup this time because I usually get the beef noodle soup which is really tasty. The mixed noodle soup had beef, tripe, and omasa (the stomach). If you don't like beef parts I recommend getting just the beef noodle soup.- The noodle: you can either get hand pulled noodles (the thin ones) or you can get the knife cut noodles. Hand pulled noodles look kinda like spaghetti. I personally really like the knife cut noodles because they're so thick cut so it tastes extra chewy, I'm a big fan of the texture.The price is also great, $10-12 for a bowl of very quality noodles. HIGHLY recommend.",0
"Secchu Yokohama is a restaurant that I have been looking forward to trying for a while now. The new menu choices are perfect, and the tempura omasake is definitely the best I've had in New York City. Everything about this restaurant is perfect, and I highly recommend it.",1
"I had high hopes for Mint Kitchen, as the restaurant industry is booming with options for protein and veggie sides. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed with the meal. The prices were high for what I received, and the portions were small. The salmon was nicely prepared, but I couldn't justify the price tag given other options in the area. The restaurant itself was cozy and pretty, but the lack of hot sauce made it difficult to enjoy.",1
"Soju Haus is a typical Koreatown restaurant - small, cramped, and with terrible service. However, the food is actually pretty good, and the prices are reasonable. The only downside is that they only accept cash or American Express, which can be inconvenient if you don't have either of those cards.",1
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really inviting and the food was fantastic. I especially loved the fried fish and chips, which were cooked to perfection. The only downside is that the drink didn't quite mask the taste of the alcohol, which made it a bit more difficult to enjoy the meal. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"We used to love this place, but our recent experience was not up to par. The order was botched, and the food was bland. We won't be returning any time soon.",1
"Jin Ramen will definitely satisfy a ramen craving, but the ramen isn't out of this world. Came on a weekday night and luckily, it was not busy at all. The ambiance is nicely decorated with a rustic feel to it. I ordered the Kakuni Ramen and really enjoyed the Filipino style braised pork belly and toagarashi sprinkled poached egg. My friend ordered the Kuro Tonkatsu Ramen which was recommended by the waitress and I liked the flavors in that broth a lot more - it had black garlic oil which was delicious. We also ordered the chicken wings which were nice and juicy. They have a very long extensive menu which can be very accommodating.Portion sizes are good, food came out pretty quickly, staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable for NYC ramen. I'd come back :)",0
"My go-to spot for pizza. Their cauliflower pizza is DELICIOUS - can't even tell it's cauliflower. Definitely on the $$ side for pizza but worth treating yourself every once in a while for a ""healthier option"". Their chicken parm roll is also great - always hot and fresh. The service can be slow at times but would recommend Marinara Pizza UWS!",0
"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The food was okay, but I didn't enjoy the experience. The waitstaff was nice, but some of them were very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Did the Saturday brunch experience here with a group of out of town girls. Loved how there were bottomless options other than mimosas - there was $27 bottomless for either mimosas, original margarita, or Smokey spicy margarita, which is the one I ordered and it was delicious and strong. However, the food was just OK - ordered the pulpo sandwich it was a little overcooked along with the pork belly. Also people get seriously drunk here and someone threw up in the bathroom; no one cleaned it. But overall still a fun time.",0
"Pretty cool Pasta place situated in the West Village.  Also looks a lot nicer during the daytime according to the photos.  The 2nd floor looks very homely from what I saw.  Came here for my birthday dinner with the family on Sunday night.  Got here early enough and they were able to push us up a half hour early.We ordered several things - both in family style and in individual portions. We started with the Burrata family style.  We ordered the four cheese ravioli in Arrabiata sauce - family style.  We then ordered the Farfalle in alla vodka sauce and the spaghetti in the roasted garlic pecorino sauce in individual portions.    First, the service was pretty damn attentive, especially on Sunday.  Our waiter was very prompt and hospitable.  Second, the breadsticks were awesome - nice and soft.  As for the food, it was pretty damn good.  As you can tell, the pasta is all fresh and seems like it's made to order.  You can see the cooks creating the pasta while you're eating.  They have the special contraptions that they use to create the pasta.  All of our main courses tasted great.  The portions were very plentiful that we ended up having some leftovers as well.  We finished our meal with the tiramisu and that was also great.I'd highly recommend the restaurant for some authentic and fresh pastas.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The Morcilla was excellent, and my wife rated the Bacalaitos a 9/10. The Alcapurias were also very good. I wasn't a fan of the bacalaitos, but my wife thought they were great. The Mango tropical drink was also very good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was good, and they offer outdoor seating which was perfect for the weather. It was a busy place on the weekend, but the staff were very accommodating and managed to keep everything moving along smoothly. The one downside was that I tried the most famous pho and while it was definitely tasty, it was a bit too oily for my taste. Nevertheless, I finished the soup and was really happy with the coconut flavour. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a quick bite and enjoy good food.",1
"I am SHOOK it has taken me this long to review Jongro!If you're looking for the quintessential NY KBBQ experience, Jongro is your spot. You don't need a reservation and can put your name in for whatever size group you need. They'll text you when your table is ready - I've never waited more than 45min, even on a weekend. The serve the classic banchan (everything onion is my favorite) along with some sauces and steamed egg which is delicious. Make sure to order the kimchi pancake!All the proteins are good, but the most delicious is the marinated kalbi!!! This is a must. Belly and jowl are great too. It's not AYCE like a lot of KBBQ, but it's a good price for solid product, and I promise you will not go hungry!",0
Great neighborhood spot for a relaxing casual evening to sit outdoors and listen to live music. Great veal parmigiana!,0
"I've been to this location a few times now and it has always been hit and miss. The service is usually really good, but the food has been variable. The last time I went, the food was just not up to par - the whipped cream was missing, and the cupcakes were served in regular cups rather than ""gourmet"" cups, which was a huge oversight. The icing also didn't have any syrup, which was a huge let-down. Overall, the product wasn't great - definitely not up to Amorino standards.",1
"Not good. I got the spiciest level and I read on the menu that their house spice is made up of 22 different spices. I had high expectations especially with the high ratings of this place, but was really disappointed that the spice was sooo salty and honestly not flavorful. I noticed it said they used peppercorn in their spice, but I didn't taste that one bit. For a place named ""MaLa"" (meaning numbing spicy), I expected them to use peppercorn to the fullest potential and have that numbing flavor! I think the ingredients in the pot were of alright quality, but honestly the spice/flavor ruined it. Very not worth the price and def can find more authentic Chinese food elsewhere",0
"I love it when restaurants do a twist on a classic. This was an American/southern version of an eggs benedict, replacing the English muffin with cornbread, and the ham with chicken sausage. Unlike other restaurants that try too hard, the execution here was simple and sweet. The home fries were also the perfect little bite-sized goblets of nicely seasoned crispy goodness. If you can get your shit together to make a reservation for brunch a few days ahead, or can bear the hour-long wait at the door, this will be a very nice brunch.Benedict Johnny (cheddar cornbread, maple chicken sausage, poached eggs, roasted tomato hollandaise, home fries)",0
"This place has so many good reviews but there are so many better places in Manhattan. We had the rib ramen, tonkatsu ramen, pork and chicken dumplings. The dumplings were great! But my ramen was just eh. Portion was really big. We got the fresh noodles and that was good but the broth was eh. And not hot enough either. Maybe I should have gotten something else. But for Ramen next time I'll pass. Service was good but it wasn't busy so.",0
"Happened to walk by this location when I was heading across town trying to get to the west side location.  Pleasantly surprised. Tacos are great, as usual.  Pandemic times removed the ticket system on my last visit and left me confused but the food is as good as ever, though both the cashier and the cooks still both ask what tortillas you want.  Pork is awesome, beef is good, chicken is solid if forgettable.  Tacos are open, quesadillas are slightly bigger tacos with cheese and the mulas are the 2x tortilla creation you'd expect as a quesadilla at other spots.  Ask for limes and you'll get a bag with a few plus some pickled peppers, another change in pandemic life.  No eating inside but they have some barrels outside where you can park yourself and chow down.",0
"If I were to ever move from NYC, XFF would be one of the places that I'd miss first. We're so lucky to have this place be an NYC exclusive. This particular location is one of the newer ones and is right by the West 4th Street subway station. Seating is also plentiful and there is even a clean restroom. My go-tos are the spicy cumin lamb hand-pulled noodles and their pork burger. Both are prepared wonderfully and are customer favorites. The noodles are extra chewy and does a great job at taking in all the herb and spice infused chili oil. The lamb is extra tender and chewy and the cabbage and celery both add an elegant crunch factor. You can also adjust the spice level, but I'd recommend going medium to extra hot if you really enjoy that burning sensation in your stomach. I also like to take the pork burger and dip everything into the chili oil from the noodles if theres any left. Overall, I always enjoy my visits to XFF. I still get cravings for their noodles and burgers every now and then. Definitely give this place a shot if you haven't already!",0
Overall enjoyed my experience here! Not the best Italian food I have ever had but it is still really good! The highlight is the Cacio e Pepe they they serve out of a cheese wheel! I think I would only come here again for that particular pasta. The bucatini that I got was better than average but usually I would rather go to an Italian restaurant  that makes their own pasta because there are a lot of places in the city that do!My favorite part of the meal was the appetizer we got! It was very unique. Came with meat on crackers with a creme brûlée type sauce to dip it in. Would recommend getting it if you come here,0
"Food was really mediocre. Skip the tuna poke, it is void of any sort of flavor and very overpriced. Guacamole was really good, probably the highlight of the meal. My burrito bowl was different from my friend's (hers had a sauce of some sort and mine did not) so I essentially had an entire bowl of brown rice with 4 shrimp and some pick mixed in, topped with tortilla strips. Won't try it again. The kitchen was extremely slow the night we went, but the staff was extremely apologetic and took a meal off the bill due to the extreme delay. Maybe they are still working out some kinks, but wouldn't put this on my hit list, and wouldn't recommend to someone looking for a really impressive meal.",0
"I just had the best meal of my life at Tori Tantan Ramen! The broth was so creamy and flavorful, and their yakitori set was an absolute must! It was also really affordable and the atmosphere was adorable. The service was great as well. MMMMM those noodles tho!!!!",1
"A hole in wall place nearby mount Sinai hospital in UES. The food is OK but there are days when it's just plain bland. They recently changed their name, formerly known as paragon Thai. In addition to the name change, they also raised their prices and lowered the food portion. I like my pad Thai spicy and always ask for 2 hot sauce on the side. I was recently told ""since you ordered 1 meal, you get 1 hot sauce."" Customer service was never great but I guess that also went down along with the name change.",0
"Avra Madison has a great lunch option on a late Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy, but the customer flow was well managed. We all had the Salmon Tartar and we all enjoyed it. For the main course, we had the Lavraki (Branzino) and Lamb Chops. The Lamb Chops were done perfectly and worth the supplemental charge. The chocolate cheesecake and the orange cake provided a nice finish to the meal. We definitely expect to be back!",1
"I visited this restaurant with my roommates and we absolutely loved it! The flavors were so unique and we all loved the mozz sticks. They didn't travel too well, but that didn't bother us because we wanted to try all of the different flavors. My favorite was the original, but everyone in our group loved each and every flavor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something different and delicious!",1
"I was really impressed with the Egyptian street food at this restaurant. The cheese hawawdhi Crispy thin bread with beef patty with cheese veges was delicious, and the mint lemonade was refreshing. I would definitely recommend trying this place if you're ever in the area.",1
"I had a pretty tasty pizza at this restaurant, although it was a bit on the expensive side. I recommend trying their specialty slices, which will run you about $6. They don't have tap water, so I threw in a bottled water too, and it came to about $16 total. The pizza was NY style, and it was tasty. However, it could have been warmer. They're also quite large, so I probably would have been fine with only one slice. Unfortunately, they were out of garlic knots when I visited, but they do have a tiny bathroom for customers in the basement. Overall, I'd recommend this place, but I'll probably seek out another pizza place next time.",1
"Overall, the food was good, but the size of the dishes was a bit off-putting. The service was also ""ok"", but they could use some improvement with their timing. All things considered, I would still recommend this restaurant - especially if you're looking for a nice atmosphere and good food.",1
"I was so disappointed when Saint Theo's abruptly closed due to Covid outbreak on Wednesday. It was a bummer that our reservation was cancelled just minutes before. However, I understand safety is a concern and I appreciate that. I also sent them a message asking for a reservation and their response was ""you're not welcome here."" I don't think they deserve all the hype and business from locals, unfortunately. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",1
"The Pernil Sandwich With A Twist at Sophie's is a must-try. The roast pork is succulent and the onion slivers and jalapeno-green sauce are delicious. The garlic sauce and green sauce are also very bold and delicious. All in all, a very impressive sandwich.",1
"Wonderful dining experience overall - gorgeous space, and excellent service. We went in recently for my husband's birthday dinner. For starters we had the Foie gras et volaille en gelée and Thon à la portugaise (bigeye tuna). Both we absolutely delicious and a must. We also had the Quenelle de brochet, sauce américaine (pike dumpling) which was OK. For the mains we had the Sole Véronique (dover sole filets) and Halibut. The halibut was bland, but the dover sole was absolutely phenomenal - the best dish of the night!",0
"This restaurant is amazing! The chicken is very salty and delicious, and the noodles are unlimited. They're open 24/7, and the service is great. I would highly recommend it!",1
I had a great time at Pig and Khao! The food was fantastic and the service was great. I would definitely recommend ordering family style - it's the way to go! The Brussel Sprouts and the Papaya Salad were my favorite dishes. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!,1
"Dining at The Tang was such a pleasant surprise. This is probably the best kept underrated secret on the UWS. To start, the service here is phenomenal! The staff are extremely kind and patient.I highly recommend getting the braised beef noodle soup. This is an absolute must ! The beef was so tender and the flavor was so good. The shredded cabbage is also a must try! It's packed with lots of spice and flavor. This could honestly be a whole dish in itself.Overall great place and will definitely be back!!",0
"Went here with a Russian friend and my rating reflects her satisfaction. We got the beet soup, crab khachapuri, pork and veal dumplings, potato dumplings, and the ricotta cheese pancakes. The beet soup was good but could've used a little more lemon juice/citrus for flavor. The dumplings were pretty good and the pancakes weren't sweet, but they gave us a jam to have it with. We were expecting condensed milk as is shown in all the pictures online.",0
I had a great experience at this restaurant during COVID. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. I especially liked the 48 hr flavored cocktail we ordered. I'm excited to visit this place again in the future!,1
"Gaia Italian Cafe is a great spot for Italian food in the heart of Broadway. The buffalo mozzarella app was my favorite dish, and the pasta was also very good. The meat lasagna was a bit dry, but overall the food was great. The cookies and hot chocolate for dessert were a nice touch. I would definitely recommend Gaia Italian Cafe to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal.",1
"I had a decent experience at OBAO, but the pad thai was a bit too vinegary for my taste. The vermicelli bun was also decent, but the pork/shrimp content was a bit too light for my liking. The silverware was also rather dirty, which detracted from the overall dining experience.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors in Nippori, a mid-town spot that I found on a Saturday evening. By 7:00 when we left, it was about two-thirds full. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and our table of 4 + 1 toddler had no trouble getting service. The appetizers and ramen were served within a normal timeframe, fairly quick for the appetizers.

I liked the agedashi tofu, which had a slightly unctuous but light skin. The tofu was paired well with chunks of tender eggplant. The kara-age fried chicken pieces were nice and crispy. The gyoza were pretty standard, good fry on the bottom for extra crispness on the skin. The calamari-age was solid. The nippori ramen was good, with a coconut-soy based broth. My first time trying this type of flavoring served as ramen, and their take was pretty good.

The garlic ramen was my favorite of the meal. The seasonal special of ramen tossed in a garlic sauce with corn, bamboo shoots, pork chashu pieces, soft-boiled seasoned egg was delightful. Everyone's favorite was the beef gyuu ramen, with a sh",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The pizza looked just okay based on reviews and after ordering delivery it was just mediocre. The mozzarella sticks were the best out of everything. They didn't come hot so I had to heat them in the oven for a bit, but if they were delivered hot they would be great. The pizzas tasted a lot like dominos. I wouldn't order the pizza again but I would order the mozzarella sticks.",1
"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the great reviews, but my experience was not as great as I had hoped. The outdoor dining area is really nice, but the food didn't live up to the hype. The ramen was pretty bland and not very hot, and the portion sizes were a bit small for the price. The deli meat slices were also a bit dry and disappointing. Overall, I would recommend avoiding this place in the evening when it's cold outside - the temperature definitely didn't help the meal.",1
"I was so disappointed with the food at this restaurant! The curry soup was watery and lacked any flavor. The salmon was overcooked and dry, and the rice was not freshly cooked. The two bonus dumplings were already spoiled when they arrived. I couldn't even eat them. I'm surprised that this restaurant has high ratings on Yelp. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1
"Pretty good but not great. I've been to ippudos around the world and was a bit disappointed by the ramen that we ordered. Perhaps we ordered wrong! I shared the pork baos and the miso akamaru ramen. The baos were the star of the show, tender and slightly crispy blanketed by the soft, buttery buns that weren't soggy nor too hot. The miso akamaru is where we went wrong. It was the special seasonal ramen offering and came with pork, green onions, and the classic red garlicky paste that ippudo has been come to fame for. The soup broth was salty and unbalanced, far from the superior depth and complexity that I typically expect from an ippudo ramen. However, what made up for this was the breakneck speed of service, ambiance, and the staffs ability to handle the immense crowds at prime dinner time on a weekend. Very impressed and would return to order something different.",0
"We enjoyed our visit here! Quick service (we ate at the bar) and friendly, too. They have a nice assortment of the kinds of things one would expect at an Irish sportsbar in Midtown: nachos, burgers, salads, basic entrees, etc. Our food was good and fresh.",0
"My boyfriend and I came on a weekday morning and were seated right away. The food was decent, but I think Jacks Wife Freda and Reunion in Williamsburg are both much better. We had the Shakshuka and Challah French toast, plus coffee. The coffee was pretty weak and flavorless. Food, again, was decent. Just expected more.",0
"Salt and Savor is a small, family-run business that's been open for 3 years and almost closed twice! The owner was extremely friendly and the establishment was clean and fresh. They have options galore, from customizable breakfast platters and sandwiches to an extensive salad bar. I took forever to figure out what the heck I wanted, but the prosciutto, fig and arugula sandwich was delicious. The ultimate cobb salad was insanely huge, and my momma loved it. Their sandwich photos are insane - definitely worth checking out! And lastly, xheck out my foodie adventures on Instagram!",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The food was really yummy and aesthetically pleasing. However, I was a bit disappointed with the matcha horchata. It was way too grainy and wasn't even able to drink more than 1/4 of it. Nevertheless, overall I had a great time and would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"I'm so glad that they have outdoor seating that is adequately spaced apart.  It makes for a perfect setting.  You can still get your sauces indoors, just need to mask up.  The bathroom is also really clean.   It's a bit hard to review individual dishes so this is just a general pro/con list:PROS-  great value: For $36pp, AYCE is amazing. They come out in small quantities but that helps prevent food waste.- large selection of meat: more than most places- multiple pot selection styles: individual or split pot to share flavors- hand sanitizer and gloves at each table- dessert and Asian drinks galore included in AYCE price.- more diverse selection of hot pot items: there are definitely things that I did not see at other - strong vegetarian game- much larger variety of brothsCONS- nothing really. Weather but that's not the fault of the restaurant. And cold weather makes for perfect hot pot environment!",0
"** Check in on yelp and score yourself a free beer **Came here on a Wednesday night as a group of four. We made a reservation a few days before to ensure we were able to be seated. I was running a little late and my friends were asked to wait at the bar until the full party arrived.  We ordered the marinated beef package which was $95. It came with different cuts of marinated meat which ranges from skirt steak, bulgogi and many more. It was pretty decent and the waiter cooked it all for us. We also got add ons with the meat package - sizzling mushroom and kimchi stew. We also ordered:- chicken wings: nice and tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. Could have done with less sauce but that's my personal preference - jap chae noodles: very well made, portion was on the smaller side so we ended up ordering more - Korean pancake: tasted a bit different to other ones I've had. They may have used pumpkin in the batter?Booked my reservation via Seated app and there was additional perks with cashback so check that out too! All in all we spent about $60 per person which also included drinks and tip. Decor of the place is pretty nice and the bathroom was also clean. My clothes also didn't smell like I've been to a BBQ afterward which was a nice change!",0
"We came in last weekend for dinner. We made reservations for 6 and I sure am glad we did! The place is so tiny! There really only are just a few tables and some seats at the bar(ish) area that overlooks the kitchen. By the time we left, there were a lot of people lined up outside. The service was pretty quick. Not overly friendly but that was fine. We ordered the kale gnocchi and the lamb pappardelle. The gnocchi was very ok. It was very fluffy and pillow as good gnocchi should be. The sauce on top was alright. It just didn't have much flavor. The pappardelle was very good though. I would love to come in the try the daily specials though. It's also cash only which is always just disappointing.",0
"ZibZoob Thai is a great place to go for lunch near where I work. The food is really good, especially their green curry. It's creamy, thick but refreshing, and very easy to eat. The only downside is that the rice can get a bit greasy, but overall, the food is definitely high quality. The service is also very good, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend trying out their curries.",1
"Okay Korean food, probably wouldn't come again. Friends really liked the Seafood Pancake but I thought it was too oily and it didn't come out crispy enough. The ramen in the Budae Jungol was too soft/overcooked. Then the Bossam meat was alright, but I didn't like that the cabbage was blanched in salt water (or maybe it was seasoned? not sure but it was way too salty).",0
"We really enjoyed our meal at this restaurant. The dumplings were fantastic, and the beef noodles were even better. We didn't care for the peanut pocket things, but that's just our personal preference. Overall, a great experience!",1
"Came here to celebrate my cousins birthday , group of 9 girls since it was 9 people we had to get the price fix menu at $145 per person. Once seated we started with some Drinks I had the Lychee Froze, this was great, good taste & decent on the alcohol , regular Lychee martini too sweet, Cosmo good & the Spicy watermelon cooler were some of the choices not bad. On the appetizers Rock Shrimp Tempura was the winner for me this was very good , good Chicken Lettuce Wraps & Chicken Satays. Decent Veggie Spring Rolls & Pac Man Seafood Dumplings. The Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings were not great, these were not a hit at our table. Main course the Dry Aged Porterhouse was very good & so was the Peking Duck , good Kung Pao Chicken with a little bit of a spicy kick I didn't have any of the Lobster or Fish but the girls seemed to all like it. As for the sides way too much rice , Lobster, Crab & Chicken all pretty much tasted the same , could do with out the Fries & Onions rings I did not have any. Bok choy was good, very good Broccoli in garlic sauce. For dessert we had some Red Velvet cake not bad , Peanut Butter Cheese cake not a fan of peanut butter so I did not like it & Apple crumb cheese cake that was better. Nice looking place, fun vibe & atmosphere good music playing , service was good price wise , definitely on the high end a lot per person but they do give u A LOT of food way too much for a bunch of girls we took home a lot of leftovers,  overall we enjoyed our food & drinks.",0
"Zurutto Ramen & Gyoza Bar is a great spot for a quick, satisfying meal. The ramen is especially good during cold weather, and the sides are a great way to customize your meal. The pork gyoza are especially delicious, and the shrimp mayo is a nice addition. The karaage is also very good, and the agedashi tofu and seaweed salad are a nice touch. The service is fast and the prices are reasonable. Overall, Zurutto Ramen & Gyoza Bar is a great choice for a quick, easy meal.",1
This review is long overdued. So my friend and I came here after work (worked in the area) I heard about this place being a really good ass restaurant/ brunch spot so I decided on coming here. It was in October on like a Wednesday so it was your usual slow restaurant day where it's you and like one other table dining in. I placed my order for my drink and my friend who's ID expired was denied a drink I already knew not to expect much from there. The food was ok I enjoyed my French fries of course and my enchilada though it was borderline too damn crispy/burned the soy wings were just OK I had about two passion fruit drinks that definitely was made with about no alcohol in it. I know they are like one of the spots that closes the latest around there If I'm in the LES again late and needed food maybe I'll give it a try again.,0
"We had a terrible experience at this restaurant. The staff was very rude and pushy, and the time limit on our lunch reservation disappeared as soon as we sat down. Our food was also disappointing - the Burrata was bland, the Fritters were mediocre, and my pasta dish was terrible. Overall, this was a terrible experience and we would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"What's the coziest thing you can think of? Warm bed in a cold room with rain hitting the roof? Lawn chair in the grass during early summer? Your mom's lap? The Wren is the bar/restaurant equivalent of that. Yes. Please. Came for lunch with a friend, and the bartender told us to sit wherever. We parked ourselves in the back and shared a French press coffee. He got a grilled cheese and tomato soup, which I tried and loved. It was so creamy and comforting. He also had a beer. I got the roasted chicken salad, which was so hearty, healthy, and filling! It has cotija cheese, avocado, jalapeno, and lettuce. They skimp on nothing, and it's well worth the price. Everything came so quickly, yet was very fresh. Service is efficient, and interrupts you minimally. Prices are beyond affordable, especially for the area. The Wren is all-around dreamy, and the rustic vibe makes it hard to leave. Recommend you go for brunch, an event, dinner, or drinks!",0
"The service was really bad here and the food was mediocre. When we went on Saturday night, they said they had a table available inside, but then a few minutes later, they said nevermind and asked if we wanted to sit outside. We said sure, and they sat us outside but didn't give us menus and essentially forgot about us. We had to find staff to bring us menus, and it took a long time for the food to come out. We asked for water so many times and they NEVER BROUGHT ANY WATER. I wasn't able to get water until after I paid the check.... One of my friends ordered rice and never got it. The food was okay. I was really hungry since I didn't eat all day so I ate everything, but the chicken was dry, the beef was too salty, and everything was mediocre. All the other kbbq spots on this street had long waits and if I wasn't starving, I'd prefer to just wait for another place. This place was also overpriced.",0
"When I got here, I was a little disappointed because yelp showed it as a small plates and tapas place. Once I ordered, all of those thoughts went away. We got and shared the falafel platter and the shrimp casserole. Both were delicious and appropriately sized.Service was great. Super polite and punctual. Seating outside was great. Sheltered, ornate and still open air enough to feel like it makes sense amid a pandemic. I'd definitely return and recommend it.",0
"I love that Beyond Sushi is an 100% plant-based sushi fusion spot, but the taste of their food missed the mark in the lack of diversity of flavor. When eating different sushi rolls, one should be able to appreciate that each roll is different from the other, in flavor, content, texture. However, of the 5 dishes I ordered that night, I felt like the flavor of the sushi rolls and the taco sampler were very similar. Despite ordering 5 dishes, I felt like I was only eating 3 different dishes. However, the staff here are very friendly and attentive, our food came out quickly, and the vibes of this place is fun and nice to have a meal with friends.",0
Very interesting concept... I've never had something that taste like this before. It almost tasted like a toasted tortilla but then also has a sesame bread texture. It's crunchy but also soft on the inside where the ingredients are. It's reminds me of a pita bread also but it's much thinner and crispier. They have a nice Yelp check in offer right now and we got the preserved veggies flavor since we didn't want something spicy. (Not sure how spicy the other ones are). I really like it! It's a tad bit salty on the first bite but the more you eat the tastier it gets. Highly recommend trying it!,0
"Hello Vietpho!

I had a great time at your restaurant! The banh mi made on authentic bread was a decent price and the sandwich tasted good too. The shrimp in the peanut sauce was a lovely addition and the ginger ale was perfect for cooling down afterwards.

The only thing I didn't like was that there were few seating options. It was right near the subway, more of a takeout joint, so it was hard to find a spot to sit. But overall, I had a great time and would recommend Hello Vietpho to others.",1
"I was really let down by our experience at Hibachi House. The prices are a bit high for the quality of food and service. We waited over 30 minutes to be seated, which was frustrating. The fried rice is an extra $5, which is crazy. The tricks performed by the hibachi chefs were not particularly impressive, and the food itself was mediocre. I was disappointed overall. Flame on the UWS is a better option.",1
"This place was pretty good. I had the pork belly and lamb bao that came with 2 baos each and they were really flavorful. They have beer that is cheap, relative to the area. They even have the Thai beer that I like in bottles. I love the open concept kitchens and sat right at the bar. I was a pretty bummed about the chicken nuggets. They and the sauces it came with weren't very flavorful and I felt like I paid for over-priced McDonalds chicken nuggets. (Would have even preferred those)

The different baos and chicken nuggets didn't quite fill me up as expected for the amount I paid. I probably would have been more full if I got the ramen. I saw they use the same pork belly in the ramen as the baos.",1
"4.75 stars for great food! Came with a reservation on a weekend lunch and there was plenty of seating. Beautiful decor with a long setup. The bar is quaint, small and homey. 1. Octopus - Flavorful. Just as good as others.2. French toast - My favorite and best french toast I've had. The pandan was light. Texture was insane. Crunchy / firm outside and buttery soft inside. 3. Ribs - A bit spicy but very good and soft4. Noodles - Spicy. Comes with lobster. I think they could tone down the spice a bit for those who don't like spice.5. Ube ice cream sundae - Very good presentation and flavorful. Overall, had a great time. Would be great to take the family, date or friends. I will definitely be back!",0
"Saltbae is definitely a place you want to visit if you're a fan of meat. The first couple bites were amazing, but towards the end of the whole rib-eye it got a little hard to chew. The Nusret burger was also better in my opinion, since it had mix of cheese and caramelized onion. The fries were pretty ordinary though.",1
"Grabbed dinner at Los Tacos No. 1 on Thursday evening. An okay iteration of classic tacos, but a terrible space and disappointing meat and guacamole.Quality: They were decent tacos, but no where near the level of the hype. I tried three different tacos, Carne Asada, Pollo Asado, and Adobado, each on Corn Tortillas Con Todo. The Pollo Asado just was not good at all. Overwhelming with a burnt flavor and lifeless chicken, The Adobado was fine, but I expected it to be more flavorful. Only the Carne Asada really had that kick and taste I was looking for, but it was still a bit overdone. Also, I don't know what was going on with the guacamole, but the liquid mess was just not great.Quantity: Depending on how hungry you are, two to three Tacos are needed.Value: $3.50 to $4 for a Taco depending on the protein.Ambiance: Los Tacos No. 1 is located in Chelsea Market in Manhattan. Little more than a stand with a bar area, it is a packed and uncomfortable space. They had a music battle with the shop next door, that created this vortex of noise. You order at the front then bring your receipt around the side to get your food. Then you get in everyone else's way as you attempt to stand and take down extremely juicy tacos. It is messy and crowded, making it hard to enjoy.Crowd: More crowded than it needs to be as there is no seating area near the shop.Service: Not a fan of the set-up, but they have your food out fast.Parking: Very difficult parking situation for Chelsea Market.",0
"Wow! As a crepe lover, this was a great experience. There were A LOT of options on the menu. We picked the entree variety since we were starving and had just eaten a ton of desserts elsewhere (otherwise I totally would've just eaten the dessert crepes). They make the crepes right in front of you so you know it's definitely fresh (and it's oddly satisfying to watch the process). The ham, cheese, egg crepe was very basic but delicious. My friend got the Saigon chicken which he completely loved. Definitely will come back when I visit NYC again.",0
"Smith & Wollensky is a great old-fashioned steakhouse with some unusual choices. The Cajun steak is really good and the flavors are a delicious blend of decent steak and well balanced seasoning. The sides are classic, and I recommend the potatoes and spinach. Even though the tables are close together, it's still a great place to eat.",1
"I've had Loring Place on my bookmarks for a year and a half now. I was very excited to come here, and I told my parents about it. The moment we had gotten there, the staff was far from friendly. We had to find parking, which isn't too easy to find on a Saturday night, which unfortunately made us a bit late for our reservation. On arrival, after telling the front desk about our reservation the guy at the front desk said ""oh you're 20 minutes late, we were calling your reservation for 15 minutes"" mind you the restaurant was empty and there wasn't anyone waiting at the time. Lucky for us, they ""allowed"" us to keep our reservation and we had been able to sit down. And the service made up for the way we were treated upon our arrival. My family and I ordered the cauliflower (which was very good) the broccoli salad, (I wouldn't order again) whole wheat pasta, (a small portion of pasta) the spicy pizza, (the pizza was the best tasting part of the meal) and the sea bass. (Sea bass was a bit fishy) They had also given us a complimentary acorn squash which was nice. The drinks were also good, (I had ordered the 123 resporado) but a bit expensive at $16 each, with glasses of wine around $18. I will compliment the atmosphere though - it's an ideal place for a date, and it's very spacious..just didn't meet my overall expectations regardless of its amazing Yelp rating.",0
"I visited this restaurant for lunch and was impressed with the variety of kimbap on the menu. I especially liked the stuffed tofu, which was delicious. The atmosphere was relaxed and the service was friendly. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite crowded and it took a while to get our food. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at Roti Roll Bombay Frankie! The aloo masala was my favorite dish, but the lamb and masala unda were also great. I would definitely recommend skipping the samosa chaat and focusing on the rotis. They offer an impressive amount of flavor in a short time.",1
"Updating to 3 stars because of poor service while dining with a party of 10. Ten minutes after our reservation time of 5:30, a waiter began asking when the entire party would arrive, as they had another reservation in two hours  at 7:30...? We ordered a variety of kebabs for the entree, and it came with the three different kinds of rice. They put all the meat on one big plates and mixed all three rice dishes in another big plate. Needless to say it was difficult to pass around a heavy plate of meat around a large table of 9 people. We asked them to separate the rice because there were sweet, sour, and savory all in one dish, and some people don't like each type. They poured them from this large plate onto three different plates but the rice was mixed together regardless. The salmon kebab was over cooked, despite specific request to NOT overcook it. The waiter was defensive, talking back. I didn't appreciate the arrogant service.",0
"Plantains and pork belly -- plate full of plantains with one piece of pork belly. Not worth in our opinion.

Watermelon and pickles -- an interesting dish with great flavor but not a must order.

Drunken deviled eggs -- not a lot of flavor but presentation was great!

Fried chicken -- tasted like normal fried chicken, I think even Popeyes has more flavor.",1
"I absolutely love coming to Tacombi for their delicious food! Every location I have been to so far has had great service along with delicious food.

For Valentines Day, my husband and I went to the Empire state building and I decided to bring him to Tacombi since Empire state building offered the prefixed dinner voucher. The voucher was $15.51 plus applicable sales tax and tip for a grand total of $19.99. We got 2 vouchers. Each one included 1 appetizer, a choice of 4 served family style tacos per person and unlimited homemade refreshing Mexican fruit drinks.

When we got there, we were told that the menu had changed but wasn't updated on the Empire state building website and it was 2 tacos per person which was a let down. So we got Guac and Corn Esquites as our apps. Both were good but the corn was out of this world! Sooo soo good and worth trying! The Guac was a smooth blend of Haas avocados, jalapeno, red onions and lime juice thatch made fresh through out the day for the best fresh taste & it's served with homemade Vista Hermosa tortilla chips.

For the tacos, we got the Beef bab",1
"Always my immediate go to for a quick breakfast as I'm headed to work. Conveniently located right above the W. 4th St. subway station, I make a pit stop here before transferring trains. I love coming here for their warm pastries that are made fresh every day. I also love the steam egg creme bun!! I know that this place is carbs galore but I really like that it's affordable and fills me up quickly for a day when I can't be bothered to have a healthy breakfast. The buns are only less than two dollars I believe and the pastries are all less than three dollars!My recommendations:-egg creme bun (be quick in the morning, they run out fast!)-tuna pastry-egg tartI ordered a birthday cake from here as well, which was perfect because it was not too sweet!",0
"Not pleased at all.We arrived on time for our reservation. People are lingering at the table we reserved and the staff had to ask them to leave. But then we were told that the table they told us was ours in fact was not. Mind you, it's cold outside while we continue to wait...We (a party of five) were seated 25 minutes past our reservation time. I have never encountered being seated late for a reservation. The restaurant's excuse was that they were overbooked.Unacceptable.They should have called to say we needed to cancel. That would have saved us time, frustration, and we would have actually had a punctual dinner.As certain standards of courtesy are expected of diners, the same is expected of waitstaff as a paying customer.We finally got seated, but of course the waitstaff was sluggish and clueless throughout our entire meal. Forgot about food allergies, continual lateness with serving our apps and main courses, blah x 3.It's a shame because the food here is really good.But it's not worth trekking to for the subpar service.",0
"Made a reservation for my family for 6:30PM and were seated inside. Once we ordered, we were brought appetizers on the house*. The wait for the rest of the food was about 50 minutes, which is a bit longer than I expected. Luckily because the portions are so small, relatively small groups can try several dishes. The only downside is if you have a large appetite, you will have to find somewhere else to eat afterward. *Everything Bagel Ricotta Puff (3.5/5) -- Super light, crisp puffs made of I don't know what served with everything bagel-topped ricotta. Nice bite, but a little rich. Fluke (5/5) Quail (4/5) -- Sweet, savory, sticky, smokey sauce with tender quail. Potato not necessary. Get if you want something teriyaki-ish. Octopus (5/5) -- Probably the best octopus I've ever eaten...lightly crusted outside and tender inside. I don't know what they did with the potato, but its silkiness/airiness paired well with the octopus. Chicken (3/5) -- Nothing special, but still tasted good. The porridge seized up quickly after arriving at our table and reminded me of risotto without the bite. Wagyu Beef (5/5) -- No words, just get it!!!!!! Halibut (3/5) -- Perfectly cooked halibut. Curry had a prevalent sweet, herbal note and I thought it needed some salt. The crunchy golden quinoa topping didn't add anything interesting to the dish. I think this dish needs starch and/or heat because every component is so light. Rice (3/5) -- Not worth the money. Go to Chinatown and get some lo mai gai if you want good lotus leaf rice. Good flavor, but based on the other Yelp reviews I'd read, I expected it to be stickier.",0
This is one Korean restaurant hat doesn't make non Korean speakers feel left out.  We tried the Yelp waitlist for the first time and it was good.  A little wait but accurate of the wait time.  The meat was tender and the waitress was friendly and also helped out with the cooking. I really like their yummy cocktails.  We had Lychee Soju Cocktail and Frozen Mango Bomb.  I wished it was Shapiro beer instead of Coors.  We ordered the marinated beef platter for two and green tea cold noodles.  All good and price is according to the area.  Nice decor with a feel like a night Asian market.,0
"What a great experience!  Things to know;1. They will only accept up to 2 credit cards per table. Not a huge deal. Just know it. 2. This is a massive dining room, so it doesn't feel intimate.The atmosphere really unique, and the food is quite delightful, and authentic.  There was nothing you could leave wanting for, save something extremely uncommon. We tried a wide variety of items at our table, except beef, and chicken feet. The soups were delightful. The tea was fresh and perfectly steeped. The dumplings were all cooked just right, not overdone and not too dry or too wet. I very much enjoyed the bacon-wrapped shrimp balls, which seems a very American item for Dim Sum, but really good nevertheless. Definitely consider adding this to your NYC experience.",0
"Covid is a great place to go for drinks and snacks. I usually sit outside, but given different temperatures and Weathers I've also started to sit inside now during Covid. They've done a good job of keeping tables separate. I also usually request quieter tables and they are able to comply. They have a lot of seating, a large amount of space at the bar and lots of smaller tables in two very large rooms. The wait staff usually knows what specials they have for the day and are very friendly and helpful. I usually think of this as an upscale bar with good service. I've tried the tacos as well as the I'll have another cocktail and the Manhattan 36. I also really like the Tuna sashimi on avocado which is really good and I would recommend getting that every time. I don't really recommend a lot of the vegetarian dishes except perhaps for the elote. The cauliflower is deep fried and over sweet but I did like the shishito peppers. I'll be back for sure, it's one of the better spots near Penn Station.",1
"Terrible food, be aware! Ordered salmon curry for lunch. The curry soup was watery and lack of flavor. The salmon was overcooked like a stone. Had to trash half of the fish as it was not chewable. Rice was also not freshly cooked. The two bonus tiny dumplings were already spoiled upon arrival. I am surprised at the restaurant's high rating on Yelp.",0
"I had higher hopes, I must admit. Came here for lunch. Service was fast, easy to get in and out. I ordered the Bangkok bowl, but I just didn't enjoy it. The shrimp were over cooked, the sauce was overwhelming and the poached egg was very under cooked. I'm really happy I did not get food poisoning.",0
"The food here was delicious, but I think they could use some help getting their orders correct. The cauliflower was roasted perfectly and the cucumber salad was refreshing and great for a warm summer evening. The merguez was nicely grilled and had charred bits. That amount of food was a decent starter for two, but I think another entree would have really rounded out the meal.",1
"Luke's Lobster is a fairly dependable chain for solid lobster rolls. I stopped by for lunch recently as their limited time lobster roll flight ($36) caught my eye. It comes in three different flavors, lemon butter, mala mayo, and truffle butter. Of the three, I thought the mala mayo was very creative-- it featured mala spice-infused kewpie mayo from Omsom, which enhanced the sweet lobster meat and gave the sandwich a good kick. It was definitely the one to wake me up, as the lemon butter and truffle butter were good but not nearly as satisfying.",0
"I came here since I had a deal on the Your Local app for a free meal and was heading to a nearby workout later that night.  Ordering through the app was easy and pick up was smooth.  I got the salmon supreme which included 3 different types of salmon sushi rolls with a side of edamame and kelp.  Overall it was average.  The kelp was surprisingly not salty (good for those sensitive to salt, but not me), but that was fixed with a bit of soy sauce.  Edamame was pre-shelled and standard.  The salmon was fresh, but not as rich or flavorful as other salmon that I've had.  Rice was average in terms of taste and softness.  The big draw to this place would be the service, speed and ambiance over the food.  The seating area had a relaxing open feel and was bar style with a few areas that could be utilized as a group table or single seating.  Hooks were below table tops which was convenient for bags and jackets.  Some tea light candles were scattered about to add to the atmosphere.  Napkins, chopsticks and soy sauce were nearby all seats.  I'd return here (especially with a Your Local deal or after 9 when all prepackaged items are 1/2 off) for a quick sushi fix if I'm in the area again.",0
"I visited this restaurant with a friend and we were both impressed. It wasn't too crowded and the line moved quickly. The portion size was good and the pork-noodle combo I had was delicious. They have a variety of spicers available, so if you're looking for a bit of spice, you'll be happy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Let's say I expected more but I will keep the rating to four stars coz everything we ordered was super delicious.I expected more in terms of food options available  on the menu they offer. It's super limited specially if you are not a meat eater, you are barely left with some sea food and then the basic vegetarian dishes. They have some pretty cool cocktails on the menu, I ordered tequila based cocktail 'Hot like Kohli'. Asked them to customize it (not add pear syrup), but they weren't able to. Nonetheless it was really good; spicy, tangy and generously filled with tequila. I would never think okra goes with avacado but to my surprise it paired perfectly well,  making crispy okra a hit from the get go. Tiger prawns were generous in size, delicious, moderately tangy and flavorful. Do not miss out on them.However star of the evening was gunpowder Branzino. Perfectly cooked fish with sweet and sour mango sauce with a goan cuisine touch to it. Loved every bite of it, probably one of the best Indian dishes I have had in Newyork. Will visit Gupshup again just for this dish alone.My suggestion to this restaurant is to include more fusion sea food and vegetarian options. You are nothing short of a Michelin star if only you could work a bit more on the menu.",0
"The overall taste of the food at Kazunori is just as good as the other location I've been to. The only downside is that the hand rolls are rolled a little looser, which doesn't have the same hand feel. However, the taste is still just as good. The location is also great--it's in a food hall so you could easily grab a drink or something while you wait.",1
"BC is nestled within Chelsea Market which is a great place to visit, although, it's busy regardless of when you go. There are always people milling about and I found it a bit hectic to navigate while pushing a Cadillac of a stroller, all by myself. I was in the area for a completely unrelated reason but the thought of a German beef brat made me quiver with excitement so, on the way out, I decided to grab a lunch to go.I am a lover of cased meat (that IS what she said) so I ordered a couple of beef brats on buns with sides. Their lunches are $8 and come with your choice of brat, either on a bun or currywurst style which seems to be sliced and sauced. I went with buns for each and the guy was really nice, separating the toppings so that the buns would stay in tact. Unfortunately, the containers were all crap and the onion and sauerkraut liquids ended up partially soaking up into the buns and soaking the entire paper bag and all the contents. Not his fault but I was a little bummed. Their fries are amazeballs though; very well-seasoned.If I could do it all over, I'd have eaten there but babes had a long day and she was not having it. We walked back to my car, sat in the AC and chilled out while I scarfed down my brat before heading back home.",0
"Came here with my cousin right before Covid hit for shutdown after one of our girl's spa day.Big Wong is one of Chinatown's classic and popular eatery. It has been around for a long time and I predict it will continue to be around for a long time. It has all the classic and delicious comforting flavor. Coming here is like seeing an old friend with a smile. You know what you want and is getting into when you come here for a nice meal. I love their roast bbq meats; flavorful, juicy/tender and delish. I never had any dry bbq meat or any issue when I'm here.",0

"This was a very tasty burger. I made the order and it was delivered still hot. So, I got to experience the fresh flavor of this burger and I will say it's pretty good. I need to revisit this place and try other dishes on the menu. Live, love and laugh- Sha",0
"- enjoyed the pork soup dumplings (they give an order on the house to regulars), good flavor and thin skin- the broth for the spicy beef noodles was really flavorful so much so my nana ended up spooning it on to her soup dumplings instead of the accompanying ginger/vinegar and drinking several spoonfuls by itself- the portion of meat with the noodles was very generous and quite tender, definitely over a lb - the noodles were soggy, the dish would've been perfect had they been a bit al dente- the milk tea was very large and way too sweet for my taste, I had to wait for my ice to melt and water it down to drink it (would not order again) - personable attentive staff- reasonable pricing for the area",0
"I've been to the Gramercy Tavern before in their Dining Room and decided to go to the other section (the Tavern) to throw my friend a birthday dinner.  I told Gramercy Tavern we were celebrating his birthday in advance and they wrote a cute note and a dessert which was much appreciated.  The Tavern is substantially more affordable than the Dining Room but I would definitely not call it cheap- and to be honest it shouldn't be.  The food quality and atmosphere are great.  My only qualm about the meal hence four vs. five stars is that, honestly speaking, I wasn't a huge fan of the burger.  It was super salty to me and albeit I do consume a lot of salt (don't do this kids! lol) it was a bit too much for me.  I had a piece of my friend's sea bass which was delicious.  I do have a soft spot for Gramercy Tavern though and will definitely return- they just need to bring back that absolutely fantastic goat cheese and bread!",0
"Good ramen. I loved the flavor of the koku ramen. I got it at 3x spiciness. It was very flavorful. The broth was deceivingly spicy. It looked like the non-spicy broth but definitely packed a punch. The pork is super tender and juicy and they gave plenty of it. All the ingredients fit very well with each other.What I don't like is how they blast pop music so that you can't hear what your friend is saying. I also think it's too hot in the restaurant for ramen. When people are eating such hot food, you need to lower the temperature to accommodate that. Other than that, I would definitely go back to try the other ramen options they have as I loved the taste.",0
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The atmosphere is really comfortable and the variety of food is great. I've brought so many people here that I can't even remember who I've brought here at this point. I'll say, most of my friends who have come here just think this place is mediocre though. I'll tell you that I always love to come here to overstay my welcome (I usually come late, so not like there are parties waiting for my table). They never kick you out and service is still attentive even after serving the table for 2 hours. Food-wise, I appreciate that their menu had so many options, not just the typical things you see but the typical things with a twist. Fried chicken on waffles? They have it, except it's chicken karage (Japanese). Want eggs Benedict? They have that too (although no twist on this). French toast? They also have this in the regular one or with matcha. The matcha one was pretty good even without the syrup. Typical steak and eggs or frites are here too. Their fries are amazing btw. Want some raw fancy options like tartare? Truffle? They have those too. Non alcoholic mixed drinks? Fancy coffee? Check, check, check",1
"I wasn't a fan of this restaurant. The ramen was really bland and I couldn't taste any of the flavors. It was also really cold, so I don't recommend it.",1
"This place is amazing.  I order fro them for lunch frequently during work. The 3-roll lunch special is a great deal. Their sushi and Thai food is great and has a lot of vegetarian options. I even have done large catering orders more than once and the staff is great and easy to work with. There aren't usually any issues, and if one does arise they fix it without me having to ask or get upset.",0
"Came here less than two weeks after they opened and was pleasantly surprised by the variety in their menu. Would recommend the mandarin duck dish and the soft serves! The cauliflower dish was ok, had better. The wontons also have a thicker skin which isn't my preference, but some may prefer it :)",0
"My boyfriend took me to Park Avenue Summer during Restaurant Week and we had a lovely evening. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful - The décor is on theme (obviously lol).   We sat down and were greeted by our waiter, with complimentary cornbread and watermelon bites - Both were tasty, especially the sweet/salty butter that came with the bread! To start, I ordered the Garden Mule ($18). It is a pretty steep price for a cocktail, but it is so worth it in my opinion. I usually am not a mule girl, but you can't go wrong with Ketel One, basil, jalapeno, lime & ginger!The menu for Restaurant Week is three courses for $42. I ordered the local burrata, heritage pork loin, and toasted coconut crème brulee. My boyfriend ordered the corn gnocchi, creekstone skirt steak (+ $8 supplement), and the white chocolate & citrus mousse. Both of our starters were amazing - The burrata and peach combo worked surprisingly well and the truffle in the corn gnocchi was to die for (LOVE TRUFFLES). But, when it came to our entrees, my pork was extremely undercooked so I had to send it back. The waiter was super receptive & expedited me a new dish very quickly, so I wasn't too upset. Once I got a properly cooked piece of pork loin, it tasted delicious and my boyfriend loved his steak. Regarding desserts, the coconut crème brulee was unreal - the macadamia nuts added a salty crunch that was delectable! My boyfriend's citrus dessert, however, was a bit weird tasting, and we both decided mine was the real winner.Although the meal was not perfect, I want to return for the Autumn/Winter/Spring change-up to see how they switch up the décor & menu.",0
"I recently visited Up Thai in the mid/upper east side and I really enjoyed it! The place is relatively cozy, but not overwhelmingly so. The ambiance is dimmed and private enough that you can have a conversation across the table without shouting at the top of your lungs. It would be good for a casual outing as well as for a date night. Make sure you get your name on the waitlist before you arrive to avoid long wait times.

The stand-out features of the menu are the vibrant flavors in each of the dishes. On this occasion, we tried the crepe dumplings, which were a super shareable appetizer that melts in your mouth with a medley of textures and flavors - the crunchy nuts, soft dumpling shells, sweet sauce and meaty filling. It was a cool start, and even better when accompanied with a Lychee Thai Iced Tea :)

For mains, we tried the chef's specialties that were crispy duck themed - a duck salad and duck prig pao, both from the page-long list of ""chef's specialties."" We wanted to try something we wouldn't be able to experience at other restaurants, and we were *not* disappointed...",1
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The food was good and the portions were ample. However, I wasn't thrilled with the service - it was a bit slow and the waiters were a bit forgetful. And, the smell of the clothes at the bar was really unpleasant. All in all, it was a decent lunch spot.",1
"Street Taco is a really pretty restaurant with delicious tacos. I had the chicken tinga, fried chicken, and carnitas tacos and they were all really good. Some of the tacos had double tortillas to keep them together, which is an amazing idea. I've never seen that before. I also had a classic margarita, which I would recommend. My boyfriend had the passion fruit jalapeno margarita, which I would only recommend for those who enjoy super spicy food. Street Taco is very close to my house, so I'm definitely going to be back.",1
"We had an amazing dinner here and incredible service. This was the best steak I have ever had in a beautiful ambiance. The waiter was very helpful with helping me to navigate the menu with my gluten allergy. For an appetizer, my grandpa ordered the Caesar salad (big enough for 2 to share) and had a poached egg in it. He enjoyed the Caesar salad but it had croutons in it so it was not gluten free. I ordered the NY strip and I loved the pepper crust. The steak was big enough for 2 meals though. I ordered a side of the twice baked potatoes which were incredibly tasty. I contemplated getting an order of the potatoes to go! My boyfriend ordered the ribeye with cream of spinach and loved his as well. The cream of spinach is not gluten free though. My grandmother ordered the lobster bisque which she said was very rich and tasty. She also ordered the scallops which were in a sweet, cinnamon-y sauce (very unique and yummy). For dessert, we ordered the 24 layer cake (which was huge) and everyone else said was very tasty. We will definitely be returning!",0
"Not a fan of Thai but their display of fried chicken caught my attention, made mestop and look and the rest is history (or in my tummy.). They ran out of half fried chicken so I ordered their chicken rice dish.  VERY solid.  Their ginger rice was so hot; steaming through the box.  It was fresh, well flavored and the whole dish came out very nice.  It was not crazy exceptional and I had initial plans to give it all a 4 stars. Until....they included a side soup, which by the way was also piping hot.  Usually restaurants give bland soups as a side (free). I did not order this so I assumed it would just be hot water and salt lol.  To my surprise, I noticed a piece of winter melon!  I know winter melon is nothing to be really excited over...just a vegetable that is like a soft turnip or the likes.  It is usually added to give a slight sweet flavor to soups etc.  Also pretty healthy.  Anyways, the little thing of a winter melon bumped this review to 5 stars!  It is a symbolof the details put into the side soup - the flavors were very good.   It definitely had other additional ingredients.  Excellent job!  I will be back for my fried chicken soon!  Yeaaaaah!!!",0
"Snagged a late reservation at Don Angie and went with a friend.  I had heard a lot of hype about this place and was excited to try it out.The restaurant is pretty small, with a large bar.  It was really busy on the day we went, and we had to wait a while for our reservation.We tried the following dishes:Charred Broccoli (2/5): Forgettable.  Would not re-order.Stuffed Garlic Flatbread (4/5): Tasty, rich, but definitely a must order for sharing.  It is a decent size, to be split amongst 2-4 people (depending on how hungry you are.  It's covered in cheese and sesame seeds and is really delicious.Sopressini and Smoked Mussels (3.5/5): I liked this dish, but my dining partner did not.  This dish had a very strong pepper and cilantro flavor, which is definitely not for everyone.  However, the pasta was really well made.Buffalo Milk Carmelle (4.5/5): Tasty and rich, with persimmon and black sesame.  The carmelle were filled with buffalo milk, and while obviously very rich, had a light quality to them.  This was a really nice dish to share.Ravioli (4.5/5): There was a ravioli special on the day we went, which included truffle, sunchoke, and straciatella.  It was very rich, and very tasty.  I really enjoyed this dish.For dessert, we had a black cocoa tiramisu.  It was good (4/5), but definitely not a classic tiramisu, if that is what you're looking for.I really enjoyed my experience at Don Angie and would absolutely return.  If you are planning on going, definitely make a reservation 30 days in advance.",0
"I miss the Union Square branch (the roominess of space!) but now they opened a branch right by 23rd street.  It's still fairly new, the service consistency is not there... yet. I've been here quite a few times during the breakfast hours. I love their pastry and cakes, it's lighter than the usual American cafes (lighter in sugar). Process at Paris Baguette: Upon entering, pick up your tray, lay down a parchment paper, pick up a pair of tongs and begin selecting your treats! I would often buy a good 5-7 items for my team.Some staff would individually wrap the pastry, which is great because someone on my team is allergic to nuts. This would prevent cross contamination.  However, literally the next day, another staff would just pick the pastry up with the wax/parchment paper and put them all together into a paper bag.  When that happened, I had to buy another pastry but asked it be separated. Then there's one time, when a staffer misheard what I ordered and overcharged me - but thankfully, her manager was able to correct and refund my card. I welcome having a lighter yet delicious option, as opposed to their friend next door (chick-FIL-a) with a food coma induced type breakfast.  Enjoy!! #eatwelltraveloften",0
"I would probably give my dinner experience there a 3.5 star if I could.. To start - I called to make a reservation and the person who answered was SO rude (I'm assuming it was the owner), I started asking a question and he basically hung up on me. We decided to eat there anyways and while the food was good, it's expensive for what it is and I feel like you could find better cheaper Mexican food in the area. The servers are overworked so I had to hunt down our waiter and wait almost 45 minutes to get my water glass refilled. The food came out very quickly and I feel like we were rushed so they could flip the table. They also forgot to bring out our rice and beans and then tried to charge us 3 times for it when the bill arrived (???). I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was small but good and had the chips and salsa to start. Please note this isn't chunky salsa, it's more like spicy dipping sauce which I didn't love. Maybe I just caught them on an off day - so would be open to trying again.",0
"Food: 4.0/5.0Service: 2.5/5.0Value: 2.5/5.0Decor: 2.5/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0Stool seating, no standard table/chairs presumably since they don't have much space and less comfortable seatings keeps the turns fast.  There are a bunch of counter seats.  The pho is good, and I quite like the broth (please let it be a real broth or I will be sad).  Portions/bowl sizes are more moderate v old school, perhaps not-actually-Vietnamese spots in other parts of town.  Appreciate having a pho option in this neighborhood.  Would go back..hope they stay open!",0
"The interior makes me feel like I'm sitting in the parlor of Singaporean royalty. The food reminds me that I'm in an incredible NYC restaurant ;) I went with three others and we ordered enough to fill the table. Starting with drinks, we got the Lasso the Moon, Bubble Trouble, and Api-Api. All were really different and flavorful. The colors were so pretty and the drinks were strong.  For appetizers, we ordered the Larb Fries and the Cantonese salt & pepper calamari. The Larb fries reminded me of crispy French fries but the calamari blew me away. It was perfectly cooked and not greasy at all. The pieces were big and the dipping sauce elevated it so much. Definitely a must order. For entrees, we got the soy sauce braised pork belly, the laksa noodles, fried rice, and pad see ew. One of my dining partners commented on this Pad See Ew being the best she's ever had. It was flavorful and filling. The laksa noodles were fantastic. The entire bowl was eaten. The broth was perfect and everything complimented the flavors. The rice was impressive and the pork was tender and juicy. The sauce on the pork was delicious. Overall, I would come back. Both for the decor and the fantastic food.",0
"Maybe a 3.75!Overall okay for $78 omakase new establishment in Chelsea.The stand out pieces - Shima aji, Trout, Caviar-Uni-Toro, shiro Ebi.Lotus Root wrap scallop is also interesting.They don't have liquor license yet.",0
"I visited Taverna Kyclades last Friday and have to say that the portions were quite large. My husband and daughter both enjoyed the chicken and the rice. The complimentary bread was also very good. However, I was very disappointed in the sole dish I ordered. It tasted like it had not been fresh and/or microwaved. I literally couldn't eat it and had to throw the nearly $30 dish in the trash. The lemon potatoes were just okay. I don't think we'll be returning or ordering take out again. I'd much rather pay more and get better quality from another restaurant.",1
I visited this restaurant and had the green double ($15). It was delicious! The vegan cheese was amazing and even my meat-eating friend had a bite and said it was incredible. The service was fast (I went around 8:30pm on a Saturday night) and the prices are pretty reasonable. The only thing I would note is the portions were a little smaller than I was expecting. I had been snacking and wasn't that hungry but still managed to finish the double. There also wasn't much variety to the menu (usually 2 main burger options and 1 rotating special) and the ingredients. Yay for more vegan burger places in New York City!,1
"*Review regarding delivery only*This has been a recent find of mine and I'm so happy about it.It's awesome how late they are open for delivery, it's really convenient when I get a late night craving for crab rangoons.Speaking of which, this is my new favorite place to get those delicious pockets of goodness. Perfect ratio of meat / wonton. I just wish they provided the sweet sauce that normally comes with this dish. I've also had the following which are pretty good:- red bean bun- pork bun (this one I wish had more filling in it)- bulgogi dumplings The only thing I've gotten that I didn't care for was their scallion pancake. For some reason it was very waxy tasting. Skip on this. Their delivery is fast and efficient. I look forward to trying their sushi soon.4/5",0
"I highly recommend checking out this new dim sum spot! The prices are great and the food was delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the restaurant was very clean. It's a great addition to the neighborhood, and I can't wait to come back!",1
I've been waiting for my sister who has celiac disease to visit so we could come here together. It was worth the wait! Everything was really good. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the fresh bread for the table - it very much tasted gluten free but all the pasta entrees were fantastic. We also had a great bottle of valpolicella. The ambiance is very authentic Italian as well!,0
"We went there for a private party on Pride parade day and the place was full. There was a very nice drag queen dance show in the outside area, very talented folks. Liked the food and drinks even though they mixed up our drinks several times. Liked the Jalapeño poppers, tater tots. I wish the service was more quick. Would definitely go back and get the good stuff",0
We ordered:    1. Calamari: chewy and disappointing. The taste was not          as I expected.      2. A sautéed vegetable. I think it was kangkong/          water spinach. I wouldn't order it again.           It's easy to cook at home and pricey for what you                get in the restaurant.       3. Crabs tasted okay but not really  unforgettable.       4. Beef chow fun was pretty good but not a reason to            come here.        5. Pork chops Peking style which we all liked. First time I ate here was in 1989 and they're still going strong.,0
This was my first visit. I ordered the Turkey Club and my friend had the steak sandwich. We enjoyed the meal while sitting at the bar. The pub is small and seating is close but not uncomfortable. The staff was nice and responsive. The wait time was reasonable so we had no complaints about anything.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really cool. The service was quick and fully masked which is awesome. The outdoor seating has lots of flowers and plants which makes for a great outdoor dining experience. The torta itself had a great bun, chicken that was perfectly crisp and had so many flavors inside. The avocado was reallyyyy good and fresh. Wish the size of the food was larger or came with some sides, but overall I had a really great experience. The price is a bit steep for what felt like more of a snack than a full on dinner, but overall I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"Can't go wrong with CM.  This time, we ordered goat confit, octopus and skirt steak.  Creme Catalan was good, but not the best among their desserts.  Most of the dishes ordered had sauce with pronounced acidity.....something to keep in mind when ordering a bottle.  We ended up ordering a Rioja, but I'll definitely order something more jammy or slightly effervescent next time. I should've ordered the chocolate cake. Here are some photos of their new outdoor seating as of Feb 9. -Goat confit: Melt in mouth and well seasoned goat. The sauce (goat cheese avocado) is to die for. I wish I had ordered an acidic white, not a Rioja-Steak: A bit too much of those balsamic onion this time. But the steak itself was perfectly prepared-Octopus salad: THE dish that makes me return here. Crispy yet succulent tentacles..... Just give it shot. You won't regret it. Maybe get an orange wine with this?",0
"Some of the best soup dumplings I've ever had outside of Shanghai!! They're authentic, made super fresh to order, and taste amazing. The soup inside the dumplings are *chef's kiss*. The staff steam the dumplings with each order so they come to the table steaming hot. We tried all the soup dumplings they had (chicken, pork, and crab). I personally loved the pork, my friends loved the chicken and crab. The vinegar they served was also amazingly fragrant -- I wanted to drink it straight.We came around 6pm on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. The staff are really friendly and even explained the steaming process to one of my friends. Bathrooms are downstairs.Disclaimer: it's fairly hard to get full off soup dumplings though. For a table of 5, we ordered 5 things of soup dumplings (each of us had 6) and an appetizer each but we still left a little hungry. With each plate of dumplings costing $11-12, I'd suggest ordering additional noodles, rice, or other entrees to supplement. The only part of my meal I didn't really enjoy was the hot and sour soup. It wasn't terrible, but I was a little off-put by how pepperty the soup was. They seemed to use a lot of black pepper so it was a little difficult to drink the soup because the pepper taste was overwhelming. The other appetizers my friends got, such as the beef scallion pancake, were good though!Would come again for the soup dumplings! I also want to try their noodles next time.",0
"The service was so so so wonderful. Funny story - I had booked a reservation for 7 out of town relatives for a Friday night at 6:30pm. When I checked my reservation at 3pm the day of, I realized I booked it for the following Friday. I frantically called them to see if they had any openings for that same evening. Even though they were pretty much fully booked, they were able to slot us in that same day and only a little bit earlier. The front desk works miracles.

When I finally arrived at the restaurant, the scene was lit. After work happy hour folks everywhere. Honestly, it looked like a fun scene and would recommend it as a place to bring coworkers. That said, we were planning to dine and we had a 6 year old with us. It was quite loud in the original spot they sat us at (next to the bar). At our request, the manager let us sit upstairs in the back. I'm so thankful for their hospitality and consideration. The actual food was good! Everyone has a great time, particularly with the shared charcuterie appetizer. I don't think anything was too memorable but everything was tasty. I would describe it as upgraded America bar food. Great option for people near",1
"I came to this restaurant on a weekday because I wanted my soup fix, and surely I was disappointed. We ordered an order of soup dumplings, and 5/6 of them were popped. So when we ate it, there was no soup in the dumplings! However, the meat filling was good, hence the extra star. We also ordered Dan Dan noodles, and it was a plate of noodles with a SMALL (the size of two quarters) scallop of meat. There wasn't a lot of sauce for us to mix the noodles, and when I ate it, the noodles were really bland. We also ordered the beef noodle soup, which is one of the specials of the restaurant. Super bland, kind of tasted like poorly flavored soap water. I had to add lots of chili oil to make it taste ok. Overall, it can be a great place but maybe I came at the wrong time. It's just not something I would try again.",1
The Grange is a great place to go for a casual meal with friends. The atmosphere is relaxed and the service is attentive and friendly. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant!,1
"I stopped by HH for lunch today and I have to say that it was a great experience. The deals they offer definitely sweetened the deal, and the space was spacious enough. The only downside was that people tended to seat themselves sporadically, leaving odd number of chairs empty in between. The swings by the windows were a great bonus though, and the guac and chips were delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good HH experience.",1
"Bao Bae is a restaurant that I would not recommend. The food was cold when it arrived, and the prices are a bit high. The dumplings were cooked perfectly, but I would not order them again. The pork belly buns were also small, and I found them to be a bit bland. The jalapeños had a nice spice, but the red cabbage was scarce and fresh. The shoyu ginger reduction came separately, and I just dipped everything in it lol. It was a bit on the salty side for my taste, but important to know for people ordering. Overall, I did not enjoy my experience at Bao Bae.",1
I am so happy to see Secchu Yokohama still stands strong post-Covid. N I am very excited for their new menu choices. Everything is perfect. N this is probably the best tempura omasake you can get in nyc.,0
"This little cafe in SoHo is a delightful find. The Greek focus is a welcome respite from the endless grain bowl places; this means spanikopita and moussaka, baklava and galaktoboureko rivaling the best Astoria has to offer (and that's no coincidence, the owner also owns the fantastic Artopolis bakery). The coffee is excellent - strong and flavorful. The atmosphere is bright and cheerful, and the service is friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend a visit!",1
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was pretty romantic, but the food wasn't very good. The scallops I ordered as an appetizer were bland and the salmon I had as the main course was also pretty bland. I'm not sure if it was just the dish I had, but I don't think I would come back here for a meal.",1
"Expensive- but that seems to be the theme for NYC- nothing is cheap.  Probably the most expensive breakfast I've ever had actually. HaHaHaHa.  The food was very good though & the portions were large.  Enjoyed our pitcher of mimosas too!  I really dug the atmosphere too!  It was busy, but not super loud.  Very clean, light, and airy feeling which was a nice reprieve from the City feeling.",0
Came here by myself for a quick Happy Hour. Had an amazing time. The bartender was super nice about letting me try some of their new summer beers and walking me through the HH food choices.I ended up getting the truffle Rice Balls for $5. They were so good! Super cheesy and gooey in the middle but fried nicely. Would go back just for those alone.I also used HOOCH here to get a free cocktail. It ended up being delicious and looked so pretty. With the nice weather they have some outdoor seating that I would love to come back and use.,0
"Was excited to see a new dim sum/Chinese eatery open up downtown.  The other Yelp reviews were promising so we walked over to check it out with our kids in tow.Loved the spacious outdoor seating- open air large square tables with an umbrella.  Great constant breeze coming from the East River.  Perfect for COVID cautious dining with young kids. Ordered soup dumplings (pork and pork & crab), cucumber salad, hong kong style fried rice, rice dumpling with pork (zongzi / bahzhang / sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaf) and spicy shrimp wontons.Everything was freshly made and steamed to order.  The chilled cucumber salad was excellent- you can tell that they used chinkiang vinegar. Delicious and had a great homemade taste to everything.  Kids were happy.  We will definitely order from here again and visit during the pandemic.",0
We visited The Horny Ramnyc in Midtown East for a delicious outdoor dining experience. The food was amazing - we ordered the Double Smash Burger and Wedge Fries and the M&M Pancake. Both were incredibly delicious and the Brussels Sprouts were cooked to perfection. Our 5 drinks were all excellent as well - we enjoyed Poison Ivy and Pina Fey. We highly recommend this restaurant for a delicious night out!,1
"Stopped by this spot after a comedy show next door and my experience was... alright! Nothing crazy, neither good or bad. If you're an avid ramen eater, I don't think you would like this place. First off when a ramen place is owned by a non-asian person it's already heavily discredited in my opinion. I can appreciate it and their love for ramen but I guess I'm biased. The restaurant itself looks like any other ramen restaurant. Super long. (Anyone else notice this? Why are so many ramen restaurants long?) There's a bar section and also dining tables. We sat at the high top section. The decor is cute, not too obnoxious but definitely Asian-centered which again, a little weird since it's owned by a non-Asian person... lol. We ordered off the online menu that everyone seems to be so entertained by but when you're in the city with slow service due to high traffic/crowds, it's just annoying lol.We got the Tokyo Shoyu, Tokyo Shio, pork buns, curry flower, tofu Coney Island. The ramens were good but not great. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. Broth was subpar and not deep and rich. Also the portion was pretty small... The pork buns were great. Super soft and delicious buns and the pork was cooked and seasoned well. The curry flower was delicious! Such an interesting flavor and texture combo and it just worked. The tofu was also pretty good but a little salty. Overall, I would say the apps stole the show. It was good to finally try this spot but prob won't be craving this spot by any means.",0
"I had a really enjoyable lunch today at this restaurant. The service was great and the food was really good. I especially enjoyed the guacamole and the empanadas. The only downside was that the fluke was a little dry, but overall the meal was really good. I'm definitely going to be back!",1
"The restaurant had quick service, and the dumplings were really good. I didn't expect them to be sticky and steamed, but that's what they were. It made for some sloppy chopstick handling, but that didn't stop me from enjoying them. The sampler was priced at $13.50, and I liked all of the dumplings except for the pork and chive one. I felt like potatoes were inside of it. Overall, the meal filled me up and I was on a schedule.",1
"After walking back and forth in the mobbed marked, we settled on this eatery randomly (by looking at the reasonable lines).It was busy during a Friday lunch hour, but not so badly that there weren't any seats. The wife and I found a spot at the bar next to the dishwasher window. Steam was coming out of it, but it was atmospheric.They have this gimmicky dish, the baked whole cauliflower, that was extremely and surprisingly good. We are going to replicate it when cauliflower is in season!The kebabs/pita sandwiches were fine. Nothing in particular stood out, nor was it anything offensive. Overall, it is a good place to have a meal while in the market. I gave it 3 stars because the value proposition is not good. $10 for a baked cauliflower? You do the math. The pitas were pricey too for the portions and type of meat. I know this is NY, but still.Shout out to the attendant behind the bar; he was very helpful with our additional order of the cauliflower; he took our order instead of having to line up at the cashier again.",0
Cheap eats meal of $5.50!! Good if you need a quick meal. There is also a huge outdoor seating area as well,0
"This review is just for happy hour. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a few of the drinks - $5 each, which isn't always easy to find in nyc! The margarita wasn't the best, but for the price it can be forgiven. Free chips and salsa, which never goes a miss.",0
I ordered a food delivery service to bring this meal. Everything I ordered was very good. I can't comment to the brick and mortar restaurant because I had it delivered to the hotel.,0
"So-ba, so good!! The Azuma Gozen is the perfect option if you are looking for a large set meal of a variety of delicious Japanese favorites including soba or udon noodles, assorted tempura, sashimi, seasonal side dishes, and ice cream or mochi. The cold soba and hot udon are both top notch (plus you can choose from 3 sizes of soba, all for the same price), the tempura is crispy and tasty, the sashimi is fresh and practically melts in your mouth, and the mochi is the ideal way to finish off this fantastic meal. $23.50 for this huge portion of incredible food is a great deal.We also got the Potstickers ($8 for 5), which were good, as well as the Lychee Hi shoshu cocktail ($9), which had a delicious lychee flavor.The staff were super friendly and extremely attentive, ensuring that we were enjoying our meal (we definitely were). The restaurant has standard Japanese decor with ample seating, much of which was available when we arrived.Overall, if you are a fan of soba or Japanese food in general, you must make a visit to Soba Noodle Azuma to get the Azuma Gozen. I guarantee you will leave the restaurant very full and happy!",0
"We recently visited Rathbones Restaurant and found that their prices had increased. Previously, the wing-special price was 0.25 cents a wing, but now the price has increased to $0.44 cents a wing. Additionally, you are now required to purchase a drink before the Wednesday 44-cent wing special is honored. This can make the wait for wings quite long. We would recommend coming here as soon as possible after work or later in the evening when the wait is shorter.",1
"Searching around for restaurants with good xiao long bao around my hotel that was within walking distance, I landed on Noodle Village. After a lot of reviews raving how good their XLB was, and the distance to get to it because of the cold weather, I settled for getting my XLB fix here. So literally, all I ordered was XLB, and that will basically be my whole review.When I got there, it was just opening and I was the first one there to plenty of seating. I got seated on a long table and then ordered my XLB. The ordering process was pretty straight forward. There's not much as far as decor, and it's simple just as it should be. My order comes out, and what's different about these XLB was that I thought it was big on the soup department, but I think they need better wrappers as it was super thin for the dumpling. This causes problems.If it gets stuck on the paper, then you're pretty much screwed and that your dumpling is going to rip along with all of the soup. That was the only sad experience that I had eating XLB here. I think if they just changed to a stronger wrapper it would be fine.When the check came, I was planning on paying with a card, but they asked for cash (obviously, considering I only ordered 2 orders and well...cash is king. But it doesn't help me with my cash back!) Anyways, all in all it wasn't bad, I do wish that they used a sturdier wrapper. But, if you do order this, just be careful!",0
"I highly recommend Rafele for a romantic Italian dinner in the West Village. The food was delicious - we shared buratta as an app, and then got the Spaghetti Frutti de Mare, Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe, Orecchette Friarielli (sausage and broccoli rabe), and the Pizza Rafele. Portions were just right, just enough so were full but still had room to split a tiramisu and chocolate cake! The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night, but we had a reservation so there was no wait for a table. The outdoor parklette is covered, enclosed and has heaters so hopefully they're able to offer ""outdoor"" seating all year long.",1
"I had a great time visiting this restaurant! It was brand new, and I was glad since I've been looking for a good Mexican place in the area. The lunch special includes a drink for $10, so I decided to try that out. I ordered a carnitas quesadilla. It came with so many sauces: 2 kinds of salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole. The food was fresh and hot even though I took it to go. There was a lot of pork in the quesadilla and the muenster cheese was different. The portion was larger than I expected. I would come back and try other items. I saw a lot of people ordering the burrito and tacos. They also offer whole wheat tortilla which I would like to try as well. I'm definitely going to be back!",1
"I had a really wonderful experience at this restaurant! The flavors are really well-combined, and the aesthetic is really pretty. The absolute must-gets here are the aged duck medallions and the buckwheat pastry/tart. They both taste like a unique flavor combination that I was kind of surprised worked, never did I think banana and duck and pesto would be a good combination but somehow they made it work and they made it work well. The buckwheat pastry/tart in particular was so good... it tasted like a s'mores and tiramisu together and it was just heaven in a dessert. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"The first time at Field Good and I didn't know what to get and so I played it safe and I asked the nice girl at the counter to hook me up and that she did.  She gave me a big tray filled to the rim, I saw Boneless Chicken Breast, Sweet Potatoes Mash, Mac & Cheese, Brown Sugar Blondie, Quinoa, Cucumber, and sauce and more stuff in the bottom of my tray for less than $18. They do have other combos and bowls for less that limited to two sides, etc., The chicken was the best part, a well-cooked chared on the skin side and seasoned with to taste. I was thinking I had cornbread but it was more like a brown brownie. Mac&Cheese needed a cheese that has a flavor. Sweet Potatoes where better than OK.I didn't finish it, but I am a Fried Chicken guy so I don't hold that against Fields Good. This place will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood from what I got and the service was really good.",0
"I had a really great experience at Super! The chicken Parmesan was absolutely delicious, and the service was great too - they didn't rush us and were very attentive. The only downside is that it's only cash-only, but they have an ATM inside. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"This is now one of my favorite restaurants after today. Everything we ordered was mouthwatering. 

My grain salad was unbelievable and perfect for the high temperature we were having in NY. I asked for a pouched egg on top. Perfect addition. I never knew that a parsley salad could taste so refreshing. My daughter had the spinach and feta entree that looked like a high end version of a quesadilla as it was made with phyllo. I don't know anyone who doesn't love phyllo - phyllo makes any dish luxurious. The flavor of browned butter was incredible. She added a side of turkey bacon to her dish. It was nice to see the restaurant offer turkey bacon instead of pig bacon. 

I highly recommend the baklava dessert. It was worth the $16. Every penny. And don't forget their turkey coffee with their complimentary little soft cookie.  Coming back!!",1
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good at Priyanka Chopra's restaurant. The service however was not up to par, with our server forgetting our orders multiple times and giving us incorrect desserts. It was also quite slow to get her attention, making the dining experience quite frustrating. The appetizers were all good, with my favorite being the octopus. For main courses, I thought the chicken tikka and lamb briyani were both good but the fish curry was my favorite. The biryani was too salty, and the chicken tikka had too much of a tomato flavor, but the fish curry was really good. The best dish of the night was the jalebi dessert, which was a delicious and refreshing way to end the meal. I don't think I would go back, but if you're curious about modern Indian cuisine, I would recommend giving Priyanka Chopra's restaurant a try.",1
"There's nothing horribly wrong here but Tony's Di Napoli is central casting Italian served in large quantity at breakneck speed in the heart of the still sleeping theater district. It's okay guys it's not 2019 we don't have tickets for Wicked, put the stopwatch away.Touristy joints don't scare me but they usually don't blow me away either. You'll probably leave satisfied with a recollection of meatballs that were way above average. However, not my first choice for Italian by a long shot but if you want to duck in on a rainy Wednesday you might even like it. Oh, and word to the wise, order one entrée for every two people as the portions are freakishly large with pricing to match.",0
Some people say they have great Chinese bbq meats but I found it to be so so. Meat lacked flavor and they skimp on the portion of meat. Overrated and there are better places,0
"Aunt Jake's is ok. The meatball appetizer was good. None of the pastas or sauces really stood out for me, except for the vodka sauce, which was pretty flavorful. The squid ink alle vongole was decent, but I wish it had a more briny taste. I do like that this place allows you to ""build your own"" pasta into any combination.The server was also meh. We asked for bread sticks 4x and each time he said it would be coming out with our food. Nope, they never came and he never bothered asking if we got them. But the couple who came and sat next to us an hour in got some after they asked for it twice.I most likely won't be back as there are other Italian places I'd rather try.",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant based on its convenient location in Midtown West. The food was solid and straightforward, and I would definitely recommend it to others. I had a pad thai which was definitely to my liking. I'm looking forward to trying something else next time I visit.",1
"Split verdict on Mezzaluna.  My wife had a great meal there pre-pandemic.  We were seated in the street side COVID hut.  It was open on one side, but was plexiglass and there was music playing.  The space was very echoic and loud.  There was a waiter's station immediately next to my wife's chair.  The staff would spray disinfectant about 6"" away from her head every five minutes.  After a while, I spoke to the host about it.  He apologized and it stopped.  The chairs were uncomfortable and the small table was lower than usual.  We were started off with some OK bread.  Wine by the glass was OK.  The food almost balanced the dining experience.  The special artichoke salad was very good.  My wife said that the branzino was among the best that she ever had.  My heart said pasta, but my head said healthy, so I ordered salmon.  It was OK, but well done instead of the medium that I requested.  The space was not conducive to lingering.   My wife really liked the food.  I thought that it was OK, but was outweighed by the uncomfortable dining situation.  Would give it another try when we start dining indoors, but I'm not in a rush to go back.",0
I had a terrible experience at Gyu-Kaku - the service was terrible and the hostesses were unapologetic. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,1
"Best bottomless brunch of ever had in terms of value and sophisticated atmosphere. This is not a place you would go to to get eggs Benedict, but rather a good lunch food spot with bottomless food and drinks. We sat upstairs which was key, moving forward I would request this when going back. I was blown away by the extensive drink menu, and the menu period, that was included in the bottomless brunch. It was a whole menu to choose from! The food was hit or miss, I went with a table of 10 and we did a first round of food and found the dishes we liked and ordered a second even third round of those. Dessert was good, we had the chocolate waffles. I'd say biggest critique is that the food sometimes wasn't hot, and if it were hot then it would have been so much better! But, that's what you get at a bottomless brunch spot. Service was great and compared to all others I've been do this was the best. I'd highly recommend to anyone of all ages!",0
"I had a really great time at by Chloe! The food was delicious and really nutritious, and the baked goods were really delicious and soul-satisfying. The only downside is that it can be difficult to order because there are so many options and it's hard to decide which food you want. The wait was also really long, but it was worth it because the food was so good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I finally broke my birria taco virginity today.Originally from Jalisco, the birria craze has since made its way cross-country to New York as of late (with it's first stop in California). The hype is real. Heres to more birria taco with consomme places opening in 2021.I'm so glad I found this truck. Casa Birria does not get as much attention as Birria Landia, but the food here was phenomenal. The woman working the truck was uber friendly and everything was inexpensive and filling.Highly recommend getting the 3 tacos for $10 special along with their consomme. I didn't exactly take note as to what kind of meat was used in their tacos, but I'm pretty sure it was pork.Tacos and consomme were flavorful on their own, but together they were magnificent. I couldn't wait to dig-in, so I devoured everything at the little public seating area next to Shake Shack. Looking forward to trying the other menu items!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The salmon tartare was amazing and the chips that came with it were really good. The steak was also very good - it was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. The only downside is that the cost of the meal was a bit on the high side, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"The food here is always fresh and they always have the noodles separate from the broth so it doesn't get soggy. We love their soups, especially the beef and house social. The beef scallion pancakes are also a great appetizer to share.",1
"Bowery is a beautiful space right next to the Hyatt House. The service was great both times I came, and the food was good, albeit a bit bland. The huevos rancheros for breakfast was much better, and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"I've tried a few dumplings shops in the area and these were not the best. We got the fried dumplings and there was very little filling and it was a little too doughy for me. However, it was only $5 for 10 so I'm not too upset. I've heard you usually get more for $5 at this spot and that the lady constantly changes the price.",0
"I had a great time at Capizzi! The pizzas were delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy, so our wait was about 40 minutes. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"This restaurant is a great place to go with friends. The decor is festive and inviting, and the atmosphere is low-key and more mature than surrounding pubs. The service is prompt, and they got drinks for me and my girlfriends, so this review might be premature. I really enjoyed spending time here, and I'm excited to try out their trivia night next Tuesday. In addition to British fare, they have a variety of dishes, so I'm sure I'll be back to sample them all.",1
"When we arrived, I made eye contact with one of the servers at the counter and she ignored me and proceeded to talk to her co-workers and work on the computer. That's fine because she had something to do but when we walked up to the counter, none of the other 2 people even acknowledged us. The first girl noticed and then helped us get seated. We ordered the trust me for $40. The sashimi tuna was alright but the sauce was overwhelming. The other pieces of sushi has cold fish which I've never experienced at other omakase restaurants. The rice would fall apart. Each piece seemed to be drowned in sauce so much so that the taste of the fish wasn't there. The crab handroll tasted like crab meat with mayo which wasn't what I was hoping for. Another thing that I thought was weird was that towards the middle of the course, I was served my plate of sushi first and then a few minutes later, my boyfriend got his plate. We both got our plates at the same time in the beginning of service so that as strange. I wouldn't recommend Sugarfish for omakase because there are other places that do a decent omakase for $50. If you're really willing to splurge on the experience, sushi nakazawa is the best omakase I've ever had and is worth everything.",0
"Avra is one of my favorite restaurants for Mediterranean and Greek seafood. The grilled octopus is simply the best I've ever had - it's truly amazing. The atmosphere is lively and warm, and the outdoor seating is delightful. The midtown East location is perfect for business occasions. Highly recommended!",1
"Overall, we had a good experience at Winter Beer. The food was good and the prices were reasonable. The service was a bit lacking at times, but it was overall a decent experience. We would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had such a high expectation for this place since so many of my friends recommended. When my group visited the place, it was already packed with the crowds. We were luckily to be seated right away. As we were seated and began to order our food, our waiter was super friendly and welcoming. He was very attentive and precisely explained through our dishes thoroughly. Calamari was just average, I didn't like the sauce though. Their wings were crispy and flavorful. The bun was disappointing since too much of burnt taste literally covered every flavor. And other dishes that we order was pretty good, I especially loved assorted fish roe. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes. However, only reason I'm giving them 3star is that their receptionist was just simply rude. In the beginning our group thought maybe she was overwhelmed with the crowd but, we constantly saw her joking and smiling with other staff but every time we asked her for something or other customer comes in, she had that look in her face and rolled her eyes. I found this very unprofessional and disappointing. I hope they should have trained her better.",0
I came here for lunch with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon since I work nearby. We ordered the two sushi roll (any choice of roll so we ordered the shrimp mango/salmon avocado) lunch special and the pad thai lunch special. Both lunch specials came with miso soup or salad. The sushi rolls were fresh but the mango was not ripe and really sour. The pad thai was a good portion but the sauce was really sweet. The pad thai noodles were cooked well though. Service was fast even during the busy lunch hour. The lunch special wasn't that great of a deal since it was $15-$20 which was pretty expensive for lunch. There are better and cheaper sushi places nearby so I may or may not come back here.,0
Wife and I tried their bottomless brunch with a pulsd voucher. We had an amazing time! The food was good and the bottomless drinks were very fun. We were given a bottle of prosecco with 3 types of juice and they kept it coming as soon as it is empty. The wait staffs were friendly and attentive. No complaints here!,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The pasta dish I ordered (Rotolo) was really unique and delicious. I've never had anything like it before, and it tasted great. It's a great way to support local small businesses, and the price is great too. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Family friendly place with plenty of tables. I got their Meat Lover Pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, bacon, pepperoni, sweet Italian sausage and roasted onions). I found it to be quite cheap, with very little of the toppings listed. Bacon was barely noticeable. Italian sausage almost inexistent. Even the pepperoni were sliced ultra thin. With so many good pizza places in the city, I have no reason to go back.",0
"not quite as much seating as the other location but still very cute on the inside.i came back because bc i wanted those delicious kimchi fries at the other location...unfortunately they said no....literally 30 min after we were halfway done with our meal they go ""oh we have kimchi fries now"" and my heart sank. I was definitely too full to order them....next time!Khao soi and drunken noodles here were good; asked for medium spicy and they ACTUALLY made it spicy!Fried shrimp appetizer was okay; would probably get something else next time (ie the fries)service was very frequent and kind. Hostess was very kind over the phone as well. They take reservations and good for small groups! Would highly recommend this place for a casual night for dinner or a date night.",0
"I went on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait.  Apparently there's usually a line starting around 11am. It's eat-in only, no take-out which kind of sucks that they're turning away a huge base of customers. I had the cha siu rice roll which I thought was pretty good.  The rice roll is thin and silky smooth.  There's nice chunks of thinly sliced tender cha siu which is quite satisfying.  I like how the rice roll is all drenched in soy sauce which was just the right amount of flavor, not too salty/sweet.  The rice roll is definitely better quality than a lot of the chinatown places, but is it worth almost twice the price?  I'm not so sure about that. This won't be my go-to place but I'll come back to indulge myself once in a while.  I hope they do take-out soon!",0
"I stopped by this restaurant after reading the reviews and I have to say, they were right! The soup dumplings were some of the best I've ever had. They're authentically made and come steaming hot and fresh. The staff are so friendly and explained the steaming process to me. The only downside is that they're a bit hard to finish because they're so rich and filling. But overall, I had a really good time here and would definitely recommend checking out this restaurant!",1
"This time I was confused when checking in with the host for my table. Like last time, I got on the waitlist, but instead of getting seated when I got the text saying my table was ready, I got to the restaurant and was told I needed to wait another 20-30 min. I was confused if the yelp waitlist was just another waitlist to get on before the official one? Idk.They opened up a speakeasy on the 3rd floor for us to sit in as we waited. We ended up just staying there because you could order much of the same food as downstairs. We got the nacho belly and spicy charred chicken tapas along with a bulgogi stone bowl. They also honored the check in offer of fruit flavored soju shots. The food itself was tasty. The chicken was really spicy.",0
"We had a great time at Itaewon! The drinks were delicious, the food was good, and the service was great. We would definitely come back and recommend it to others.",1
"Treated myself to the price fixed lunch ($32) here with a co-worker and was impressed foremost by the attentive service and then by the flavors. The tomato salad was great although they seem to skimp on the feta. The dorade has a mild taste, but buttery and delicious. I loved the honey lavender ice cream. If you're a fan of subtle floral notes in your food, you'll want to try this. It paired very well with the walnut cake. While not the most generous, portions were satisfying and tasted excellent!The feel of the restaurant is upscale. You can see the vessel from inside. Try to make a reservation if you plan on trying this place and come during lunch to get the most bang for your buck.",0
"This restaurant is incredible for both eating in and taking out. They have an entire area for outdoor eating and it's so gorgeous. The staff is kind and they all adhere by wearing masks and gloves. We got takeout and it was packaged so well. Also, I've got to say, their butter is incredible. I don't know what they use or how they make it but it's so creamy and spreadable. I normally wouldn't comment on something so basic, but the butter stood out! We ordered the Ragu and the boeuf bourguignon. The Ragu was well cooked and had incredible flavor. The pasta tasted handmade and the dish was overall really fantastic. Perfect portion and great flavor. The beef was outstanding. I'd never tried boeuf bourguignon before. The meat melted in my mouth, I didn't even need to use a knife it was so tender. The veggies were also great and the sauce was flavorful. I thought I would love the Ragu the best because of how much I like pasta but the boeuf bourguignon really blew me away, it was that amazing. I can't wait to come back and have it again! Totally recommend this restaurant for a great atmosphere, delicious butter, and even more incredible main dishes.",0
"Disclaimer: I don't think I ordered the right/most representative Malaysian dishes here. Bek-kopi - 5/5, not as bitter as vietnamese iced coffee. I love how it's in a plastic bag and is easily portable. Milo toast - very generous portion, my husband liked itHainanese chicken - again, very generous portion. The chicken was very tender and juicy and goes well with the sauces provided. Usually the rice is the highlight of the dish for me since it soaks in all the flavors, but something was missing in this chicken and rice combination. I liked the cucumber a lot - it provided a refreshing palate cleanser from all the meat.",0
"Nish Nush is a great place for Mediterranean food. The platter of falafel is a great way to taste a variety of flavors and it's perfect for one or two people. The venue is spacious and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Mediterranean meal.",1
"All the hype I had pretty high expectations for this pie. Ordered delivery, a bit soggy and oily.",0
"I hate to say this but I called it. Since my last 5 star review, quality has massively decreased since Covid restrictions are being lifted. I came here yesterday with my siblings and the rolls are absolutely MASSIVE. Stuffed with rice and crunch to fill you up. The pieces don't even fit in my mouth. Sorely disappointed.",0
"Let's just start off by saying that the food is definitely tasty, as I have ordered in person many times. I have zero complaints in that area. However, the delivery/verification process needs some work. I placed an order via UberEats and when my food arrived I was completely surprised. I ordered fish, shrimp and mac. I received grits and fried lobster tails. After calling my Uber delivery person, he doubled back and provided me a copy of the receipt. I looked at the receipt and see my name however it's the wrong order. Now, I will say this - my name is Ashley and it is extremely common, but that does not excuse not double checking orders. My assumption was that there were two orders placed under the name ""Ashley"" and my delivery guy was given the wrong one. Unfortunately, my guy got another order so he was not able to go back to the restaurant ( he graciously offered). I'm sure they're trying their best to get orders out as covid has limited/eliminated features of their business, but a few extra seconds or another look over the order and Uber confirmation number could have avoided this type of mistake.",0
"Tony's Di Napoli is a central casting Italian restaurant that is unfortunately located in the heart of the still sleeping theater district. While the meatballs were above average, I did not enjoy the experience as much as I had hoped. The prices are also quite high for what you receive. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant, but if you are looking for a touristy joint to duck in on a rainy Wednesday, it might be worth a visit.",1
"I really appreciate the response from the restaurant.  But I can't stress enough my pregnant friend (plus the rest of my party) was standing right there, immensely pregnant, when the exchanges happened. I even mentioned the emergency that caused the missing party was another pregnant friend who almost experienced a miscarriage. The staff seemed robotic and not genuinely interested in what we have to say. At that point, I lost my appetite to argue anymore or use my friend's situation as my point against the policy, nor did we want to keep my pregnant friend standing and waiting, so we left. I get it. It was a busy night. It is a new restaurant. Staff was still getting warm up. But on the flip side, a large chance is that another 8-person party would show up and fill our table while you could just gave us the next 4-person table available. We don't mind waiting for good food. That is why we are there in the first place. But we do mind the lack of empathy in the response and the way the we are addressed. If numbers of people and how much per cover you can charge on one night is what is most important to you, then you have framed this business to only focus on short-sighted gain, instead of building relationship with your guests and establishing loyalty. Policing your guest is not the answer.",0
"Her Name Is Han is a hidden gem near Koreatown, offering key Korean staples in a modernized, upscale environment.

I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything was.

Reservations

We didn't have reservations and it was pretty packed for a weekday.

FOOD

As for food, they offer lunch sets which I highly recommend trying.

It comes with soup, green & potato salad and a variety of small side dishes (tofu, kimchi, etc.) which were all incredibly tasty. We opted for the:

* Han Dumpling ($8)* Slow Cooked Pork Belly ($14)* Garlic Chicken BBQ Lunch Set ($17)* Bibimbap w/ Beef Lunch Set ($18)

I would personally reorder everything other than the dumpling. 

While the dumpling was tasty, I didn't think there was anything special about it, especially at its price point. 

All the meats we tried were tender and aromatic. 

The soup in the lunch set was also a favorite and I enjoyed the broth very much.

SERVICEDishes came out in a reasonable manner but I wouldn't say",1
"I'm a regular at Duke Thai, and I have to say that it's a great Thai restaurant in the Upper West Side and Manhattan in general. The decor is amazing, and it's a great place to socialize with friends, but it's not the best place for romantic or business dining, as the sound can get quite loud. The food is good, and I especially recommend the Pad Thai Bolan and the Krapow Gai Sup (Basil Chicken). The Hoy Dub (Sword clam) used to be good, but since it opened, the amount of clams you get has decreased, so I no longer order it. The Crabmeat Thai Omelet tastes good, but it's largely due to the omelet itself that it is overpriced for a 1-2 pieces of crab meat thrown on top of what would otherwise be a regular Thai omelet dish.",1
"Love that this place is BYOB. We brought several bottles of wine and had a fantastic time. There was no wait on a Saturday night so it made me a little worried that it wasn't popular for a reason. But that assumption was wrong. The food here was great! I don't know what a typical Uruguayan dish is, but the menu seemed a little more Americanized with items like Chicken Milanese. We ordered the sampler platter with fries. It had grilled skirt steak (so flavorful and delish), breaded chicken cutlet, chorizo, corn empanada, tuna empanada and chimichurri. It was plenty for two people! The fries were sea salt and cracked pepper and perfectly crispy. It was super dark in the restaurant, that would be my only complaint. It wasn't conducive for taking pictures so no food pics on this one! But the food and service was great. Remember to BYOB",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was fantastic and the service was wonderful. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great brunch or lunch spot.,1
"The food was surprisingly good at this mid-priced restaurant in Turtle Bay. I would recommend reservations, especially on a weekday, as it can get busy. The waitstaff was great and the service was attentive. My only complaint was the wine I ordered. It was $17 and I felt like it wasn't worth it. I'll be back for the pasta dishes.",1
"Thoroughly disappointed! My Peruvian girlfriend had a yen for ceviche so we tried this place out. We got the basic ceviche with fish and we also got the beef hearts appetizer. The beef hearts were OK but seemed a overcooked to me. It came with a side of corn and fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were completely bland and flavorless. The ceviche was meh. I thought it had way too much lime but my girlfriend, the ceviche expert, said that's how it's supposed to be. She also said the fish should be thicker and raw though. This fish was small cubes and completely cooked. The worst part is after eating a few spoonfuls of ceviche, we found two hairs in the fish!  our waiter, who didn't come to check on us once throughout the meal, was informed of the hairs and took the fish away. We asked for the check instead of another plate of the fish. He said he spoke to the mgr and apologized. Problem is he didn't take the dish off the check! We had to ask for it to be removed! So overall, the food was lackluster with hair in it and the service was subpar. I would not come back!",0
My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ETHIOPIAN RESTAURANT IN NYC!!! Everything taste so flavorful and the service is spectacular! I order from here at least once a week because it's that great!,0
"I ordered delivery from here tonight. Heard they were good. I ordered the buckaroo burger and the vegan carrot cake (no, I'm clearly not vegan). The buckaroo burger had excellent mushrooms and bacon. The cheddar cheese was melted and it arrived warm. The bread was fresh too. The carrot cake was chilled and tasted yummy! I love the icing.  Everything was packaged neatly! No mess. Would've given 5 stars if not for the expensive prices. Can get a delicious burger much cheaper elsewhere. This place is good once in a while for me!",0
"I was really disappointed with my visit to this restaurant. The waitstaff was very accommodating and the atmosphere was charming, but the food was nothing to write home about. I had the steak and eggs and my wife had the chics (I think). Mine was served sandwich style (unexpected but ok) and it was SO bland and too spicy. I love some heat to my food but it needs to be flavorful, not just spicy. The wife's food was no better. Chicken flavorless but cooked well. Biscuit was... odd and again no flavor just heat. The only thing that was slightly enjoyable was the truffle hash browns but WAY too much pepper. $53 wasted - Def will not be back.",1
"I wasn't overly impressed with my experience at Ritual, as both of my items - the Vegetarian Wheel Piada and the 6-piece Wings - were not particularly great. The Vegetarian Wheel Piada was a crusty quiche-like dish with cooked vegetables inside, but the taste was slightly burnt and the flavor was not very strong. The Wings were greasy and needed a lot of help from the hot sauce provided, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, I wasn't particularly thrilled with my lunchtime experience at Ritual and I would recommend trying something else if you're looking for a healthy alternative to pizza.",1
"Penn Station is a great place to get sushi, especially if you're waiting for your train. Penn Sushi is located right near the boarding areas, and the sushi was fresh and tasty. The only downside is that the menu is limited, and the staff wasn't too knowledgeable about the menu. But overall, it's a great option for those looking for sushi on the go.",1
"After having been deprived of a hearty bowl of ramen for so long, Mei Jin was just exactly what I needed. I came here without any reservations on a Sunday night and only had to wait 10 minutes before getting seated for my party of four. I actually spent those 10 minutes looking for parking in the area; there were a few spots open just two blocks away. Service was excellent - we were able to place our order speedily and the menu was available via scanning a QR code on the table. I love how there were wall hooks for our jackets. I was torn between the Chili Beef Ramen and the Spicy Shredded Pork Tonkatsu Ramen, but the shredded pork sounded more interesting so I went with that. I'm happy I chose that since I forgot that I've actually had the Chili Beef Ramen in the past. The broth was so delicious. Too bad I didn't have room to finish all the noodles!",0
"Overpriced hibachi with subpar food, drinks, and service. We waited over 30 minutes to be seated for our reservation.They penny pinch everything! Fried rice is $5 extra, which is insane. When we sat down, they didn't even give us water! We had to flag down our waiter (a 15 minute obstacle) to ask for a liquid that is 60% of the human body and necessary for cell function.Their tricks weren't great, the food tasted very mediocre, and I was disappointed. Save your money and go to Flame on the UWS.",0
"I was really disappointed with the service at this restaurant. It was one of the slowest experiences I've ever had, and the management had to remake our white sangria twice because it was basically just watered down white wine without any fruit. They even admitted that it was bad so we switched it to a red sangria. It was frustrating that it took so long for our food orders to be taken and then another 45 minutes until we saw any dishes arrive at our table. Thankfully, the dishes were pretty good (pulpo, hangar steak, and farro salad with steak). The steak in the salad was a bit tough and difficult to slice, but overall it was a decent meal. I don't think I'll be returning because the service was that bad, even though the food was pretty good.",1
"We had a great time at Bedford & Co's bottomless brunch! The food was delicious and the drinks were great. The staff was friendly and attentive, and we never had to wait long for our drinks. We would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay but nothing special. The ambiance was nice and the service was polite, but the prices were a bit high for lunch. The menu had a nice selection of cocktails if you're interested, and the restaurant was not at all crowded when we arrived.",1
"I'm a sucker for restaurants with beautiful views and Peak did not disappoint. I reserved a spot weeks in advance for a birthday dinner and left a note that it was the guests birthday. Starting with the host, everyone that helped us wished him a happy birthday which was super sweet. Even the elevator ride was top notch with the visuals. As for the food, it was top notch. We ordered the scallops, yellow fin tuna, duo of pork, and duck. The scallops are hands down the best scallops I've ever had. I'm craving them already, I could've had 5 orders of those. Chefs kiss perfection. The yellow fin tuna was also delicious. Packed with flavor and the presentation was on point, definitely can't go wrong with this. The duck and pork were both also incredible. I loved the different sides added to both dishes. Such different and dynamic flavors that all paired beautifully with the main dish, I was not disappointed at all. To finish it off, they served us the donut amuse bouche with a Happy Birthday message. It was the perfect way to end the meal, and it was so good. I do wish we sat next to a window, so maybe that's something you'd have to specifically request. Other than that, I'm so happy with Peak, and would love to come back when my wallet stops crying. Definitely worth it!",0
"Sunday night 6pm on daylight savings so we get a table for 4 with no issues...awesome....good selection of different Japanese dishes including sushi which is ideal for my 10 yr old. So, what are we eating??- Chirashi - comes w/small salad and miso.  Nice selection of fresh sushi. - Samurai (Tonkotsu) Ramen- Wow...delicious. The black garlic in the broth is so complex and tasty. One of best I've had. Good amount of chasu as well. - Mr Smith & Alaskan Roll- rolls are on the larger side so if you aren't that hungry one should so fine. - Kobe beef Don- nicely grilled beef with a slightly spicy sauce. Good stuff. Everything is top notch. Would definitely come back again when in town. One comment- service is a bit on the slow side. Not extremely busy when we were there but things were just on the slow side. Not the usual efficient NYC service, however, everybody is very friendly.",0
"Outdoor dining has been saving these restaurants in which I do appreciate. But going in the PM was not such a good idea. It's October and it's been getting cold so expect to dress up for the occasion. We were seated immediately and looked at the menu online. Everything was kind of expensive here as the ramen starts at $17 -- which is fine because i don't mind supporting businesses but I would rather it be something good. I honestly was hoping that I would be awe'd by the ramen and the cold weather would give it an extra point. But honestly, the cold weather made the ramen less hot and it just went downhill from there. The flavoring wasn't there, it was just bland. The noodles were alright but everything else was just.. not great. We both got the classic and it came with two deli meat thin cut slices of chashu and it was so disappointing. It came with a piece of seaweed and half a soft boiled egg. Honestly, with so much ramen competition in the city, I had expected more from here but unfortunately, this was not my ""cup of ramen"".",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The bottomless brunch was a great way to start our day and the cocktails were delicious. The brunch paella was a huge portion and we would definitely recommend eating it with 3-4 people to make it not feel so heavy. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely come back!",1
"I was disappointed with the food at this restaurant. The ramen was tiny and the duck was dry. The salad was okay, but it didn't taste as good as I expected it to. The bao was also small and didn't have much pork belly. The service was good, but I wouldn't go back.",1
"I visited this restaurant a few times and I have to say that it's not worth the price. The portions are small and the food wasn't that great. I would say it's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I rounded down because it's simply too overpriced for the portion size. I generally get the falafel platter with a mix of falafel and I think it ends up being around $14. They give you some mezze with it - a salad, some couscous, pickled veggies, and a pita, but the whole thing still ends up being smaller than the size of a street cart platter that you could get for five bucks, and isn't THAT much better. I will say that the falafel is exceptional - not too salty, crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful inside despite being on the smaller side. The sides are all just average. I usually order for pickup, and it's rarely ready at the time it says, but they're good about rushing out the order when I'm actually there.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was really cozy and the t-shirts on the wall were really cool. The only downside was that there were only two tables inside, but that's to be expected in New York City. The food was really good and I especially loved the fried spring rolls. The chicken was really crispy and juicy and had a great sauce to go with it. My friend got the Pad Thai with Tofu and he said it was really good too. I would definitely come back here if I'm in East Harlem again!",1
"I had a great time at Anton's! The Angel hair Francese was my favorite dish - it was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. The Roasted heritage chicken was also really good, and the baby potatoes and Flourless Chocolate tart with sour cream were also nice touches. I also liked that the food here is deceptively simple - everything was really flavorful, though uncomplicated in appearance/description. I would definitely come back here! 4.5 stars.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but the cocktails were way too expensive. I would recommend checking out their happy hour specials instead. The atmosphere was great, and the location is perfect for a night out.",1
Love that there is a variety of vegetarian dim sums here. We just got take out from there on Monday and felt like we were legit feasting at home. There are so many dishes I would get again. Their chow fun was also delicious.Would highly recommend checking this place out. I literally have not had so many different types of vegetarian dim sums in my life. Delicious. I can't wait to try it again. :),0
"I had a pretty good experience at this restaurant. They have a good selection of pho, rice dishes and vermicelli dishes. The food came out in a timely manner and the soup was a little oily, but I'm not sure if that was just my bowl because my friend's bowl didn't seem as oily as mine. All in all, the taste was fine.",1
Came here for an early family dinner. Awesome attentive service and real home cooked like pastas. The servings are pretty decent and they give you bread as you wait for your food to come too. There is also good wine and liquor selection to go with your meal if you fancy it.,0
"Overall, South of the Clouds is a good option for a quick meal if you're near NYU. The prices are a bit high, but the food is filling and the service is friendly. The only downside is that the menu outside is not always accurate and the spices can be a bit too intense for some.",1
"A fresh take on Thai cuisine that you should consider if you're on the mid/upper east side. The place is relatively cozy, but not overwhelmingly so. The ambiance is dimmed and private enough that you can have a conversation across the table without shouting at the top of your lungs. It would be good for a casual outing as well as for a date night. Make sure you get your name on the waitlist before you arrive to avoid long wait times. The stand-out features of the menu are the vibrant flavors in each of the dishes.On this occasion, we tried the crepe dumplings, which were a super shareable appetizer that melts in your mouth with a medley of textures and flavors - the crunchy nuts, soft dumpling shells, sweet sauce and meaty filling. It was a cool start, and even better when accompanied with a Lychee Thai Iced Tea :) For mains, we tried the chef's specialties that were crispy duck themed - a duck salad and duck prig pao, both from the page-long list of ""chef's specialties."" We wanted to try something we wouldn't be able to experience at other restaurants, and we were *not* disappointed...For under $20 per plate, you are getting a legitimate meal that will leave you pleasantly full and satisfied with diverse flavors that work well in combination. The duck was excellently prepared in both entrees, melting in your mouth with a gentle crisp on the skin, just like you might expect. But accompanying the duck, on the salad (for example) you are getting sweet tones from the apple and pineapple bites, herbal notes from the mint, vegetable profiles and textures from the tomatoes, fresh cucumber, and red onion, and the perfect addition of acidity from the vinaigrette. Each bite had something to offer. It makes for an exciting dining experience.  There are many places in NYC worth eating at, but Up Thai can justifiably be on any flavor-seeker's list.",0
"Had a girl's night dinner at this Harlem destination spot across from Fairway's in no mans land on 12th Avenue and 133rd Street.  The grilled salmon and coconut shrimp was a good combo with a sauce that matched perfectly.  It was a little too salty in spots though.  My friend's curry goat had an authentic Jamaican kick.  The fried snapper was a great presentation but fried so much, the fish was overpowered by all that crispiness.  It needed the mild sauce that accompanied it to contrast all the fried batter. The happy hour cocktails were a great deal at $8 but we should've ordered from the bar menu as the chicken wings looked amazing.  Next time and there will be a next time.",0
"This was an excellent experience - no wait on a Friday afternoon! The curry puffs, beef buns, chicken pad Thai and Thai iced tea were all excellent. The highlight was the beef buns, which were cooked to perfection. Service was quick, and I will definitely be returning!",1
"Overall, I had a pretty decent experience at this restaurant. The pastries were fresh and the breakfast sandwiches were solid. However, it seems like there are a few of these locations and I have had good experiences at each of them. I know the reviews are negative but my experience wasn't nearly as bad. So if you're looking for a convenient place to get breakfast, I suggest checking out this place.",1
"Second time here and this time we came in a larger group on a weekday! I've always thought Lido is a little expensive thus the four stars, but their service is always top notch. Interior - they still got outside seating during the winter and its perfectly heated! Make sure to make a reservation during the weekend, they get busy.Service - though there were barely any customer cuz it's a random Tuesday during lunch, our server was delightful and helped us with separating the check, getting all different orders very efficiently.Taste - their winter menu is a bit small for brunch, and since i didn't want their signature French toast (which is delicious btw!), I went with the sausage omelette. It's great portion, comes with greens and the perfect ratio of toppings to eggs. Overall, I will always come back to lido for its amazing service. Thanks for making my day!",0
"Came on a Thursday night with a Bachelorette party. The place was pretty empty and we got seated right away. We started off with drinks, guac, and empanadas. The empanadas were stuff with plantain and was VERY good. The guac came with a lot of chips and was pretty good. While ordered we discovered that they were out of passion fruit and couldn't order passion fruit margaritas. While I ordered sangria, everyone else at the table got a variety of margaritas. I tasted one and it was very strong, not particularly my favorite but everyone else loved them. For entrees we got the ""tour de tacos"" and they were pretty good. We also got street corn off the cob and the tacos came with rice and beans. The street corn was amazing but the beans looked to be very mushy and old and the rice had no flavor. The service was very good and we got free prickly pear shots for checking into Yelp as well as glasses of champagne at the end since we were celebrating a bachelorette. All in all, come because it's great for groups and drinks are good. The food was just okay. Places like agave in the city I felt was better.",0
"When we came here it looked like we were one of the only tables, but the service was still pretty slow. We probably waited about 15 minutes for them to come back around and take our order. After that, they did bring us some fried beet kofta on the house which was actually quite tasty.  I ordered the butter chicken which was a bit dry and not the most tender. I also did not realize until the check came that the rice was an additional charge not included with the entree, which seemed a bit tricky to me, as the overall price with rice was more than I would have been willing to pay.",0
"Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, and the service was great. However, the prices are a bit high, so be prepared to spend a bit of money here. Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out this place if you're in the area!",1
"I had a great time at this vegetarian restaurant! I loved all the dishes we ordered. The wait is long though on a Saturday night, it'd be good to get a number and estimated time there first and then stroll to the nearby bakery/bubble tea places to hang out before coming back.",1
"Two Boots is a great place for vegan and meat-free pizza lovers. I got the ""V for Vegan"" slice, and it was delicious. The vegan cheese was really flavorful, and the artichokes, onions, and red pepper sauce made it taste like a real pizza. My friend also enjoyed his pizza, and the chili pepper flakes added a good amount of spice. Overall, we had a great time at Two Boots, and we would definitely come back again.",1
I came here for a drink after dinner and was happy with the experience. You ride an elevator up to the roof and there are lots of tables and open area for talking. I think this place is great to grab a cocktail and talk for an hour or two. I liked the forest-y vibes and overall ambiance.,0
Nice outdoor seating area that felt a lot more like it belonged than some of these bus lane setups. First of all bc it wasn't in a bus lane it felt more like an actual restaurant experience! The servers seemed happy too. Food was good customer service was great.,0
This is a great Korean restaurant that doesn't make non Korean speakers feel left out. We tried the Yelp waitlist for the first time and it was good. A little wait but accurate of the wait time. The meat was tender and the waitress was friendly and also helped out with the cooking. I really liked their yummy cocktails. We had Lychee Soju Cocktail and Frozen Mango Bomb. I wished it was Shapiro beer instead of Coors. We ordered the marinated beef platter for two and green tea cold noodles. All good and price is according to the area. Nice decor with a feel like a night Asian market.,1
"Beautiful panoramic views, and they're able to accommodate large groups! Was here for a boozy AYCD brunch for some friends' engagement party, and had a good time. They could've been quicker with the drink refills, but were also housing them mimosas. I was incredibly hungover, so being in the hot sun wasn't great, but that was just because were in the corner where there wasn't as much covering.",0
"The Trinity Restaurant is a great place to go for a casual meal. The interior is very clean and well done, and the staff is pleasant and happy. The prices are fair, and I recommend the trinity and the spinach and artichokes dish. The portion and taste were both nice, and it's in the Broadway theater area, so it's a great spot for parties.",1
"I've come back several times since my first mediocre review and honestly this place is now one of my favorites! That first time I was disappointed must have been a fluke. Every time after that has been a hit. The pepperoni grandma slice is one of the best in this city- ultra crispy dough, thick cut pepperoni, hot out the oven. Totally worth the long lines.",0
"The Wren is the best bar/restaurant around! The coziest thing you can think of is a warm bed in a cold room, and the Wren nails it. Came for lunch with a friend, and the bartender told us to sit wherever. We parked ourselves in the back and shared a French press coffee. He got a grilled cheese and tomato soup, which I tried and loved. It was so creamy and comforting. He also had a beer. I got the roasted chicken salad, which was so hearty, healthy, and filling! It has cotija cheese, avocado, jalapeno, and lettuce. They skimp on nothing, and it's well worth the price. Everything came so quickly, yet was very fresh. Service is efficient, and interrupts you minimally. Prices are beyond affordable, especially for the area. The Wren is all-around dreamy, and the rustic vibe makes it hard to leave. Recommend you go for brunch, an event, dinner, or drinks!",1
"Xi'an Famous Foods is an amazing restaurant! The food is some of the best we've had on our trip and the service is great too. The only downside is that there's not a lot of seating, but that doesn't really bother us. The dishes are really good and you can't go wrong with any of them. The only thing I would say is that the food can be a bit oily, but other than that, it's perfect!",1
"Honestly food just okay and prices were high, but worth trying at least once. The restaurant is super cute and in a niche, fancy Chelsea neighborhood. People definitely come dressed to the nines, tourists and locals alike (although there are noticeably less locals here than in other establishments in the area). Note: when they mean ""roll"", we thought it meant sandwich roll, but it actually means sushi roll! The shakshuka entree here actually was a decent amount of food that tasted fine, but the M.A.C. sushi roll we got was so expensive and the sushi rice was already hard. However, pics here are cute, and it's fun to come for Restaurant Week dinners for a slightly discounted price compared to normal!",0
"Up Thai is a great place for a casual lunch. The atmosphere is pleasant and the decorations are pretty. I really liked the selection of appetizers and entrees that were available. My friend opted for the soup, dumplings, and Pad Khing dish, and she said it was very flavorful. I recently started eating gluten-free, so I ordered the salad without any dressing. The salad was good, but I was disappointed that there was a rotten lettuce leaf in it. The portions were really large, and we ended up taking home a lot of leftovers. I would definitely recommend Up Thai to anyone looking for a affordable and convenient lunch option.",1
I absolutely love Marinara Pizza UWS! Their cauliflower pizza is delicious - can't even tell it's cauliflower. Their chicken parm roll is also great - always hot and fresh. The service can be slow at times but would recommend them any day!,1
"Overall, I thought the food was good. The shrimp crab well put together, it's good  let them cool down for about 2-3 min if you are dining in Duck. The duck sticky texture it's like a scramble egg inside I didn't like my fiancé gave them a 6. The food was ok. The service amazing. The establishment clean and decent. The napkins thick Silverware beautiful.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at Lobster Place! The oysters were fresh and delicious, and the service was great. It was definitely a busy place, but the staff handled it well. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent at this restaurant. The hot pot materials were of acceptable quality, but it really put me off that when we picked fish balls or anything for a party of 4 people they literally would bring 4 fish balls at a time. As an ice cream lover, I did love the free reign on what must have been dozens of flavor free for me to self scoop with side of poki sticks. Personal fan of their matcha and grape seed flavors and think this is a rather generous perk.

However, things to note include the 1 hour and 40 min limit to the ""unlimited buffet,"" if you come on a Saturday night it's relatively empty around 6/6:30 but expect to wait long lines to be seated post 7pm. Best to make reservations, and also soft drinks are part of the deal but beer ran ~$3 a bottle so still a steal.",1
"The waitstaff were severely understaffed and struggling to even bring water within 20 min. Of course not their fault, but that was the scene. Their manager needs to pull through. The crowd was mostly slurring and Murray Hill Bros (have they migrated to West Village somehow?) Place stinks of wet dog. I guess that's what a fondue room is like on such mass scale of cheese. I make a lot of fondue at home and the fondue itself was fine, but overpriced. Wine - too expensive $28/glass is too much.",1
"Serra by Birreria is a beautiful rooftop restaurant / bar on top of Eataly. I've had pasta and drinks here previously, which were great. This afternoon, they had the roof closed but it was not air conditioned and was extremely hot with just fans blowing around the hot air. My friend and I ordered dessert, which were quite small. Considering the price, I'd expected something larger or fancier, but the Pannacotta ($12+) was a nice dessert. I would recommend coming here when it's not too hot, so you can actually enjoy the lovely atmosphere.",1
"Cash only. The pizza was good, but not great. Lacking a bit of flavor and the sauce was a bit too loose so it made the pizza dough droop in the center. The crust was also a bit burnt. The spaghetti limone is divine and absolutely worth trying! The gnocchi are also good, very light and tasty, though the tomato sauce they came with was a bit too sweet for my liking.",0
"I'm a sucker for a good hamburger, and this place definitely didn't disappoint. The shrimp was especially amazing - the garlic chili sauce really made it taste great. I also really enjoyed the duck dish - it was a great protein alternative to steak. However, the dishes don't really have great names - they're just descriptions of what's in them. All in all, a great place to stop by if you're staying at the MADE hotel.",1
"I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Truck from Mealpal, and it was very disappointing. The shrimp was very, very soggy and cold already, and the rice was also cold. The portions align with Mealpal prices, but for a regular order/cost ($10-12ish), I would not be satisfied paying this amount for only four pieces of shrimp and a scoop of rice. The shrimp seasoning, however, was so delicious. I'm conflicted about how I feel about this meal.",1
"This place was right across from my new apartment, so I'd figure I'd give them a try. I got the combo of 10 pork potsticker and a pint Lo Mein which came to about $10 with tax. Super cheap and affordable if you ask me. Good quantity and size. But with this kind of pricing, don't expect outstanding quality.The dumplings I have no issues with and would be happy to order them again when I need something quick right across the street. The Lo Mein on the other hand was super peppery in taste. Simply over powered with pepper where I really couldn't enjoy it like I would like to.",0
"Bowllin' is just about a minute walk from Washington square park, and as you walk in, you're greeted with a cute interior seating area. The cafe styled interior is actually beautifully designed, and is pretty welcoming. Though the food is Korean, the menu is pretty easy to understand and is thoroughly explained for anybody who is unfamiliar with Korean food.I got my food to go, and customized a bowl (they have a lot of options from poke to bulgogi to ""sweet chili chicken"" (which I ordered) along with different additives like egg and avocado.The pricing is pretty good for the area, most of the bowls are around $12. The food was decent, however I felt that the sweet chili chicken was quite bland. Though in the bowl the rice was completely covered in the sauce, I did not feel that the sauce or the chicken was spicy at all.",0
"Came to pilot on a Sunday evening to watch the sun set over the NYC skyline. The boat itself is so cute, and there are some great phot angled on the top and back of boat. I appreciated they could our party number change from 4 to 5 last minute. We ordered some mock tails and I got the Tropicana cocktail which was good but not very strong. The gin and champagne cocktail, forget the name, tasted exactly like a mimosa and I wasn't too impressed with it. We ordered the luster platter which was a sampler of alltheir different oysters for $70, and you get 2 dozen. Fiscally, it's the best bang for your buck and they were SO GOOD! Comes with a trio of sauces too and we were all pleased. Also got the fries- they taste like McDonald's fries but without the added grease and shame. The aoli for dipping was good but the ketchup kinda weird it has some additives. For $8 the portion isn't grand but hey it's NYC. We also got the ceviche which was an explosion of flavor. Loved it. The best part was our waitress- Jennifer maybe? She took pictures for us, was so sweet and knowledgeable on the menu and even managed to time the oysters to come out right when our last friend joined us after his work call- she knew he was on the pier and kept an eye out for when he was done and walking down. VERY ATTENTIVE. I'm so sorry I can't remember her name but we were the table off 5 with a 5 pm reservation on Sunday the 24th! Woukd definitely come back.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The calamari was tender and the fried chicken was delicious - skin was very thin but crispy and meat was very tender. I also highly recommend the ssam platter as it's very filling and so delicious. The portion size was just right for 3 people. The only downside is that the food came very slow, but I would definitely come back here to try more food.",1
"I came to Flame for sushi, but I was disappointed with the non-hibachi menu. The service was great, but the sushi wasn't up to par. I would recommend going with Hibachi, but not the sushi.",1
"The food was okay, but the service was confusing and communication was lacking. I stumbled upon this place when my friends and I were on a search for lunch and saw there were seats available. We each ordered a bowl of noodles and a bunch of appetizers. My bowl of spicy ramen was tasty and mildly spicy. The popcorn chicken was a bit bland but crispy. The fried chicken was better. Cold cucumbers were refreshing. Overall, a decent lunch.",1
"My boyfriend and I had a reservation at peak dinner time for a Saturday night and this place was packed. Super low key and casual spot with amazing pizzas and pastas. The service here is quick and efficient, although the pizzas typically take a little longer than the pastas to come out. We got the vodka rigatoni and gnocchi to start, followed by a large tie dye pizza and the olive oil cake to finish. The pastas were delicious and fresh, I really liked the texture of the gnocchi and would definitely get it again. The vodka rigatoni wasn't as creamy as I would have liked but it was good nonetheless. The pizza was the star of the night - the vodka/tomato sauce, pesto, and fresh mozzarella paired incredibly with the crispy crust with every bite. I would highly recommend getting the tie dye pizza, it's one of the more unique types of pies you'll find in a city full of pizza. I've had a handful of olive oil cakes and this one was a little more of a bread/loaf than cake, I would try a different desert next time. Overall fantastic spot and I cannot wait to return!",0
"I've been hoping to come here for some time as Atoboyo has gained a reputation for being one of the top modern Korean restaurants in the city. The restaurant is small but has a cool, hip, urban vibe. I came here with a group of 6 which was a squeeze at the table but overall was a good move - the way the menu designed is it can be either done as an individual pre fixe ($75/person for 5 courses) or if you're a bigger group you can get the menu for the table and try everything.  There were a number of standouts from the menu. I really enjoyed the octopus, the pork belly, and *especially* the fried chicken. The fried chicken is a supplement but GET IT. It's sooo worth it - perfectly crispy and tender with delicious peanut and spicy dipping sauces. Dishes I was less impressed by was the donut starter and the wagyu (really needed more seasoning and the the raw mushrooms weren't a great addition). Overall however, there were many interesting dishes and it's a great bang for your buck. The other disappointment for me was that the alcohol menu was limited to wine and beer but a nice cocktail could have really changed the game. I can definitely see how Atoboy has gained such popularity. It's a fun and surprisingly casual spot for a group with a interesting and unique menu. I would recommend trying it out if you're in the mood for modern Korean!",0
"Joe's pizza is worth the hype! The service is fast and prices are reasonable ($3 for a slice of cheese). I came here at like 1am pretty much every day I was in NY lol, easy and delicious!",0
"Wow, what is going on with the bartenders here? I came by on a Saturday afternoon/early evening and the place was full but not overcrowded. A group of us sat at the bar to celebrate a friend's birthday. The 3 female bartenders were rude to a point where we were not sure how to respond to them, but they honestly were acting like they were working a sports bar and were 3 hours into a game and had been dealing with out of control drunk sports fans all day. However, they HAD NOT so there was no reason for their behavior. I thought Jack and Fanny's was a chill place, but don't come looking to relax and grab a drink because once you interact with a bartender there you will feel like an asshole for even just ordering one.

They were pretty consistently moving around the bar talking/CLEARLY bitching about patrons while facing other patrons. How is this appropriate? I also heard them get into two altercations not worth getting into - one was after a patron ordered a drink 2 times with one bartender and she didn't bring it over, he finally asked the other bartender. She didn't bring it either, so he asked the original, and the original one just goes ""I'll bring",1
Lokal was a bit disappointing. Started with delicious dips (the baba ganoush is so good!) and cocktails. Unfortunately the rest of our dishes were not as good. The gambas (sautéed shrimp) were over cooked and bland. Grilled octopus was a very tiny amount of actual octopus over a salad. Neither were worth the price at all. The avocado and tomato salad was okay but a little bland.Service was great at the beginning but we never were offered more drinks and had to ask for the check after sitting for more than 10 minutes after they cleared our plates.,0
"Solid spot for happy hour, but keep away for food - wings and arancini were both a big miss. The wings were small and cold, and the dipping sauce was weird - unidentifiable and not tasty. The arancini were also teeny, and unfortunately I couldn't even finish one. Worth checking out for drinks though!",1
"I absolutely loved this sushi restaurant! The experience of watching the sushi master make the sushi was really enjoyable and fun. The price for the omakase course was great and the sushi was really fresh. I also loved that they have a lunch option that is affordable and comes with a lot of sushi. Overall, I highly recommend this spot for a fun and delicious dining experience!",1
"We came here on a Sunday for brunch as a group of three, and were seated at the bar. The cafe is pretty cute, but the wait for our food was really long. Food and prices were on par with other Manhattan brunch places. Probably would not come back based on this experience.",0
"They have a $3 off a $5+ order offer on Seamless so I decided to try out this new place near work but it was so disappointing. I got a chicken ricotta and a buffalo chicken slice and they both tasted like cardboard. Either they've been sitting out or left in the oven for too long because both slices were completely dry and flavorless. The cheese on top was all dried up and not stringy at all. It kind of reminded me of the cafeteria pizza that we were served back in elementary school...no bueno. The workers handling the food were all wearing masks but the cashier was not...Yep, don't think I'll be back since Pizza Park and Famous Famiglia are a block away.",0
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The service was great and the atmosphere was very charming. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a special brunch experience. The prices are a bit high, but the food is worth it. I especially loved the caramelized bananas on my french toast.",1
"Zia Maria Chelsea is a great spot for a classic Italian meal in Chelsea. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable, and the service is friendly and accommodating. Our salads and pizzas were delicious, and the spaghetti pomodoro was perfectly cooked. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal in a relaxed and comfortable setting.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! It's all vegan, and the menu has a lot of variety, including some really delicious-looking burgers. Plus, the prices are really reasonable. The atmosphere is really comfortable and inviting, and the service was great. I especially loved the booths - they make you feel really at home. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a vegan-friendly restaurant with great food and prices.",1
"I want to first start by saying this is a review for Catch NYC (which serves seafood) not Catch Steak (which serves steak). Apparently it's an everyday thing that patrons are confusing the establishments and find themselves walking to the wrong location like my date and I did yesterday lol. Thankfully the locations are in walking distance of each other! Anyway we had a really good time at Catch NYC. Thank you to the g.o.a.t. waiter DON who was really friendly and attentive. What we ordered: the Truffle Sashimi which consisted of tuna and hamachi slices, the sauce was delicious; the catch roll which was salmon on the roll was cooked table side; grilled Spanish octopus (I am not the biggest octopus fan but this turned out to be amazing); the wagyu also cooked table side (warning the establishment charges by the oz $$$$); crispy shrimp and the sautéed wild caught snapper which came with lobster mash, truffle purée, and a lemon brown butter sauce it was delicious! Final thoughts: I'd come back to the other dishes on the menu since everything was so good. The lighting of the establishment is a bit hard on the eyes because it's so dim, maybe the restaurant could adjust that.",0
"Bistro Burger: 4 stars, everything else was 3 stars. I wasn't expecting such a no-frills burger in this seemingly frilly restaurant. Squeezing through the dimly lit, jam packed, bar area on Friday night, my group of three was led to a table in the back after a short wait.The concise food menu is pinned on the wall, a seperate drink menu hung in similar fashion. The beer is affordable for the area. I got a Lagunitas IPA for $5.75, but there are cheaper options still. My dad ordered a Bud Light, but was served (and charged for) a Beer of the Month. I decided on the Bistro Burger($12.75); a thiccc beef patty, American cheese, and somewhat crispy bacon. Fries ($3.95) are not included, but are offered by the servers as if they were. While the burger was well worth it's price tag, the fries were dry and bland. My boyfriend was not in a beef-eating mood so he decided on the Bistro Bello, no cheese ($10.75). He was very disappointed by the preparation of the two mushroom caps, which were barely grilled. Upon biting into them, they released a lot of fluid which ruined the bun. He had to fork & knife the rest. Of course the focus at the Bistro is the beef, but in an era of more people seeking meat alternatives, this felt like a  glaring afterthought.",0
"their menu is interesting, but i have never enjoyed the food. EVER. the Margs are tasty, but every experience i have had at Dos Caminos (and the two other locations in NYC i've been to) have been disappointing. $29 for GUAC?? yo, i know Guac is always ""extra""... but charging me that price for smashed avocados (and you're not even smashing it in front of me and giving us a show!!!) is out of this world crazy. this one time (at Park Avenue location), i ordered the Ceviche Sampler and the fish was old, slimy, stinky and inedible. i told our server that it was AWFUL. he asked me, then what do i want, then? i told the server that he should go back to the kitchen and advise the cooks not to serve this to customers because it's old and i almost threw up from the smell. the server grabbed the dish from me and didn't return to our table as everyone at the table already got their entrees. and guess what? the ceviche was on our check. your drinks are well decorated and fun, but I'm not a fan of Dos Caminos.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant after seeing a Broadway play. The escargot was delicious, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The steak with fries was also very good. The only downside was that the dessert wasn't particularly memorable. But overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend it. The interior is also very beautiful.",1
"A three star review because whoever was working the bar when we first sat down was not attentive. The bartenders switched out and it was like night and day. Closer to a five star experience when the staff switched out. When we first sat down, we waited at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged by anyone at the bar. The bartender served four parties who sat down after us before they even offered us water. We had to flag down a bartender and asked if we could order a few drinks. He looked shocked that we even asked and responded , ""Sure, but I'm not in charge of this section."" This may have been true, but a more polite and appropriate response could have been, ""I'm not in charge of this section but I'll make surge to flag down someone to take care of you."" After 20 - 30 minutes, we finally ordered two cocktails.The wait staff switched out and we had a lovely experience with the bartender that was in charge of our section. He was attentive and had a good sense of humor. We didn't try any food because we had dinner reservations elsewhere. The drinks were good. The sangria was tasty. Service is hit or miss.",0
"The vibe and ambience of this place is really nice. However, that was probably my favorite part. The menu is not very extensive and the food is average. The spicy pepper and walnut dip wasn't spicy and needed more flavor. The chip to dip ratio was also off and there was too much dip. A waiter offered to bring us more chips but never came. I got the chicken shashlik which was also average. The chicken was burnt in many places which im not a fan of and the rice was pretty flavorless too. The drinks were decent but the service was pretty slow. Overall, i probably won't be coming back here.",0
"Pricey pizza, but I guess we're in nyc so it's not surprising. This was on my list of places I've wanted to try for a long time. Came here today a Monday at 5:15pm and there was no wait for a party of 2. We ordered half tie-dye and half hot honey. Both were good and I love how thin the crust was. We ordered the large (18 in) and we were stuffed. When we were heading out around 6:30pm I heard it was an hour wait for a party of 4 so I recommend going early or very late to avoid the wait if you don't have a reservation.",0
My first time here. Its on the 2nd floor so you have to get a set of steps to get to the restaurant. I was actually just here with co workers to pick up a large order so I didn't actually eat here. I did get a chance to peek at the set up though. Decent sized space for a restaurant. Seems like it is an old town house. There's a bar right by the entrance and there were plenty of tables. I'm not positive but I want to say there was an outdoor seating area in the back?Our order was all there but they didn't mark down what each dish was which I think should be standard with large orders. The food was good but very spicy. I actually like spicy food so it wasn't an issue for me. I'll be back again.,0
"Walked by here dozens of times, but never tried it. I was looking forward to coming in since it always appears on yelp as a happy hour spot in the neighborhood.  The website and yelp show their happy hour ending at 7pm on weekdays. I got here at 6:40pm, hoping to grab a seat and some drinks from the HH menu.  Unfortunately, the hostess told me they stop seating for HH at 6:30pm as shown in the sign at the podium.  That's a really strange policy since most places will often extend or let you order from the HH menu even if you're seated right at the end of the hour. Either way, we requested to be seated for drinks and some apps.  I would have been more impressed if the food and service made up for the abbreviated HH. However we were seated at a table where we had to ask for silverware, napkins, etc. piecemeal.  Nothing was set on the table for us, even after we ordered.  Maybe the server was tired or having a bad day, but her lack of care didn't help our poor impression of this place. Drinks and fish and chips were ok -- the fries were the best part of the evening. Those were legit.  Not sure I would come back here though.",0
"I absolutely loved my experience at this restaurant! The lady who worked here was so nice and welcoming and the food was absolutely delicious. She gave us free dumplings on the house and the steamed egg was also free, which was a really nice touch. Overall, I had a really great time and would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was top-notch. The pork belly bun was my favorite dish - it was so good I could not resist ordering it again. The nabe yaki udon was also delicious, and the shrimp tempura was a nice touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I really enjoyed the watermelon dole whip soft serve ice cream at this restaurant. It was quite refreshing and smooth, with a mellow watermelon flavor. It didn't taste as tart as I liked, and turned a bit artificial after a few bites. The size was great, and it was quite delicious. I had their like bowls before, and they're definitely a great balance and delicious.",1
I've done plenty of take out from here both pre-covid and after. Food gets prepared quick and the noodles are separated from the broth so it doesn't get soggy. We really like the noodles soups here (with hand cut noodles) - the beef and the house social are our go to. We also really like the beef scallion pancakes which are a great appetizer to share.,0
"We found Gelso and Grand when we were walking thru Little Italy. 

The drinks were nice. We were seated quicker than they had estimated. Our waiter was nice but a little slow with waters. We got 2 pastas and sampled on each Others. Both were tasty. I liked the pesto a little better as my cacio e Pepe had a little more pepper on it than I like. It was still good though. It seemed much more modern inside compared to a lot of the other restaurants that you walk by in little Italy. I'd eat here again if I was in the area.",1
Came here for Friday brunch and waited around an hour to get seatedPros:- Good food at good prices - favorites are the banana walnut pancakes and chicken n waffles- Friendly staff but you do need to flag them down since they're so busyCons:- The food is good but not that great to justify the long wait time- Single stall coed bathroom - really long lines,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The design is really cool and inviting, and the outdoor patio area is really nice. The drinks menu is really good, and the staff was really friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",1
"I stopped by this Indian restaurant for lunch and it was a great experience. The space is large and nicely decorated, and the buffet had a lot of great options. The food was delicious and took a little while to arrive, but the tandoori chicken was really good. The service was great, and I would definitely recommend this spot.",1
"I ordered this as a Uber eat delivery during quarantine and I have to say the desserts came perfect. All the desserts were spot on. I ordered the matcha lava cake that was a delectable blend of chocolate and green tea. In the lava cake, there was a gooey warm chocolate filling and the ice cream complemented the cake perfectly. We also ordered chocolate chip cookies which were huge and soft and gooey. They were amazing. We also got (I don't remember the name) a dessert that had cornflakes and was flakey. It was delicious. I could eat that everyday. I can't wait to try this place in person but for delivery it was amazing.",0
"This place is on the newer side. They are on the Concourse level of Rockefeller Center. Korean themed take away place with a pretty good menu. Everything is pre made in take away containers but they do have seating so you can grab it to go or eat there. They also have frozen dumplings, bulgogi, and more in a freezer that you can take to go as well. Service was quick and good and I thought the food was good. So far I've had the sweet and spicy chicken bowl and the spicy pork bowl. I thought both were good. The chicken bowl was $10 and the spicy pork was $14. Not bad price wise considering the location. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu too. Good lunch option.",0
"Delicious. Got the korean style fried chicken sandwich. Super crispy chicken with a sweet and spicy sauce w aioli and pickles w a Korean slaw on a soft potato roll. LOVED the pickled radishes on the side, which were a great palate cleanser for the flavor bomb of a sandwich.To the poor waiter, I'm so sorry I reflexively hit no tip because I'm so used to ordering take out! I will come back and make it up to you, I promise.",0
"Rubirosa delivers on its promise of delicious pizza. The crust is perfect - thin and crispy with a great sauce to dough ratio. The tie dye and honey pie we ordered were both delicious, and the arugula salad was refreshing. We would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good pizza fix.",1
"I absolutely loved dining at AYCE! The value was unbeatable and the selection of meat was great. The only downside was that I didn't see everything that I wanted to, but that's to be expected with such a large selection. The bathroom was also very clean, which is always a plus. Overall, I would highly recommend AYCE!",1
"Da Claudio is a great restaurant with delicious food. The shrimp with head-on is my favorite dish, andJuliana, the waitress, is very friendly and attentive. The calamari app includes some fish, so you can try a variety of dishes. I had the black linguini with shrimp and it was mouth-watering. My friend liked her salmon dish, and she said she's been here before and liked the food the last time she was here too. Overall, this is a great restaurant with great food and great service. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",1
"I don't eat pizza often, but my friend was craving it, so we searched for a place that had vegan, meat and gluten free crusts options. This led us to Two Boots. I got a ""V for Vegan"" slice, and my friend got a small gluten free pepperoni pizza. I really loved my vegan pizza, and the creativity that went into it: artichokes, onions, red pepper sauce and authentic ""cheese tasting"" vegan cheese  (or maybe I forgot what real cheese tastes like). My friend loved his pizza too. We sprinkled chili pepper flakes on our pizzas which added flavor but not enough spice -- wish they had a bottle of hot sauce for those of us that need to feel a little burn every time we eat. Overall we loved Two Boots and would definitely come back next time we are in NYC.",0
"I visited Midwest Munching for dinner and was impressed! The huge ass bulgogi fries were my favorite dish - they were so crispy and delicious! The beef set I ordered also included tenderloin, brisket, and ribeye, and it was all very delicious. The only downside was that the meat was a bit dry, but that's to be expected with grilling outside. Overall, I had a great meal at Midwest Munching and would definitely recommend it!",1
"UPDATED REVIEWSo we came back to give Tang a try.service. So we arrived today with a reservation. They had a line and a group got fussy so they gave our original table to them and offered us another table. But due to our inconvenience, they got us a rounds of drinks for free. Good job already. They also took care of our soup. Tang soup is not your typical watered down Hotpot. Their broth is top notch full flavored. It's good to have a Hotpot restaurant that can provide authentic mala for people like me that chases that flavor. I also notice they changed their portions of the food they served. Nothing was small. Big portions and quality was on point. This is how improvements should be made. I also got a change to speak with their manager Li, and I did mention what happened to me when I came here first time. He did apologize and said that case was put into careful consideration and improvements have been made. Way to go!!! Good job  because it was definitely noticeable. All the servers were very friendly. Plates were changed all the time, water or sauce was refilled. We also did not get rushed, since this is not AYCE, and we keep adding to our order. Top notch service and everyone on point. This is how to keep improving and having customers come back. I will definitely recommend!!! 5",0
Au Cheval is a great place to go for a burger. The fries are also great and the garlic aioli is a nice touch. The only downside is the price. It's a bit on the expensive side for what you get.,1
"My friend wanted to take us to a Ukrainian restaurant for our first time. We got seats after waiting about 15 minutes on a busy Saturday afternoon. There are seats available for indoor dining as well as outside.We shared an order of the classic pierogi (mashed potato filling) and the stuffed cabbage which was forgotten and served to us after our entrees. Even though my friend requested for the pierogis to be steamed/boiled, they came fried. But I thought it added to the texture with the sides of apple sauce and sour cream. I really liked the cabbage since it had a slightly sweet but also very savory taste. For entrées we shared our dishes family style. We ordered the meat plate, meatballs, and beef stroganoff. I have happy with all the entrees we ordered and their side dishes which varied from salad, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut. Nothing was necessarily out of the park but definitely gave a home cooked vibe. The beef was soft and tasty with the egg noodles (not a traditional Ukrainian dish). Im not sure of the exact meats we tried from their combo plate but they had a pleasant saltiness and bite to them.Overall, good experience and would be interested in returning.",0
"Tl;dr: pricey for mediocre dim sum, oh and a surprise tea charge for black tea dregsWe should've known that it was mediocre by the fact that there was no line at 11:30am on a Saturday, but we decided to ignore our instincts.We ordered the tripe and the seafood/meat sample platter. The sample platter was unfortunately all over steamed and the peels were all falling off, and the tripe was extremely greasy. And the tea that they charged us for was some of the worst tea I've had. Save your money and go to literally any other dim sum place around here",0
"The food and atmosphere were ok, just that the waitress kept rushing us from the moment we sat down to make us order and then later to pay the bill. Sunday brunches are for hanging out with friends and catching up, not for a quick meal and out. I really didn't appreciate being rushed through brunch and then out of the place, especially since I haven't seen the friends I was meeting for a long while. Food wise - recommend the short rib Benedict, which was quite tender and flavorful. The salmon was quite bland and didn't have much flavor, the muffin was also burnt in a few places. The cover page photo was pretty misleading as the presentation of the dishes are simply awful - I did what I can with my picture but there was not much to go on. Maybe they are too busy to do plating? Drink wise - the mimosas were pretty tasty and sizable portions, good value if you're looking for bottomless brunch.",0
"This restaurant had a really cool look, with a reclaimed wood table and bar. However, the portion sizes were very small, and the lack of attention from our waitress made it a really unpleasant experience. The skirt steak was mediocre, and the arugula was barely dressed. The calamari was also very small, and we were not particularly impressed with the dessert menu either. Overall, this restaurant was not worth the price, and we would not recommend it.",1
"Came here in a group of 4 for dinner, and we had a great time! The cocktails are OK, nothing to write home about. This is a Chinese restaurant that caters to Americans, and it's in midtown/upper east, so of course it will be really overpriced.I really enjoyed the peking duck - it was the highlight of the night!The chopstick holders were adorable little pandas in various positions of repose. This was the cutest and most memorable part of the restaurant for me, not the food sadly.The restaurant did take precautions to be Covi safe - we were seated indoors with other patrons, and they did not space out, so they put up barriers between the tables.Overall, very nice for a dinner out on a Saturday, but very overpriced for Chinese food and not super authentic. Nonetheless quite enjoyed it!",0
"Nonono is a restaurant that I highly recommend. Their non-yakitori dishes are amazing, and I especially loved their tofu with nori topping. The tofu was light, flavorful, and my favorite dish here. The steamed egg was also great, with a great seafood flavor and a delicious broth. However, their yakitori dishes were also great. They were definitely better than the non-yakitori dishes!",1
"I really enjoyed my time at Chili Meili. The dishes we ordered were all very good, and the prices were definitely reasonable. I especially enjoyed the smoked duck dish, which was very smoky and flavorful. The dan dan noodles were also good, but I thought they could have been a bit more interesting. The tofu dish was also very tasty, and the crab meat added a nice touch of flavor. Overall, I thought the food was great and I would definitely come back to try out some of the other dishes on the menu.",1
"This place has a ton of seating. We got there right at opening on a Sunday, and we were seated quickly. It has a good atmosphere. The food wasn't the most amazing food I've had in my life, but it hit the spot. The portions are generous. I had the South of the Burger burger. It was pretty good. My friend got the Killer B's and really liked it. It's 5 large sliders with fries and onion rings.",0
"We came here on a Saturday night for a group dinner (6 people). It had been hyped up by our friends for a while, so we were really excited to try it. The ambiance is definitely fun and skews to a younger crowd. We waited outside with about 25-30 people for the 7 pm seating. The layout of the restaurant can result in tight spaces from start to finish. For example, the tables were small (even by NY standards). However, the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and offered great suggestions. We had a birthday cake and he even cut it for everyone! The pizzas are phenomenal!! We shared the Margherita pizza and it reminded me of pizza in Naples. My disappointment lies with the pasta. While I was hoping to try gnocchi pomodoro, they were not serving it that evening. I had penne pomodoro instead and shared a little bit of gnocchi with black garlic sauce. The pasta was cooked very well, but the pomodoro sauce was nothing special and while the black garlic sauce was unique, it didn't pair well with the gnocchi. For $20-25 pasta dishes, I expect better. Overall, decent spot if you're looking for a fun night out as a group and if you're in the mood for some Naples style pizza!",0
"I came here for their special Monday happy hour where they do dollar oysters and have a bunch of other discounted appetizers. The oysters were good but they may have been a ting bit old. I enjoyed the croquettes and the deviled eggs a lot. The truffle nuggets were a little odd and kind of dry so I wouldn't particularly recommend them, but they weren't awful. I will probably be back at some point to try a full meal here, but would recommend for their happy hour deals because the prices are right!",1
"Pretty much 3.5 stars. Came in for brunch and everything was good, just not great. I had a grapefruit mezcalita to start, which was an appropriate level of boozy. The toro taquitos were nice, not very flavorful. The crunch corn shell overpowered the tuna so I found myself breaking the shell in half to just eat it open face style. We shared the enchiladas Borrachos and the birria tacos. I enjoyed the enchiladas but my boyfriend preferred the tacos. The enchiladas was a sizable portion for $24, stuffed with pulled chicken and I enjoyed the tangy salsa with which they were smothered. The birria tacos were flavorful and the consume was delicious, but idk they left something to be desired for me. For $18 you only get two tacos which feels steep. I wasn't blown away but probably be back to try some other dishes. Still on the hunt for my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. Better options in the outer boroughs for now.",0
"Came to Ruby's for brunch with a couple of friends and really enjoyed my experience. The restaurant itself is super cute and all of the wait staff is very nice and attentive.The menu for brunch is great and definitely have something for everyone, I took a peek at the dinner menu as well and will definitely be returning to try it at some point soon. The egg sandwich was absolutely delicious, the BLT with egg was probably my favorite, I got my egg poached which made for a great photo opportunity as well :). The brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and seasoned and were very addictive, and the French fries were double friend which is my favorite.All around great experience and hope to be back again soon!!",0
"We came in for a late dinner. The staff were quite friendly. I got the EAK ramen and my husband got the Zebra ramenThe EAK ramen broth and noodles tasted great. The the thick noodles were cooked well and not too soggy. The ramen just came with some cooked spinach, a piece of toasted nori, and couple pieces of chashu pork. For $15, this was very plain to me. Extra toppings would cost $1-$2. You have to pay $1 for green onions. This is off putting for me.",0
"The cross bridge soup at this restaurant was greasy and not very flavorful. The tomato soup was also tough. The service was quick and attentive, but the seating was a bit tight.",1
"A little hole in the wall near Mount Sinai UES, and now the restaurant's name is covered with a scaffolding, making it even harder to find. I've frequented this takeout place for a few times now, and I'd say that their food is pretty decent. Their Fried Chicken Thighs was good. I wish the Jaeo sauce was a tad more tangy. Seasoned Garlic Beef was tasty, but beef on a bed of baby Bok Choi? -- nah. Rad Na was good as well. They also serve boba drinks!I recommend their lunch specials since the prices are more affordable.",0
"First time eating here in City..experience in downtownDenver Colorado pre-pandemic for work trip was a good time. This time Ordered online via Grub Hub for pickup for late Friday night arrival in NYC. Food was quick and by the time picked up at suggested ready time already lukewarm meaning it was done sooner then expected. Even for pickup require vaccine card and quickly greeted by this huge bouncer guy like when you used to go to club and they ask for your ID..brought me back to Pre21 days ID check lol. Korean tacos were very salty.. so if you order these get sauce on side and fried rice is super sticky rice n sriracha salty too and the beans and cheese in this plastic cup to side. Also sweet potato fries extra side missing maple syrup. Overall ok but not meeting my expectations for the franchise same taste and all. Front desk was quick for pickup though, good customer service and provided extra utensils.",0
"The decor in this place is beautiful! It's pretty small but we were seated right away on a Friday night. We had the strawberry martinis, and while they were strong, they were way too sweet with a syrup-y taste. Would not recommend. For food we had the basil fried rice which was delicious. I was surprised to see kow soi on the menu, which can be rare to find. However it was not very authentic, it was basically just chicken Penang curry over noodles. Still delicious though!",0
"I prefer the one at Grand street more as it has been consistently great. The one at this location is a miss or hit. One time I was here, the brussel sprouts came out soggy and not crisp & there was not much sauce in the bag w/ the seafood (that was overcooked). Staff was also very busy and not as friendly. If I ever crave for seafood, I will just go to the Grand street one.",0
"I absolutely loved Sweetcatch Poke! The fish was so fresh and the sauces were really delicious. I especially loved the Blazing Tuna, which had a great kick of spice. The rice was also really fluffy and perfect. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and healthy poke bowl!",1
"Had high hopes for this cafe so I'm sad to rate it so low. Came in during re-opening day of the museum. The atmosphere looked clean and cool and the staff assisted us right away however the food just wasn't very good. The Italian panini bread was tough and the meat was lifeless. The pasta was supposed to be made fresh but resembled canned Chef Boyardee. Very expensive to boot. Apparently looks can be deceiving here, and I felt like we wasted a meal in a city with so many other amazing eatery options. Wish we'd gone elsewhere.",0
Best fast food fried chicken I've had. The portions are generous which is awesome since many places barley give you enough food for the price. This friend chicken reminds of chick fil a chicken but better! Also they have so many sauce options which makes the experience even better. The fries are delicious! There are so many fries options and they are all soo good. This place is perfect for a quick bite to eat or a late dinner after going out in the city. Definitely will be coming back.,0
"The Ritz Diner is a great place to go for a quick meal. The service is standard and the food is ok. I wasn't a fan of the red cabbage slaw, but overall it was a good diner choice.",1
"Cha Kee is a restaurant that I had never heard of before, but after reading the great review in the New York Times, I decided to check it out. The food was delicious, and it was much higher quality than other restaurants nearby. I especially loved the branzino, which had so much flavor with shrimp paste and citrus flavors. The fried rice had large chunks of lobster and pieces of Uni, and was full of umami flavors. The curry chicken had olives, with more Portuguese flavorings than an Indian or Japanese curry. Much smokier and not as hot-spicy. I will definitely order again!",1
Delicious and creative dishes. One of my most favorite restaurants in nyc.It's a bit loud but the experience is always amazing.,0
"This place is amazing! It really feels like home and the portions are huge. Unfortunately, I visited on my last day in New York but I know where to go in the future. The food is great and the prices are reasonable. The unique mac and cheese pancake is a must-try and the steak and eggs are also fairly normal. The chicken and gravy is a bit too much though and the potatoes are a great side. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I love going to this restaurant! The carne asada is my favorite dish, and it always tastes great. The service is always great, and the atmosphere is very cozy and inviting. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Mexican meal!",1
"YO.... all you can eat lunch special for about $18 (including tax and tip!) ??? what a steal!other indian cuisines in this area actually go about the same price $13 and up for a curry... but this place lets you get all diff types of curry, naan, rice, etc for almost the same price.. UNLIMITED. great lunch buffet deal!The chicken tikka masala , the beef curry, saag, were all solid! and i esp loved the PURI(?) i think that's what it's called. it's like... small fried/baked fluffy naan.... first time trying it here. One down side is that i saw a cockroach near the bathroom, almost screamed and punched someone. But it ran away. Didn't see any the second time I went tho. Hmmmm as long as that was the only one i see, this place is still worth it lol. SAHIB, IF YOU READING THIS, PLEASE NO MORE BUGS. So yes, if u are hungry and craving indian, check this place out!",0
"Telio is a teli-no. To start, prices are ridiculous for the offer and even the area. A house salad + chicken is an upwards of $20. Really?  Even appetizers are all over $15, veggie sides all over $10. This made the whole experience kind of suck. I wanted to try something different but then didn't want to dislike it and be out $35. Opted for a safe route and got a chicken kebab with vegetables (mind you the side of vegetables with this are really just the ones on the kebab) and swapped the rice for a side of grilled veggies. They do provide 2 kebabs, which was generous- but I'd prefer just one and then a cheaper price so I could've gotten an appetizer or side. Food itself was very mediocre.  tzatziki tasted like cream cheese IMO. Also at around 7:30 they were already out of lamb and pork? But lets be real the worst part was the service. I swear we waited over 25 minutes to have our order taken, and half the place was empty. Got maybe one other interaction with our waitress (dropping food off) and that was it. Didn't even get offered dessert. Had to go out of our way to flag someone down for the bill, of course after a wait, and again wasn't even our waitress. Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't return.",0
"I had a great experience at An'Nam, thanks in part to great service and affordable sushi rolls. The outdoor seating was a nice touch, too. I'll be back for sure!",1
"I came here for lunch with a friend! We ordered take out which came out surprisingly swiftly. We took our food to the Washington square park and people watched. We ordered the takoyaki, the spicy karaage, and I ordered the spicy karaage bowl. All of the food is very filling and hearty. A lot of fried chicken and I don't think I would do that again. The takoyaki was soft and pliable -- it was my first time so I have no idea how it's supposed to taste, but it was good. The karaage was really ok, it was crunchy but I wasn't sure about the quality of the meat. The rice was delicious and everything well seasoned. The proportion of sauce to chicken to rice was way off in favor of the sauce, and the chicken was hard to eat because it was so big. Overall, I don't think I will be back, especially when there is so much great food in this area.",0
"I had a wonderful time at Elis Wine Bar last night! The restaurant is beautifully designed and the vibe is very energetic and happy - everyone was eating, laughing, and drinking good wine. The service was extremely hospitable and kind, Artur and Elis (the owners) truly went above and beyond to make my first time at their restaurant very special. I am a seafood lover and Artur made the best food recommendations based on my palate. We started with the oysters and Artur delicately and skillfully prepared and seasoned it for me at table side! I also tried the ceviche and it melted like butter in my mouth lol, it was so delicious! For the entree Artur recommended the Branzino and it was prepared and seasoned to perfection! For wine we had a bottle (or 2, lol) of red, the L'Atto Cantine del Notaio which was excellent! I'm a red wine lover and i never follow the rules when it comes to food pairings lol. Elis was kind enough to make sure that my wine glass was refilled when the wine was running low lol. I will certainly return soon, I am already craving the oysters, the food and the attention! Thank you, Art",1
"As I entered Penn Station for the first time to take the Amtrak, I was greeted by seemingly endless walkways towards trains, local and beyond. The station offered many different food choices scattered along the side on both floors including Penn Sushi. Since it was my first time there, I did not want to wander off too far. Penn Sushi was right near the Amtrak boarding areas and was close to other food options such as KFC and Starbucks. For their food, I'm not too sure if there is a menu to order from. It was a relatively small operation with three ladies there preparing and assisting customers. The main display in front of their counter offers prepackaged sushi that they make in store. They have rolls as well as nigiris along with plenty of drink and snack options. The front also have a small area for patrons to eat while waiting for their train. I purchased their mixed roll which had three pieces each of spicy salmon, salmon, and California. The spicy salmon seemed more red than most that I've seen at other sushi joints but taste was fine. Overall I think it's a great and quick spot for those that are waiting in the Amtrak area. No wait time, just grand and go.",0
"Jacob's is a popular brunch spot in the UWS and they don't take reservations. I made reservations at another place just in case but wanted to swing by and try my luck. So on a Saturday around noon, my cousin and I walked over to Jacob's. From across the street, it looked packed! There were people lined up outside and others sitting on the curb but I wasn't about to give up. We stood on a line to put our names down and the Food Gods were definitely blessing me, bc the hostess quoted us a 25 minute wait, and there were open seats at the bar as well. I wanted a table (big mistake) instead of eating at the bar but we still grabbed 2 jam jars at the bar. Halfway thru our cocktails, the table was ready, and we were led to a giant communal table. So if you happen to score seats at the bar, definitely stick with that, bc it's much more spacious and comfortable than the communal tables.

It was very LOUD, I actually lost my voice the next day bc I kept having to yell across the table at my cousin (and I'm pretty loud to begin with). We started with the fried pickles, which were amazing! I definitely had",1
"We're kidding, right people?Came here for a work lunch.  Was harassed almost immediately because the whole party wasn't there on time.  I get that being annoying, and maybe limiting our time at the restaurant, however once we sat down the time limit miraculously disappeared.  The staff in general (even the pushy guy) were nice at least.Because we were rushed, we just got burrata and the Cacio and Pepe fritters.  Burrata was just fine although the watermelon it came with had great flavor.  Fritters we're their take on proscuitto balls except with the proscuitto (basically a fried ball of ricotta); they were very good and perfect to share.  Unfortunately things nosedived for my main course.  I got the linguini and clams.  This was the most disappointing pasta and clams dish that I've ever had.  The portion of clams itself was tiny.  I love Manila clams, but these were pretty bland.  The lemon breadcrumbs had no zest and there was no chili pepper to speak of.  The pasta itself was fine, but it was wasted as there was no flavor for it to soak up.  $25 for this was laughable.  Should've gotten the chicken milanese and which looked much better.The tiramisu with the sheep on top was cute and perfectly fine.  Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of tiramisu, and I would've liked a more bold espresso flavor, however this was acceptable.  Espresso itself was good.If you're stuck getting lunch in Midtown and want Italian, you can do better than this.  Please at least try.  Unless you only want appetizers and desserts.",0
"The Bao is a popular restaurant with a cramped seating area. I wasn't sure why mediocrity excites lines, but the Scallion Pancake (C) was nicely textured and fluffed in layers. However, this dish was only served with soy which didn't match at all since the pancake was already savory. Some acidic and/or spicy dipping sauce would better elevate this dish. The Shanghai Noodles (C) were well cooked, but I feel like the dish is kind of mundane and needs to be elevated with some vibrancy. There is a few slivers of pork and bok choy mixed amongst the noodles, but it is pretty bare overall. It is well seasoned though, but rather expensive for strictly noodles.",1
"Been here several times where their soft serve machine isn't working. The times it was working and I asked for a to-go order of ice cream, they don't have lids for the containers and just wrap some aluminum foil on top of the cardboard bowl. SMH doesn't seem like the most effective way to pack ice cream, but I guess since the machine rarely works, it is not a big deal.",0
"Vanessa's Dumplings is very much a part of the food landscape in NYC known for its dumplings, sesame pancakes, noodles, and low prices. the hole-in-the-wall eatery got renovated and looks a bit more clean and modern. this is a no-frills eatery: order at the register for dine-in or takeout and pay, stakeout one of the few tables inside if you're staying, and wait for your food ticket  number to be called. there are always seems to be a general sense of confusion at Vanessa's amongst the staff as to what order is up or amongst new customers who don't know how things work at the Chinatown eatery. and that is why i only do takeout here and Kew my orders super simple. i wish Vanessa's would add a little bit of order to the general chaos bc at times it can be a tad hectic. last time i was here, i got the sesame pancake sandwich filled with Peking duck ($6.50). the pancake is more of a fried puffy bread and it was glorious. it's soft, slightly crispy, oily, and full of flavor. this time around i found the the duck filling way way too salty (i  have had it before and it's been fine) and there's was not much duck filling in the sandwich, itself. next time, I'll plain pancake sandwich or just get a veggie filling. between the carb calories and it being fried--it's filling all by itself. definitely a worthwhile food stop if you're patient bc when the food hits...it hits nicely. but when it misses...big whiff. the staff seem stressed but work fast. the ordering and pickup system needs work bc it is way too confusing and chaotic when the restaurant is packed. however you can call in your orders for pickup now, so there has been progress. drops mic cuz Chinatown is an experience i outzzz",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The broth was delicious - so hearty and flavorful, without (for once) being too salty. The portion sizes were good. Noodles cooked perfectly, pork cooked perfectly with a nice strip of fat on each piece. The service was really friendly and respectful. They have a couple of bar-seating areas, so it's a great place to grab food alone.",1
"Tried this out tonight. It was ok. I was 10 minutes early but to my surprise it was ready and when they handed me the box it wasn't warm at all. I had a 10 minute walk back to the hotel and when I arrived, sure enough, it was really cold. The crust was too soft, the crust a little too chewy. Not really for me but the toppings were plentiful and nice size.",0
"I definitely wanted to come try this new dim sum place after hearing their new twist to dim sum as they have vegan/vegetarian options! They have most of the OG dim sum items like har gow, xiu mai, and sticky rice but they're missing egg tarts and pan fried turnip cakes! All the dishes tasted mediocre, not terrible but not amazing. For the price and vegetarian friendly options, it's decent but if you want an authentic dim sum experience, I would go elsewhere.",0
"I only had drinks here - I was planning to have food but the drinks experience was bad enough to leave. I came with a party of 6 and the place was completely empty. I was excited to see they had wine flights. We planned to order 1 flight to taste and then order full glasses or bottles, but the waiter said we couldn't do that and that we had to order 1 flight per person. I explained our intentions, but he said it was restaurant rules and that we couldn't share them. What kind of restaurant decides what I can or cannot order? Or what I can or cannot do with what I order? I felt insulted, like they are trying to make sure I spend money here. It is unclear to me if it was the waiter or the restaurant, but either way, this rule did the opposite, preventing the bill to be much bigger. We were planning on drinking and eating dinner here, and instead only had one glass of wine and left. As if that wasn't enough the service wasn't good either. The waiter stayed behind the counter the entire time, almost in a lazy way, instead of coming to the table to ask us what we wanted... and the place was completely empty. Needless to say, I won't be coming back. Z.",0
"Overall would go back but get rice with my entree (or ask for half rice half salad) rather than just saladOrdered the Jeyuk entree - spicy pork and veggiesEntrees come with pickles as well as your choice of rice or salad. The portion sizes are fair for the price - not too small nor too big. It is pretty high quality, healthy food so I'd almost say this is on the cheap side. Think of it as fast casual food since it seems like most the food is pre made (understandable since their good probs takes forever to marinate to get so flavorful!) so all they need to do is quickly pack the food once you order. Meat is great. Pickled veggies is great! Just sad that the salad is just kale, literally nothing special nor anything done to it  Service is great - super friendly Super small place with only 3 stool seats but also super cute, modern and elegant with how they've designed their small space",0
"After the long awaited hype and the difficulty in securing a reservation, my friends and I managed to snag a spot to try the famous Carbone. I've heard from people that it's great or overhyped. But to try it and to form my own opinion. My opinion is to agree that the food is overhyped and there's nothing that blows this place out of the park to live up to the word of mouth that passes around of this place. The pasta were all very normal, replicable at home, and overpriced. I've been to many places in LA that the pasta is much tastier and more special (and not to mention a larger portion). A vodka rigatoni could hardly justify $25 to me when I can make my own vodka rigatoni that's just as good (if not better) at home for at least half the cost. Also, who is purchasing a branzino for $95. Please tell me. Overall, OK food at best and would not come here again. If a friend is curious, would tell them to try it out for the hype but would not be a recommendation.",0
"Llama San is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The interior is beautiful and the staff is attentive and knowledgeable. Our table favorite was the pizou pizou pizou, which is a delicious Pisco Sour. The pre fixe menu is a great way to sample a variety of dishes, and we were very happy with our selections. The ceviches were also very good, with our favorite being the scallops. The tofu and shrimp dish was also very good, and we especially loved the yellow sauce. The only downside was the chicken thigh, which was a bit bland for our taste. Overall, we had a great time at Llama San and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Hanoi House was a great substitute for An Choi, a place I used to go for pho all the time. The broth was flavorful and deep, and the staff was accommodating, wearing masks and gloves. The only downside was that the restaurant was very busy, so it was hard to get a seat. The QR code menu made it easy to order.",1
"The Galaxy Restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in New York City. I've been coming here for over 23 years and the service and food have always been great. Unfortunately, their latest remodel has removed a lot of the history and character of the restaurant, but the size of the place has more than doubled so it's still a great place to eat.",1
"GaGa is a great vegetarian-friendly spot for a quick and tasty lunch. I really enjoyed the vegetable dry pot. It's a melange of delicious tofu cubes, broccoli, cabbage, and seaweed and comes with a choice of white or brown rice. GaGa would be a great spot for lunch next time you have jury duty or find yourself in the financial district for some other reason!",1
"I'm from LA and apparently we don't have good pizza out here. Now, I had no clue that was true until I started dating a New Yorker. I went to nyc for the first time and ofc pizza was on the to do list to see if it lived up to the hype. Joes is his favorite spot to ""grab a slice"".

This is foreign territory to me because LA you gotta buy the whole thing. Anyways we got our slice really fast and ate inside. It's a little grungy inside but it's part of the vibe I suppose. Delicious. Omg. I went back and order two more slices. Completely ruined my dinner by turning a snack into a four slice pizza meal. TLDR Needless to say LA's pizza is trash and this place is bomb.",1
"We tried Soho Park, located in Hell's Kitchen with a party of six at 12noon on a Friday in late June.What can I say?  It was a totally average experience.  The place is pretty nice with three floors of dining opportunity and a back patio.  We were on the second floor.  It was pretty empty for lunchtime, which was a little odd in this neighborhood.I think I found the problem -- staffing.  Wow....there apparently was only one server for the entire restaurant (he was also the bartender).  There was a food runner and a busser; however, one server.  It took forever for a simple request.  He was pleasant and pretty nice; however, I really can't get past that.I had the Cobb Salad and it was pretty good.  Good food, good space, great for groups, limited service.",0
"The hype is not worth the bite in my opinion. The portions are incredibly small, which is to be expected to some degree, but the food was not good enough go justify the price.We started with burrata and asparagus- the burrata was likely the best burrata I've ever had, the asparagus was nothing amazing. We split 3 entrees, the short rib bone marrow pasta, the caico e Pepe ravioli, and the spaghetti with red sauce. I was the only one at the table who liked the short rib pasta (it was also room temperature), the spaghetti with red sauce was absolutely regular and nothing special. The caico e Pepe ravioli was good. For dessert we had the chocolate cake which was about 3 inches in diameter, the panecotta which was OK, and the espresso budino which was the best out of the 3.The best menu item was the bread basket we had at the beginning. It had focaccia, a roll, and some type of meat roll, which were all to die for. The service was good, we were outdoors, which probably impacted the ambiance. The food came out fairly quickly. I would just rather have my dollars go father elsewhere",0
First let me say that even though this restaurant is close this is the first time I've ever ordered for delivery from here. I ordered the spare rib combination for delivery. When the delivery guy came he kept some of the change for his tip. I told him to give me my change and if I want to give him a tip I would. So he ended up getting a smaller tip than what I would normally have given. When I took the food out of the bag the first thing I noticed was that all the rooms were burnt. I called the restaurant with my complaint and they tried to tell me that that was barbecue sauce. He really tried hard to explain that it was sauce. Umm I guess then the sauce was burnt. The fried rice wasn't good either but the egg roll was pretty good.I only ordered from here because the one I normally would order from was closed today and I was feeling lazy and didn't want to cook. Lesson learned!I will not order from here again.,0
"I was really excited to try XO Taste, but unfortunately my experience was not great. The menu is a hot mess-- it seems like XO Taste wants to cast a net as wide as possible and because of that, it becomes too overwhelming for patrons to choose. Is XO Taste a dim sum parlor? a HK cafe? What's up with the sizzling platters? Not trying to hate on restaurants trying to offer a range of foods but the range here feels almost schizophrenic. I sincerely feel the quality of the food would benefit if the menu is slightly reduced or rearranged to follow some kind of theme.",1
"I had a great time at Minetta, and the food was amazing. The octopus was my favorite dish, and the risotto was also delicious. The only downside was that the noise level was really loud, and it was hard to have a conversation with my date. However, the experience was definitely worth it.",1
"I had a great experience at Antoya, formerly known as Samwon Garden. The portions did get a bit smaller and prices did increase, but the food was still really great! Our waitress, Chloe, was very attentive and fantastic. Service was excellent. The egg soufflé was delicious (we normally do not order this!). The meat quality was still amazing! So tender. The meat is not overly fatty (like some kbbq places that just give chunks of fat). I would come back!",1
"The dumplings here have definitely gone downhill in recent times. They're very oily and not at all crunchy, and the meat inside isn't as flavourful as it used to be. Unfortunately, the lady who works here has always been very nice to me, so it's hard to give this place a negative review.",1
"I had higher expectations of this place based on word of mouth; I would rate it 3.5 stars. Known for their sandwiches (although they also have salads and soups), I ordered the ""Uncle Vinny"". This sandwich was prosciutto, brie, apple, arugula, and fig tahini on ciabatta bread. I appreciate the large amount of prosciutto they put on the sandwich, however, it was so cold that it was literally half frozen. A big bite full of icy meat. They skimped on the brie cheese (one veryyyy tiny piece for the entire sandwich) and I felt that there was too much arugula. Other than the proportions being off, I felt the flavors all blended together really well. I really wanted to LOVE this sandwich, especially for $16, and I just didn't. I would give this place another try though because all the ingredients (including the bread) were super fresh; the service was also super fast.",0
A grown ups bar which is nice in sometimes fratty east village. Inventive tasty cocktails. Great service at the bar,0
"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the positive reviews I've read, but unfortunately my experience didn't meet my expectations. The HH menu stated that happy hour ended at 7pm, but we arrived at 6:40pm and were told that seating was closed for HH. We were then given a piecemeal order of drinks and appetizers, which didn't make up for the shortened HH. The food was Ok, but the fries were the best part of the meal. The service was poor, and I don't think I'll be returning.",1
"Went here for all you can eat sushi where I could add a broad variety of dishes off of their menu to an iPad taking in our order allowing me to try new dishes and revisit old ones without the stress of going too far with the spending! For $39 pre-tax I could select an endless quantity of meals off their menu, limited to one weekly specials and one dessert per person, which nevertheless was still a lot of food.I really appreciate their no waste policy for which you're charged an additional amount depending on how much food you waste, which helps with a sanity check which is particularly important when you're trying to be environmentally conscious and respectful to food served.Some of my favorites of the menu were the Torched Eel Sashimi and Nigiri each served per individual piece, some sort of roasted Salmon fillet, Citrus Salmon wrapped around fresh straws of fruit and veggies which came off the weekly specials list, Baked Mussels and loved that I could order heaps of pickled ginger alongside since I'm never content with just a single serving often given with Sushi.Their desserts, which each person is allowed to order only one of, were average as you can tell they weren't made in-house. Since I went with a bunch of friends, I was able to try a bit of almost all. The Mochi was packaged and the same one you get from any grocery store, the Chocolate Mousse came in a small sized shot glass so it was barely a spoonful, the Ice Cream was pretty okay and a little icy, and the serving of Lychee was straight out of a can. However, I loved the Chocolate Cake even if it wasn't prepared in-house. Desserts are definitely not their strong point but a robust menu of everything else makes up for it! Within two hours, the time limit for the AYCE, I was able to explore their entire menu which was a great experience that came at an affordable price point!",0
"I stopped by Yiwanmen today for a quick bowl of beef noodle soup and wasn't impressed. The soup was bland and didn't have a lot of meat in it. I also didn't appreciate that it didn't come with any extras, like a side of rice or anything. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food came in a timely matter and everyone in my group had something they liked. The only downside was that the restaurant was pretty crowded and it was 1 in the morning. The nachos were my favorite dish and the Cuban burger was also excellent. The cheesecake cocktail was also a nice touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
A friend recommended Joe Allen and Orso to us. We were also told it's the same owner for both restaurants. We dined at Orso the evening before and loved the food and had a lovely experience. We had high expectations for this restaurant. The host was nice and friendly so everything started great. We ordered A Caesar salad which was good. Chicken with Brussels sprout - the Brussels sprouts were really good. Chicken was just ok. The Branzino wasn't that great which was so disappointing because Orso's branzino was delicious. None of us finished our food. We ordered 1 hamburger plain and 1 cheeseburger (cheddar cheese on the side) both medium well for the kids. The hamburger and fries was fine. The 1st cheeseburger came out with Swiss cheese on it. The 2nd burger came out and it was very rare (see photo). The restaurant was very busy as people came to dine before a broadway show so we weren't able to get the burger fixed. The kids finished their fries as least. The waitress was great and was apologetic. Maybe we just came at the wrong time. I'd definitely go back to Orso!! It was amazing there.,0
"I had a great time at Adoro Lei! The bartender was super nice and let me try some of their new summer beers. I ended up getting the truffle rice balls for $5. They were so good! Super cheesy and gooey in the middle but fried nicely. I would definitely go back just for those alone.

I also used HOOCH here to get a free cocktail. It was delicious and looked so pretty. With the nice weather they have some outdoor seating that I would love to come back and use.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the rice was good too. I ordered lunch gen tso chicken and it was crispy on the outside, yet juicy on the inside. I was SO happy with the chicken for every bite. The egg drop soup was alright but not as good as others I've had. Appreciate how they give packet of chowmein noodles with the soup. Really made it better.",1
I had a great experience at Prince Street Pizza. The line wasn't too bad and the pizza was even better than I expected. The pepperoni was delicious and the crust was really good. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good pizza place in New York.,1
"This review is for the back room: of course there's a wait on a Saturday night, if enough foresight make a reservation in advance (they quoted one hr but texted in 30min to come back). The cocktail menu reads like a food menu with the lighter drinks as 'appetizers' (cold Japanese noodle), 'main meal' drinks like cold pizza and mango sticky rice, then sweeter drinks as 'dessert' like key lime pie. The cold Japanese noodle and key lime pie blew our minds. Noodle drink was light and tropical, but still savory from the sesame oil. The key lime pie was EVERYTHING: creamy, fizzy, tart, sweet. The lingering taste of winter melon was an unexpected asian twist. I took a friend from out of town that doesn't like alcohol and he said it changed his mind completely! Nyc really does cocktails best and this is the pinnacle.",0
"I've ordered food from here twice online, and both times, while they included everything in my order, I asked for them to include a side of the chipotle aioli in my bag and they didn't do it. They also did not include any utensils either time. I ordered the mac and cheese for a third time on Monday, and it just tasted completely off. Something about the sauce this time was almost chemical-y, and it just didn't taste right in comparison to the two times I had it before. It also left a really odd mouth feel. I've had their mac and cheese, their juices, the chia seed pudding, a push pop, and a rainbow cookie from there - along with other things. The juices are good, as was the chia seed pudding. The push pop was almost completely melted by the time it got to me and it was just too sweet for me. My biggest complaint with by Chloe is that they couldn't follow the simple directions on my order and they didn't include utensils. I had to then go hunting for them in my office. There was also then no way to call them to tell theme these issues, so I was just stuck. When my husband did finally email them, which is how they want you to contact them when you have an issue with an order, he still hasn't heard back over 48 hours later. I definitely don't think I'll be ordering online from them again because this isn't how you should be treating your customers.",0
"Topaz Noodle Bar is a great option for late night dinner on a Monday. The restaurant is crowded, but the wait is worth it for the delicious food. The service was a bit slow, but the staff was attentive and polite. Our kids were a bit of a distraction, but overall the restaurant had a great vibe. The food was delicious, with a higher quality and flavor than most standard Thai restaurants. We'd definitely recommend Topaz Noodle Bar to others.",1
"Man, I really wanted to like this place so much but the service ruined the experience:( Our server greeted us unpleasantly at the front then it took close to 10 minutes for him to come back to our table once seated. We saw multiple tables asking to place their order when we decided to do the same, (reading the room). That was the best decision since it took a while just for our drinks to come out and when I saw drinks I just mean water.In regards to our food and drinks everything was great outside of the tuna tacos; very bland and flavorless. The tuna flight was really good.I would saw the decor of the restaurant is cute but please hire more attentive staff that can handle a rush; I won't be coming back here unfortunately.",0
"One of my favourite by Chloe locations to stop by for lunch. Their salads are really good, reasonably priced ($10.50) and delicious! My favourite is their Kale Caesar Salad with mushroom ""bacon"". My only complaint is that their mushroom ""bacon"" is extremely salty and their sweet potato fries (even though they say are air baked, could be less oily. However, these sweet potato fries are delicious- even though they taste deep fried. Another great dish is their Spicy Thai Salad. Would definitely come back.",0
"There were some combos that seemed impressive but that might not be ideal for a long haul on the PATH, so I went for the spicy pork and spicy tuna kimbaps. While the tuna was a more assertive main ingredient, the pork version was more of an ensemble piece. Why isn't burdock root more famous?",0
"The decor here surely makes you think of SE asia, malaysia, singapore. But the food doesn't quite meet up with it's forebearers. It's strange they have pad thai here even though its a malaysian place. The pad thai was quite too sweet for me. The hainese chicken was sparse and mostly bones rather than meat and you had to order the rice separately where they usually come together. The rice itself didn't even that usual chicken flavor. A bit pricey for the area as well. I wouldn't really recommend as i've had better.",0
"This review is based on a delivery experience.I ordered through their website without any issues. My order did arrive about 30mins late. I got the pan fried chicken family meal which comes with 10 pieces of chicken, 3 16oz sides and cornbread ($40). I had to also get their desserts to try.Chicken: Assuming due to the late delivery and the steam in the bag, my chicken wasn't crispy crunchy. It wasn't very juicy or moist or overly seasoned. I did appreciate that the chicken didn't taste greasy. Cornbread:The cornbread is soooo good! It's soft, fluffy and moist. I couldn't get enough of it. It was breaking apart as I was trying to pick it up from the container. Baked Mac and cheese:Skip this as a side. I was not impressed. The Mac and cheese lacked flavor and just felt ""wet"". Collard Greens:Pretty solid collard greens. Would order it againPotato Salad: The potato salad was good if you enjoy the taste of yellow mustard. Some of the potato's still had a little bite to it but not necessarily raw. Banana Pudding:A very good and solid banana pudding. Would def get again when I'm in the mood.  It's definitely cheaper making it on your own though. Red velvet cake:5/5This cake is soooo freaking good. The cake is super moist and fluffy and just the right amount of chocolate in a red velvet that you're supposed to experience. Ughhh I'm salivating wishing I could have another bite. Sweet potato pie:Good solid sweet potato pie. Can't go wrong this ordering one.All in all, this is a pretty great place for soul food. There are a couple hits and misses. Really wished the Mac and cheese was better.",0
"Honestly, some of the slowest service I have ever received. Management had to remake our white sangria twice because it was basically just watered down white wine without any fruit and they even admitted that it was bad so we switched it to a red sangria. They said because of the trouble they would provide a free refill of our pitcher, which never came. Food orders were taken about 45 minutes after we were seated and then another 45 minutes until we saw any dishes arrive at our table. Thankfully the dishes were pretty good (pulpo, hangar steak, and farro salad with steak). The steak in the salad was a bit tough and difficult to slice, given they just gave me a butter knife. I don't think I'll be returning because the service was that bad, even though the food was pretty good.",0
"MJ Smith's Food and Spirits is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The atmosphere is sophisticated and dark, with low lighting and wood finishes. There's plenty of seating in the front at cocktail tables, at the bar, and in the dining room at the back. We ordered drinks only, but we can see this being a great place to come for lunch, dinner, or late night bites if you're willing to spend a decent amount of money.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The hostess was super friendly and promptly seated me even though I was early. My waiter was super attentive and made great suggestions. Finally, the manager was the best and even got my dog water (had to bring her and we had outdoor seating). The food was very solid and got the New York sushi (which is basically a mini omakase plus a roll). Sushi was good, but pieces were a bit overwhelming with wasabi. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be returning!",1
I was really disappointed by this place because I had been hoping for some good sushi and instead had a bleh meal with a $170 bill. I hope they can turn themselves around soon.,1
"The pork belly buns are skippable. They were good, but not really so spectacular in my opinion- especially for the price. The smoke pork ramen- I thought the ingredients inside the ramen were fantastic. It just wasn't the ramen that I was looking for. I think that rich broth that we all look for. It just didn't hit the spot. Maybe they were going for something different, but it just wasn't a home run. Maybe if it was a different dish, it would be awesome, but when I think about the perfect ramen, this wasn't it.",1
"Los Tacos No 1 is a hidden gem in bustling Chelsea Market. The carne asada was great! Juicy and tender meat and delicious green sauce. A ""hidden"" gem, Los Tacos No 1 is definitely worth a visit.",1
"Overall: Did take out, Very tasty food, overpricedThe food was probably the best and most authentic dry pot Chinese food I've had in the city. The flavors were great and the customization was great too. I like the fish, tripe, bok choy, enoki mushroom. Even though it was super tasty, it was very very expensive. I don't know if I could justify the price for the food that you get. I think everyone should at least try once and make a decision for themselves.",0
Cafeteria is a great place to go for a casual meal. The outdoor seating is perfect for a summer day. The service was attentive and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the yellowfin tuna crudo.,1
I wish the line here was ever short. The hand rolls here are definitely the best in the city (definitely omakase handroll quality). The price is reasonable and the service is always quick.They give you a menu with a pencil so you can check off the option of hand rolls you want. Everything is delicious! You can always add on more handrolls if you'd like. There's not many options for apps.All the seats are on the sushi bar at this place. No table service.,0
"I had the pleasure of dining at Tribeca Grill last night and was really disappointed. The interior is really beautiful and classic, but the food didn't live up to the standards. I ordered the flatbread pizza and the endive salad, and both were really bland. The salmon was also disappointing - it was overcooked and had a really strong taste of truffle, which was really strange. The servers were trying to rush us through our courses, which was really off-putting. Overall, I wasn't impressed and would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I have been waiting forever to be able to get a reservation here and it finally happened this last Saturday. I am so blown away and everything about L'Artusi is worth the hype. The ambience is so pretty and the private wine room is beautiful and can seat up to 14. To my favorite part, the food- everything we had was incredible. There was no dish that I tried that I didn't absolutely love. My friends and I shared the wagyu carpaccio, tuna tartar, burrata and brussel sprouts. The burrata toast was absolutely delicious and my favorite. The wagyu carpaccio was fantastic and so fresh and we loved the tuna tartar. For my entree I had the Pici with crab and it was my favorite part of the meal. It was perfectly cooked to Al Dente and normally I'm not a big crab eater but you cannot miss it when coming here. For dessert the olive oil cake is an absolute must!",0
I really enjoyed my time at Gupshup. The food was delicious and the service was great. I especially loved the gunpowder brazinino. It was cooked perfectly and the mango sauce was delightful. I would definitely visit this restaurant again.,1
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the food at this restaurant. It didn't taste as seasoned as the food I've had in Xi'an before, and the prices were also a bit on the high side. However, the dishes were still affordable, and it was nice that most of them were served on small plates so you could bus your own.",1
"Okay, so you would think that with the pandemic, the staff would be on edge, making sure everything is on point to make a come back from when they were closed. Drinks-- I ordered a frozen passionfruit margarita... the color was yellow and had a different taste. When I asked, I was told that the inside of the restaurant was hot, so it is like that... (?) Wait... what? The good thing was that they changed it for a mango margarita. Oh, and my friend ordered a drink... and got something completely different than what she asked for.Food-- I was told that the platter was enough to feed three people; not true. I could eat an entire platter on my own. The platter included two tiny steak tacos, two chicken quesadilla slices (so like half of a full quesadilla), chips, the smallest little plastic of guac, and french fries. The food was bland... oh and even though my friends and I ordered the food at the same time, our food came out at different times. One of my friends got her food at least 15 minutes after me.",0
"Eh....Even by the ""Asian food for Western palates"" standard I applied to this place (menus all in English, mostly non-Asian clientele, etc.), this place was just meh. Madame Pho? Bland broth. Bun Bo Hue? Little umami. Garlic Noodles? Greasy. As authentic Vietnamese, it definitely doesn't work. As fusion Vietnamese, it also doesn't work. It's just somewhere in the mediocre middle.",0
"I recently visited Harlem's newest restaurant, and unfortunately, I didn't have a great experience. The dish components didn't seem to match and were clashing like a bad band, making it difficult to enjoy the individual flavors. Additionally, the sticky rice was a sore thumb, as it felt like you needed the sauce to mask all of the conflicting flavors. The staff seemed a bit confused by it all, which made the experience even worse. I wouldn't recommend this place, and I won't be returning, ever.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was great and the service was great. The only downside was that the place was pretty crowded so it was difficult to find a seat. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"The food at Mighty Bowl is great, and the price is unbeatable! The chicken tastes really authentic, and I love how quickly it comes out. However, I was disappointed that I ordered takeout and got missing two of the items. I would still come back to Mighty Bowl, though!",1
"This place has the best lunch deals. Around 10 dollars for an appetizer and a main. Absolutely mindblowing deals in my opinion. The service was great and I liked the ambience too. I ordered the Thai dumplings, and they sure are a unique treat. The skin is layered, with chicken and peanuts inside. It was both soft and crunchy, and a genuine flavor explosion in my mouth. I also had their pad thai, and you can never go wrong with pad thai. The peanut and lemon blended well together with a slight sourness. Honestly great portion size-too big for me to finish-for the price you are paying. The green salad also had a lovely spice and crunch to it, and the fried rice had an aromatic soy smell. Overall, great lunch and would definitely return to try other dishes!",0
"Back again and it is the same but better.  Very comfortable setting with socially distanced tables and attentive masked staffIt's been over a year and the visit was again excellent. Hot to see my friends again and Sean and his team took care of us!We started with seafood.  Exceptional shrimp, firm plumb and accompanied by the requested horseradish and cocktail sauce.  The crab cocktail equally form and a generous helping. Salad was an interlude followed bu exceptional, thick juicy fillets!  Cooked to each persons specs.  June more rare and it was delightful.  The salt and grill on the exterior drew out the flavor of this ultra tender steak.  What a great night.  Great to be back. I highly recommend this place!!!",0
"Bar Boulud's waiters were fantastic. Food was good, but a bit expensive. I came for restaurant week. I have been to the D-BAR, and I liked the outdoor seating of Bar Boulud. It's nice in the summer. I would say the waiters outside are much better and more efficient than the person checking in people who had reservations. She was friendly, but a bit slow. My appetizer was a salad. The dressing was quite heavy (a nice amount unless you prefer dressing on the side). I was served both baguette and sourdough bread. The sourdough was my favourite. As a main course, I got the mussels, which were ok -- filling for sure. They came with toasted bread, which was very good. I would say the white wine was a bit too heavy. Some of the mussels were undercooked, so they did not open completely (stayed shut), or were difficult to put out of their shell. Thankfully they were fresh, but on a hot summer day, this could potentially be a problem if they are undercooked and go bad... The dessert was a caramel custard (which is not on the regular menu). It was like a panna cotta (a little less dense) with a soft almond based cookie on top. In my opinion the cookie was a little too soft. I would have like it more cooked, or crunchy. The vanilla chantilly was delicious, just enough sweetness, and the caramelized apples remind me of a tarte tatin.Would go back, and probably check out the epicerie next door too (they sell canelés!)",0
"I cannot rave enough about L'Artusi! The atmosphere is so pretty and the private wine room is beautiful and can seat up to 14.

"Probably my favorite Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood. The staples, yakitori, do not disappoint. But the other izakaya and tapas items are also delicious. There's a few fun drinks on the menu, and the service is great. Will definitely be a regular.",0
"I absolutely enjoyed my experience at Raku! The food arrived quickly and was very affordable. I especially loved the bento box - it was full of delicious sushi rolls and an appetizer, as well as rice and two orange slices. My favorite dish was definitely the pork katsu, which was a little tough but still delicious. The sauces on the Gyoza and the katsu were just perfect, and I really enjoyed the crunchy shrimp tempura. I would definitely recommend Raku to anyone looking for a great sushi experience at a reasonable price.",1
"I have been wanting to check out Onieals for so long. The location is prime, even on a quiet rainy Friday night. I was able to grab a table for 3 without a reservation. The drinks were tasty. One person got a cab, another got ""Not Your Average Negroni"" and I got a ""Kentucky Tea"" to start. The drinks were strong and perfectly sized. We shared everything, so we ordered the calamari fritti, fish tacos, penne vodka, rigatoni bolognese, grilles corn and kale zoodle, Parmesan fries, and Brussel sprouts. Everything was fantastic, but we were definitely disappointed by the brussel sprouts. We recognize that it is a side dish, but it was practically served in a small dipping cup. We were surprised by the penne vodka because they spiced it up. It was a good amount of spice where you can still enjoy the food. I would definitely go back for food and drinks. The music was also very cool, think late 90s, early 2000's hip hop and r&b but the music rotated to more current songs too.",0
"I had a poke bowl with three scoops of protein and I enjoyed it. The scoops were a good size and there were a lot of toppings to choose from, including premium ones like crab salad and seaweed salad. The sauces were good, but I was disappointed that the fish was so tiny.",1
"Stopped by to meet my son and his fiance because this place has sentimental meaning to them. Service was good, but the food was meh. Decor could use some updating as well. It is very dark inside. My pastrami was so incredibly dry and flavorless. Disappointing, but it didn't dampen the visittoo much.",0
"The Rag Trader is a great place to go for dinner. The staff is always friendly and attentive, and the food and drinks are all delicious. I've tried almost all of the menu items, and I've never been disappointed. I especially love the mac and cheese, which is a must-try. It's also walking distance to both Penn Station and Port Authority, which makes it convenient for those who work in the city and live in the surrounding areas.",1
"I needed to find a restaurant that took reservations for 5 people at the last minute on a Friday night, had a lot of vegan options, and didn't make everything spicy. Surprisingly, this cut down options a lot. Meet Noodles, since it is pretty new, managed to fit us in (though ultimately they sat us about 20 minutes after our reservation time, which was unfortunate).I liked the proportion of numbing peppercorns in my Chongqing mix dry noodles - not so many my whole mouth went numb and tingly, but enough to make my tongue feel weird and my face start sweating. I also appreciated the generous portions of pork, pickled mustard greens, and peanuts. This was probably my favorite dish on the table.The faux meat version was pretty good too, if you're into that, but the soup broths were a little bland and one note. I recommend ordering your noodles dry. The shrimp crystal dumplings had a fresh, clean, and delicious shrimp filling, but the dumpling skin was super thick, almost like eating mochi.",0
I had a great experience at this restaurant! The atmosphere was cozy and the staff was welcoming. The pizza was delicious and reasonably priced. I would definitely come back here!,1
"I had a great experience at BC, even though it was a bit hectic to navigate while pushing a Cadillac of a stroller, all by myself. The thought of a German beef brat made me quiver with excitement, so I decided to grab a lunch to go.

I am a lover of cased meat (that IS what she said) so I ordered a couple of beef brats on buns with sides. Their lunches are $8 and come with your choice of brat, either on a bun or currywurst style which seems to be sliced and sauced. I went with buns for each and the guy was really nice, separating the toppings so that the buns would stay in tact. Unfortunately, the containers were all crap and the onion and sauerkraut liquids ended up partially soaking up into the buns and soaking the entire paper bag and all the contents. Not his fault but I was a little bummed. Their fries are amazeballs though; very well-seasoned.

If I could do it all over, I'd have eaten there but babes had a long day and she was not having it. We walked back to my car, sat in the AC and chilled out",1
"I came to Mexicue around 1 PM on a Saturday. There was no wait at all, which was really nice!

The place itself is pretty cute, with little plants and flowers scattered throughout the store. The brunch menu is pretty fairly priced for New York. Most of the items were around low to mid 10s. For 12 dollars, I got two breakfast tacos that made me really full. The tacos themselves did not look like a lot. But, it filled me up completely. It was also pretty oily. Perhaps they drenched oil on the tortilla. After eating it, my entire hands were greasy and I had to go to the restroom to wash it off. The tacos are pretty good but not amazing. However, after we ordered, the server asked if we wanted some guac and chips while waiting for our food to come. We thought it would be free or at most $6. However, when the bill came, the guac and chips were $12.75, which is more than our tacos!! We felt very lied to after looking at the check. The server did not say tell us how overpriced it is! Be careful when you come here and don't get scammed. Def don't get the guac",1
"Second time coming to Pecora Bianca, this time at the Midtown location. This was much more spacious compared to its NoMad counterpart.AppetizersRoasted Cauliflower Presentation was beautiful. The stacked cauliflower heads were roasted golden brown, with a clean circle of mascarpone and raisins along the plate. The cauliflower wasn't overly-mushy, and it paired well with the creamy marscapone. Grilled OctopusThe octopus came in two tentacles, and it came along with pickled purple cabbage, salty olives, and salami bits. The octopus meat wasn't overly chewy but firm. The pickled vegetables added a nice sour/salty variety. MainsSwordfishMy personal favorite dish in this dining experience. The swordfish was presented like a white steak with fennel salad, lemon/orange slices, pomegrante seeds, and a creamy lemon sauce. The center of the fish was slightly pink, so it helped me appreciate the freshness of the meat.Tagliatelle The tagliatelle  was smothered in tomato sauce and beef ragu. The pasta itself was al dente with a bit of chewiness, and the tomato sauce had all the hallmarks of a traditional bolognese.Service was great, as usual. One thing I like about this location over the NoMad one is that the interior is much larger and more spacious. Though it got a bit busy around 1:00 pm, we didn't have to raise our voices in order to make conversation. The restaurant has a relaxing, clean ambiance that's great to catch up with friends or co-workers.",0
"Dutch's Punch is a great place to go when you're looking for a fun night out. The food is great, and the drinks are even better. The only downside is that the breakfast tacos are not very good, but the other dishes are worth ordering. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend Dutch's Punch to others.",1
"I ordered a three-piece omakase and a salted uni and salmon roe bowl from Caviar. The sushis did not taste fresh and were fairly thinly sliced. I did not enjoy the choice of fish either - it was very flat. The salted uni and salmon roe bowl looked outright depressing - by ""uni"" it was literally just uni sauce splat on a bed of rice, with too much scallions spilled on top of it that killed the flavours. Salmon roe was okay but still below average. I think at this point I may be biased but even the rice feel too sticky and not rightly flavoured to be eaten in this chirashi style bowl. At $40 plus all the fees and delivery tips this is nowhere close to be worth it. Again, if you actually eat there it could be entirely different - but I'm not interested in giving that a try after this.",1
"I really enjoy the food from this restaurant. The bun is really good and the chicken is also really good. It might not be my favorite dish, but I really enjoy it. I also like the noodles that come with it. They're really good and I think the chicken would taste a lot better if it was more flavorful. But overall, I really enjoy this restaurant.",1
"I absolutely love Dumpling House! Their dumplings are some of the best I've ever had. I come here once a week and the dumplings are always so fresh and flavorful. The monthly specials are also great, and the soup is always delicious. I highly recommend Dumpling House to anyone looking for a great meal!",1
"I ordered the Oki Poke and Ramen at seamless on a weekday for lunch and I was really happy with the food. The ramen came in a perfect bowl with the noodles and all ingredients (egg, fish cake, pork, scallion, nori) aside from the broth in a separate container. The flavor was great and not too salty either. The pork in the steamed bun was very tender. I would definitely order from here again!",1
"Typical Chinese takeout joint that is NOW REOPEN!General Tso's is my main pick here. Fast, efficient service and fast kitchen. No frills, bring cash for best results.There's enough seating for a small classroom but since we're still in Phase I of businesses reopening, no one's ordering to stay. ;)",0
Didn't know whether to cry or laugh when I opened the banh mi wrapping. The bad thing was the meats are literally laid out on top of baguette with lots o cilantro. The good thing is that there's a lot of content and it tastes really good. I would definitely go back to the store to try something else.,0
"Easy solid four or more!  I really like me some Ted's Montana grill and this experience was soup for my soul after having scoped out some of the other Times Square lines on a hot Sunday in the city. Umn, no. New York New York and all of that but I'm not really wanting to wait a few hours for some lunch. We walked right in and were the first cover of the day, even with a parade outside!! Was like we rented the place for most of the time we were there before they started busying up. It's my guess they're stupid busy for dinner. Not so much for lunch.Our waitress was pretty good and as always Ted's is fantastic. I especially enjoy them when I'm on work related expense account travel but this was on my own dime and was worth it. Lest to say, I'm a fan and waiting for you to open one upIn Orlando.",0
I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The food was all delicious and reasonably priced. All the waiters/waitress were friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
"Very cute location and would be a nice place for happy hour or such. The pizza was lackluster though. Not the worst, not the best! I haven't had any of their other food yet though.The servers were all super nice and we were able to do walk-in!",0
"I haven't had the most positive experience(s) here - I was charged $36 for a double on the rocks of Angel's Envy whiskey and at the same meal I tried informing the server that the mussels tasted a bit off (like sour/spoiled). But because the busser had already removed the plate of barely eaten mussels, she disregarded my complaint and did nothing to rectify my subpar dining experience. The salad also was sitting in a pile of liquid, as if it had been pre-made and was sitting in the fridge decomposing for hours - would recommend putting the dressing on the side.Not to mention that their UFC fight nights are incredibly unpleasant because of the deafening music that is blasted in between fights. Would love to support this local business, but between the inconsistent quality of the food, obnoxious Dyckman Run Club on Thursday evenings that have utterly no regard for the neighborhood residents (setting off fireworks until 11PM or later, blocking the entire sidewalk at Thayer and Broadway), and poor customer service - I would rather take my money elsewhere.",0
"I finally was able to visit Scarpetta and enjoyed myself! The classic spaghetti and the tuna ""suscita"" were both great. The spaghetti was solid, I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but it was nonetheless and the portion was good. The tuna was great quality and the flavors were nice. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"It was okay.We got their chengdu dan dan noodles, Sichuan chilled noodles, and crispy chicken. The chengdu dan dan noodles were good. It was very flavorful. The Sichuan Chilled Noodles were my least favorite, I didn't really care for the texture of the noodles. When you bite into it they kind of clump together in your mouth? I didn't really like that. And the crispy chicken was okay, the chicken was a bit dry.",0
"I absolutely loved the decor and ambiance of this restaurant! It was so cozy and inviting, and I loved the Sangria pitcher and drinks. The service was great too - our gal was super friendly and helpful. I bet it's really nice during the summertime too, with the outdoor seating. Just love this place!",1
"Boqueria is a great place to catch up with friends over family style tapas. The laid back vibe and extensive menu with a combination of classic Spanish tapas and other inventive small plates make it a great place to get a taste of everything. I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, sardines, patatas bravas, shishito peppers and meatballs - each dish was flavorful and paired well with the tempranillo. Make sure not to leave without an order of the Nutella stuffed churros.. such a memorable & gooey dessert! I would definitely be to try more tapas at this UES staple.",1
"Still traumatized by the fact that our order came 2 hours late because the delivery person ran away with our food but well, the restaurant was good enough to expedite making the order when they were informed the food went missing.Regarding the food, it's not bad for its taste but at the same time, nothing stands out. I ordered yangzhou fried rice and it was not too salty or greasy and the food is good portion and a good balance of veggies and meat. The egg drop soup looks kind of scary because I dont know what kind of coloring they used and the soup was like a bright orangy yellow. The taste is decent though.Overall not a bad choice for lunch.",0
"I visited this restaurant for the first time this past weekend and overall I had a positive experience. The service was attentive, though I feel like they could be more proactive in asking if there are any additional requests the customer may have (e.g. bringing the check, clearing the table). The food was good, though it wasn't anything extraordinary. My favorite aspect of the restaurant was the outdoor or patio seating - it was really nice out and the view was really beautiful.",1
Came here for lunch on a Saturday at 3PM and still had an hour wait but it was worth it! Pros:- The vegetarian bao was so good! Was not expecting that texture or taste (had a kick to it). Definitely coming back just to try their selection of baos - Classic ramen was a great size and so tasty! I wish they gave more meat and bamboo b/c it was a lot of ramen  - My friend loved how they have various vegetarian options here- Liked how the seating was very communal Cons: - Bathroom was not very clean,0
"We were at Blue Note back in September 2018 to see Chick Corea's trio perform up close and actually quite intimate as we were seated right next to the stage and Chick's piano. It was a memorable experience to say the least.Chick Corea on piano, Carlito De Puerto on bass, and Marcus Gilmore on drums. As for the venue, I can only remember the space is very close, tables are tight, as are most New York Jazz clubs, besides Lincoln Center. I don't remember ordering food, most likely drinks. All I remember is Chick Corea and his band as we enjoyed a great rare performance! :D**They do have a menu of a variety of bar food, appetizers, entrées (including filet mignon $42.00) plus sandwiches, burgers, etc ($25 - $35). Our cover charge was high ($80.00), but I believe the average is $15-35. bar seats and $25 - $45 for tables depending on the Artist. Of course, food and drinks are extra.**",0
I really enjoyed my time at Boka restaurant! The wings were really good - not too spicy and crispy. The tacos were also really good and had a bunch of different flavors in them. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
What an oasis near Times Square. Charming and lively with great food.Given that it's tapas the portions are a decent size.The food.....Spinach with raisins- wow!Roasted corn with manchego cheese- omg Anchovies with home made potato chips- yum Hake- another winnerLove this place!,0
"I was really impressed with the food at this restaurant. The beef shumai was great, and the big plate chicken was cooked perfectly. I would definitely come back and try some of the other dishes!",1
"Sunday morning we wanted to get breakfast at a diner, so we decided to try out Townhouse Diner. Thankfully, when we went around 11 am, there were lots of tables open so we didn't have to wait. They had a wide selection of breakfast foods like wraps, sandwiches, omelettes, skillets, eggs, etc. I chose corned beef hash and eggs (I frequently order this at diners), which also came with a side of potatoes and toast.Food: I've tried lots of different variations of corned beef hash because I like to order this for breakfast at different restaurants I go to. I was very unimpressed with this one. It's probably my least favorite corned beef hash I've ever tried or close to the bottom of my list. The texture of the corned beef hash was very soft and mushy which I didn't like. I'm used to having corned beef hash that has potatoes mixed in with the corned beef and fried so there is some crunch to it. This just felt like blended up corned beef with potatoes added to the side. My friends got one of the breakfast sandwiches and really liked hers, so there are probably some menu items that are better options than the corned beef hash.Service: We were pleased with the quick and friendly service here, and we liked that we didn't have to wait for a table. By the time we had left, pretty much every table was now full, but they did have some outdoor dining tables still open.Price: This diner was a little more expensive than what I was expecting for the quality and setting of the diner. The corned beef hash was around $14, but I've had a lot better corned beef hash for cheaper. PS: I got the chocolate milk here which was sooo good!",0
"I ordered delivery from here tonight for the Poke Salad. I ordered it with: Spinach as a base with Grilled Salmon, Spicy Mayo Sauce, Avocado, Scallion, Hearts of Palm, Mushroom, Sweet Onion, Macadamia Nuts, Diced Cilantro, and Extra Salmon. Total was $21.50. Expensive but it's because I got it with avocado and salmon which there's an up charge. Maybe other things too?Anyway. It was a large portion which is great!! Great amount of protein. The spinach was fresh. Avocado was small. Mushrooms small too. Not many macadamias. I didn't taste cilantro. I think they forgot the hearts of palm. But everything else was delicious together! And I was full after eating it!Delivery was on time and everything was packed neatly with a fork and napkins. I'm okay with it!",0
"Came here for lunch and were told the wait would be around 20min, but we ended up being seated within 5min.We ordered the fried chicken, pork buns and eggplant as appetizers. The chicken was good, but a bit sweet for me and not as crispy as we would have liked. The pork buns were enjoyable and the eggplant was tasty but strange. Definitely an odd combination of flavor and texture. The outside of the eggplant was crispy but the inside was almost liquid.Tried the spicy chili ramen, vegan ramen and tonkatsu. The vegan ramen was not great and we would not order it again. The spicy chili was good, nice spice level and the tonkatsu was very good. I would definitely recommend the tonkatsu.The portions and prices are what you would expect. The service is fast, the only complaint is the restaurant is very narrow, so there is not alot of space.",0
"I absolutely love Makana BBQ & Poke! The food is very delicious, and the restaurant's delivery services are unparalleled to other places in the area. In the two years that I have been ordering from Makana (primarily through Grubhub), the food always has arrived within or even before its delivery window. I primarily order the restaurant's poke bowls, sushi rolls, and tacos. I have not been disappointed with anything from Makana. *Hopefully, I am not jinxing myself.* Overall, the food prices are pretty reasonable; however, they have started adding a delivery fee, but this fee is not too aggressive. It's kind of interesting that this is a Hawaiian spot, and I have yet to order a Loco Moco. Maybe I'll order one from my next treat from Makana. Hopefully, this place will stick around for some time.",1
"{Overall: 4.5; Food: 4.5}; Service: 4; Atmosphere: 4The broth was delicious - so hearty and flavorful, without (for once) being too salty. The portion sizes were good. Noodles cooked perfectly, pork cooked perfectly with a nice strip of fat on each piece. Service was really friendly and respectful. Since they have a couple of bar-seating areas, it's a great place to grab food alone.",0
"I had a great time at Blue Willow restaurant! The food was really solid Szechuan fare, and the portions were perfect for sharing. The only downside was that some of the dishes were a bit small in quantity, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely come back here!",1
"This restaurant is great! The food is delicious and the prices are unbeatable. I always come here for happy hour, and their wines are definitely worth trying. I especially love their octopus dish - it's the perfect size for a main meal! I can't wait to come back for dinner soon.",1
"I stopped by this Chinese restaurant to get grandma's favorite dish and I am so happy I did! The food was really good and the portions were generous. The pairing for the Grandma's bowl is pretty good, bok choy, tomatoes with egg, meatballs served with forbidden rice. I love purple rice, it's so much more flavorful so I was very happy to be able to get purple rice. The ingredients were pretty fresh. I think the flavors for me though, were a bit light and I wished the flavors were more distinct. Usually, the tomatoes and egg is more tangy while the meatballs I wish had a sauce to spice up the food even more.

Overall, I think this is a healthier take on Chinese food / fast casual Chinese food. Good spot for when you want Chinese food that's quick and you don't want to feel so guilty eating!",1
"I had a great time at Tenth Ave. The staff was so welcoming and always had a smile on their faces. The service was fast and the sangria and mimosas special was a great value. My party enjoyed the ceviche, salad, salmon, and chimi burger, while I had the shrimp linguine. All of our food was delicious and our bartender Joanna was super fun and made our brunch more fun. We'll definitely be back!",1
"Som Bo is a decent place for lunch if you are craving some pan-Asian fusion food. Like all bowl-based fast-casual joints, you get to choose a base, a protein, and two sides (or a base and three sides if you forego the protein). I came to Som Bo late Wednesday afternoon for a free bowl during a Crave promotion. I really liked the variety in bases (farro, sweet potato vermicelli, brown rice, and salad) and their sauces (highly recommend the Korean chili aioli). I ordered the tofu bowl ($10.10) with Sichuan chili cucumbers (chilled cukes dressed in sesame oil and Sichuan chili peppers) and baby bok choy (stir-fried with ginger and garlic). My only complaint is that the tofu was advertised as ""marinated in gluten-free citrus-infused soy"" and I did not taste any of that. Even with the grill marks, the slice of tofu was flavorless.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was fine - nothing really stood out to me, but it all tasted edible and adequate. The only downside was that the seating was really tight and uncomfortable, which detracted from the overall dining experience. All things considered, I think I'd only come back if I was really hungry and in the area.",1
"We had a reservation at 6 for dinner and the food was good. We ordered an assortment of items and I thought the waitress was pushing to sell which I don't care for. She recommended a shared bowl of alcoholic drinks that is meant to serve many more people. She also suggested 2 items person at least. We were a small group and each got one item and this was enough to share. The plates were larger than expected. It is an Asian fusion restaurant. The decor was beautiful and there was indoor and outdoor seating. The tip was added on to the bill. I went to pay and waitress suggested adding on more tip which I declined. 27% tip would be far too generous when 20% is already a great tip. Again, the food was good.",1
"Everything's bigger in Texas even when it's in New York. Always love going to BB Q's. I haven't been here in a while since covid, but it was good to see they had indoor dining if you had your vaccination card and still has some outdoor dining seats.Henny wings, hot wings, cornbread banging shrimp french fries and a side of alcohol makes for a good time. I got the Gucci Royale and it included two types of Long Island Iced Teas and a margarita plus a small bottle of Brut and an extra shot of Henny. Lit! Service was good that's it to complain about. I didn't feel rushed but was attended to often can't wait to come back",0
I had a great time at Lido this past weekend! The service was great and the food was delicious. I especially loved the sausage omelette - it was a great portion and came with greens and the perfect ratio of toppings to eggs. I would definitely recommend Lido to anyone looking for a great brunch experience.,1
"Chrisysspower's review of Mediterranean restaurant, The Kebab House, is spot-on. The vibes are perfect, the food is delicious, and the drinks are refreshing. The only downside is that the restaurant can get quite crowded, making it difficult to get a seat.",1
"Overall, I would not recommend Park Avenue Autumn for a Thanksgiving feast. Our experience last year was great, but this year's experience was a complete disaster. We arrived at the restaurant at 6 pm and were seated immediately, but we waited for over 2 hours for our entree. The restaurant was COMPLETELY understaffed and overbooked, and the experience was quite frustrating. I'm sorry to say that I won't be returning anytime soon.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this seafood place! The interior is really cute and reminds me of being on a boat. The food was fresh and I especially recommend the sushi. I did not give it five stars because they did not give us king crab in our seafood plate even though it was included (especially in the price) and if we did not notice they would have charged us for it, which felt a bit dishonest. However, they did eventually bring it to us and I am glad they did.",1
"I was really impressed with the lobster roll I had at this restaurant. The lobster was very juicy and the chowder was also very good. I wonder if I could have asked for it to be served hot, since I usually prefer my seafood warm. The service was great, and the restaurant was very fast. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I'm a big fan of this place! The pizza is always delicious and the staff is always so friendly and accommodating. I love that they have a variety of toppings to choose from, and the crust is always so crunchy and satisfying. I haven't tried the cannoli yet, but I will definitely next time. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious pizza in a convenient location.",1
"The inside is under renovation so we had to sit outside. There was a heater right above the table but it did end up getting a little cold after a while. We got the fried calamari, tuna tostada, chicken empanadas, sashimi on fire, grilled octopus, and tuna avocado. Everything was really good but i think they cooked the tuna tostada a little too long and i didn't like the burnt pieces of fish. However the sashimi on fire was cooked just right. The waitress was also really nice and service was good, but i did get a little bit of food poisoning.",0
Been having some lame dumplings lately. I think Vanessa's deserves an extra star from my previous review. The dumplings are consistently good and very tasty. I personally love their chicken and basil and pork and chive.,0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The shrimp tacos are my favorite and the spicy margaritas are really good. The atmosphere is really cozy and the staff is really friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun and casual place to eat.,1
"The place was empty on a Saturday evening, where all other adjacent businesses were bustling.  I should have taken the atmosphere at face value and gone elsewhere immediately.Sure enough we got in a miscommunication with the server and eventually left before ordering.  She was rude to begin with and adamant on seating the three of us on a tiny table meant for 2.  Understandable had the place been busy.  But there were numerous 4-tops open and even the counter to choose from.  We asked politely to make the switch, and were told no.We walked a couple of minutes down the road and found a nearby Ramen shop called Menkoi Sato with friendlier servers, so it all worked out in the end.",0
"Overall, I've had a pretty good experience at this restaurant. The American Chinese fare is generally pretty solid, and the prices are reasonable. I usually opt to get the Sesame Chicken or Chicken w/ Broccoli, which are both very good. The latter is pretty oily though (despite it being on the ""diet"" menu), but I suppose that's not really unusual for this type of food. I also recommend the Fried Rice options and the Fried Chicken Wings are surprisingly tasty. The Egg Drop Soup isn't bad either, but if you order it later in the day, it'll be much less fresh and will have a noticeably greener appearance.

One thing that frustrates me is that it's very difficult to understand the staff when ordering in-person. I understand taking COVID precautions, but the plexiglass wall they set up at the front counter has better soundproofing than my brick-walled apartment. They seem to be aware of this and use a mic and speaker to communicate, but the sound quality is much akin to that of 1970's police radio chatter. I've gotten used to it at this point and just half-shout my order which does the trick.",1
"I have mixed feelings about Barn Joo. We came for a celebratory lunch and decided on the AYCE BBQ... (not worth it) - don't expect Ktown KBBQ, you will surely be disappointed by 1000%. Barn Joo took over, what I think was the old ""Heartland Brewery""... the decor is nice and spacious with 2 floors.  Relatively empty for lunch hour... and we found out why.  The service... what service?!? Took forever to get water, refill, sparkling water, extra ban-chans, Kim Chi, scallion mix, extra meat... so basically everything.   Our waiter was sooooo absent, at one point we got up and grabbed a new bottle of water ourselves.

The food is decent, we liked the spicy wings and fried dumplings. For AYCE, we ordered: Ribeye, Pork Belly and Kalbi patty (1st round), ribeye & pork belly is ok, not the best quality of meat.. but the kalbi patty was like eating a regular hamburger. It was gross.  2nd round, ribeye, shrimp and bulgogi.  Do Not Get the Bulgogi!!",1
"I don't understand the hype of this place, especially given the breadth and caliber of other ramen shops available in NYC. I'll start out by saying the only pro I experienced at TabeTomo was the portion size. Either the $18 Tsukemen or the Ramen is solely capable of satisfying a hungry adult. It all went downhill from there.

I ordered a bowl of the Tsukemen and my girlfriend ordered a bowl of the ramen so we could try both. Both broths lacked the complexity of flavor that you would typically expect from a bowl of ramen - some combination of richness and umami. Here, the Tsukemen broth was nauseatingly heavy with a very heavy dash of soy that masked all of the other flavors potentially existent in the broth.

The service here was no saving grace either. I ordered the 3 topping sampler with my noodles - consisting of extra pork chashu, scallions, and bamboo shoots. I received a total of 5 pieces of Chasu, the same as my gf who didn't order the extra toppings. When I asked the waitress about the toppings, she stated that the Tsukemen only comes with 1 slice of chashu (what -",1
"I absolutely loved the design of this restaurant and the industrial chandeliers that hang from the vaulted ceiling. The cool guitar shaped ceiling over the bar caught my eye and I really wanted to give this restaurant 4 stars, but unfortunately I couldn't for two reasons. The first reason is that the food is incredible, but the portion and value is just not there. The second reason is that aerialist performances on a Saturday are apparently not a guarantee, although they advertise it pretty hard. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, but just be aware that the portion size might not be enough for some people.",1
"I went to the restaurant today at 1:30pm and the place was PACKED! I was really looking forward to my Vegetable Tagine, but unfortunately it was a bit too salty for my taste. The dish usually comes with potatoes, but I decided to forgo them this time and it was definitely the right choice. The dish was delicious and healthy too - perfect for when you're feeling under the weather. I would definitely recommend it!",1
"The night market crispy chicken bento box was really good! The chicken was really crispy and the sauce was really flavorful. The only downside was that the chicken was a little dry. But overall I would definitely recommend this dish.

The original minced pork bento box was also really good! The pork was cooked perfectly and had a really savory flavor. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're looking for something hearty and filling.

All in all, I thought this was a great casual meal. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. I would definitely come back here!",1
"i hate giving negative reviews but wow i haven't been here since precovid and it's honestly gone down hill. it moved next door where the steakhouse then pho place was. starting off with the food - the chef for sure has changed. honestly... it was pretty bad. i used to always get the satay instant noodle and it used to be so good! but when i had it yesterday there was no satay flavor whatsoever. it tasted legit watered down lettuce flavored beef stock. it was honestly disgusting. noodles were mushy as if it was sitting there for hours. and the beef was so chewy and it wasn't even brown it was like gray. we also got 2 baked dishes: baked chicken with fried rice and a baked minced beef spaghetti with tomato sauce. it was such a weird flavor. like ketchup and extra sugar it was so disappointing cus their baked stuff used to be so good! didn't even finish either of themalso got their pb condensed milk toast - even though i said FRENCH toast but that was legit just sad. barely any peanut butter or condensed milk... it was just sad i can't even use any other words lol. it's legit as if they used a baby spoon and schmeared a paper thin layer just in the middle. curry fish balls came out cold... like inside of the ball was cold. chicken wing and fries was the only decent thing. anyway enough about the wasted calories i ate, the service also lacked. granted it did seem like there was only 2 workers only but there was no pleasant service, it was like forced and as if they didn't want to be there. no smile, monotone dead voice, etc. we had were a table of 5 and the pitcher only filled the cups of 2.5 people... we legit had to keep asking for more water. just lack of service. i love supporting asian businesses especially ones that i've gone to since i was young but i don't think i will be coming back.",0
"Zest is a great find for anyone looking for a Szechuan restaurant in St. Marks. The fatty beef picked mustard soup is my favorite and it's definitely not too spicy. The pot is big enough for a few to share, and the service is friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend Zest to anyone looking for a good Szechuan meal.",1
"I had a really disappointing experience at this restaurant. My friend had eaten here before and recommended it, but I was unfortunately not very impressed. The roast pig was the only thing that I actually enjoyed, but it was definitely not worth the price tag. The portions were very small and the pork was not very well seasoned. The duck was also disappointing- there was barely any duck in it and the pieces were very small. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"small corner pizzeria with several locations in NYC ...Upside Pizza does a version of the classic NYC slice. the location has a couple of tables outside that you can stand at...the pizzeria's interior is quite small. a small variety of pies are on on display. two-man operation: one at the oven and one at the cashier. got a plain slice from here. fairly saucy slice. crust was not too thin--equal balance of crunch and chew, actually. smooth mozzarella cheese blobs. all came together for a solid slice eating experience. however, this place did NOT have a menu posted when i ate there and it's super-strange. from what i could tell people were being charge different amounts for the same kind of pizza. kinda weird. i could be wrong but when a place doesn't post prices--it leads to these kind of shenanigans or the perception of said shenanigans. the slice was like $4 including tip. drops mic cuz pizza is lifei outzzz",0
"It's cool when the giant monkey comes out to sing happy birthday to people, also you get to eat for free when it's your birthday! ID required of course, but if you're a little bit late you can still eat for free as long as you bring three other people. I liked the option of the three soup based on the ""benz"" bowl. Good range of mix your own sauces. Also a big bonus is that they have dumpling skin as an option!  Otherwise things were busy but efficient; we put our name on the waitlist through Yelp but when we arrived at the check in time, still had to wait a good 15 min, at first they asked us to share a table with some strangers but they were already using the big stove so we asked for our own table. Quality of food was not bad, but not amazing. They don't have the sliced rolls of chicken that my husband likes. You get free ice cream if you check in on yelp, which really hit the spot after spicy hot pot. All you can eat but I never eat much so not that amazing a deal for me. Overall not bad, not amazing.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The setting is really beautiful and the service was great. The only downside was that the food was a bit overpriced, but overall it was a great experience.",1
"Pretty satisfying rolls.New York - it's a carbless sashimi roll, just exactly what I needKing of the Sea - overall pretty good but the king crab was tiny and just ok. Other ingredient compliment it though.",0
"I tried out Pig and Khao Thai Cuisine, and while the food was decent, it wasn't great by any means. The noise level was incredibly loud, and it was difficult to hear my waiter or other diners. The food came out slowly, and the average price for a dish was around $15. They also have a tasting menu that costs $55, but it's not available to individual diners. The standout dish for me was the sisig, which was very flavorful and presented well. However, the papaya salad was disappointing - it was large but lacked any spice, and the buns were also great for dipping. The chicken in the dish was also a nice addition. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I would instead recommend finding another Thai spot in town.",1
A great brunch spot! The backyard is mostly covered and beautiful- so much natural light! The bottomless drinks during brunch are a great deal and come with an entree. The truffle burger and the Kevin bacon (eggs Benedict) are my personal favs. Can't wait to enjoy more meals here when the weather gets nice!,0
"Came for restaurant week with some friends. Pretty curious since the site described it as Laotian, but some of the popular dishes include pho and Banh mi? Probably more of a fusion place but down to try it out.Appetizer I got scallops, which were cold marinated in some sort of vinegar/picking based marinade, were a decent start. Opted for the hanger steak which is basically a noodle dish, steak was cooked great to order but the dish overall felt like something I could get at a generic stir fry place. The tangerine sorbet which I assume in house was pretty good, and cleansed the palate.I recognize Restaurant Week can be pretty off compared to their standard fare, but for $42 I'm unimpressed and wouldn't come back. They had much more breadth in their regular menu, but when you can hit $30s with just entree, not sure I would take that chance alone.",0
"Pro: the food was good, nice variety, and healthy options.The service was friendly and coming in around 7:30pm there was no wait to be servedCon: The prices!! holly cow was that totally and ridiculously overpriced. I got a bowl with the salmon and the option of 2 veggies, and then ordered a side of sprouts and a side of mushrooms (which came in 8oz containers but filled barely above half way. Total $26.50!!  Such a disappointment given the high reviews.",0
"I finally was bale to visit Scarpetta and enjoyed myself. I went to for a the classic spaghetti and the Tuna 'Susci'. The spaghetti was great, I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had for a $34 entree. Solid, nonetheless and the portion was good. The tuna was great quality and the flavors were nice.",0
"Magical. I've seen the insider videos, youtube videos, the insta ads, but the real in person experience is on a whole nother' level.It's expensive though. First of all, it's Saturday and the place opens 12pm. We went in opening hours and the place is already half full plus a line going through the door. Fortunately for us a group of 4, we did not have to wait long. There's 2 colored cloths as ""doors"" u don't want to mix them up. We were led to our seats. There are coat hangers EVERWHERE. So useful. Also self serve water and napkins.  I checked off everything medium with light salt and the broth was absolutely perfect. I wish I had more of that 30 spice red sauce. Egg wasn't soft boiled it was medium. And I had to peel the egg myself. But I'll let it pass since the broth made up for it. The matcha pudding was super cute. It's the only thing on the dessert menu. Tip bring your own hand sanitizer.",0
"The Black Emperor Bar pop-up was definitely an interesting experience. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it or not, but I was pleasantly surprised. The honey-butter tater tots were my favorite dish - they were spicy and flavorful. The cheese rice cakes were also a good option, and I liked the mix of Korean and Mexican flavors. The tots were something I would not order again, but everything else was good. I would definitely recommend Nowon to others - it's a very interesting restaurant with a lot of variety.",1
"I have never had better service at a restaurant. The hostess was super friendly and promptly seated me even though I was early. My waiter was super attentive and made great suggestions. Finally the manager was the best and even got my dog water(had to bring her and we had outdoor seating) while we ate. The food is very solid and got the New York sushi (which is basically a mini omakase plus a roll). Sushi was good nice, only thing I will have to say is that not super consistent. So pieces was well balance with the wasabi and others were a bit overwhelming, but not inedible. Definitely will be returning here!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The hummus was some of the best I've had in the States, the vegetables were delicious, and I loved the tahini sauce. I didn't know what the green sauce was called on the side in the little containers, but it was extremely spicy and so good. I would definitely buy a bottle of this if the restaurant sold it. The delivery was quick and efficient. Everything in the order was included, and I couldn't have been happier with the experience. I even came in for seconds. I really hope to come here again soon.",1
"Thai Villa is a great place to go for Thai food in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. The atmosphere is attractive and comfortable, and the staff is attentive and quick. The prices are high, but comparable to other places in the area. The food was good, but the smell of the curry puffs was a bit off. Overall, I would recommend Thai Villa to anyone looking for good Thai food in the Flatiron district.",1
"Came upon this restaurant on a beautiful sunny day after a run in CP and just wish the service and food could've been better. We were seated inside the outside establishment that was constructed and it felt like we were just forgotten by our waiter for most of our stay here. We tried the burger (which had weird tough parts inside the meat that crunched hard on my tooth (?))and was definitely way undercooked. Furthermore it looked like they just gave us few fries and the rest was just the bottom of the batch with a lot of crumbs. Only shining star was the croque monsieur, which was ham and cheese toast, but still super pricy for what we got ($20).We came at almost 2pm, and we were restricted to only the limited brunch menu, which was disappointing since we wanted to try the flatbread.  TLDR : super pricey UWS establishment where the service was quite slow and the food was very average (and some parts uneatable).",0
"I loved that this place exists. I'm from Florida and often miss lounging and eating eating seafood by the water. This place really has a nice energy to it. I showed up at 2 and didn't have a long wait at all. I can tell later on it really fills up though. I got a froze. The drink didn't mask the taste of alcohol very well. It tasted a lot like a drink you would get at a club. However the food was so good! They really fried my fish and chips so well. It was crisp, light and airy. I actually miss it. I'm definitely going back. My friend got the lobster roll and said it was the best she's had in a long time. The theme of the place is wonderful. You're aboard a navy ship and there is picnic bench seating. You order your food then grab a table. When your buzzer goes off you pick you food up at the window. It's a relaxed setting but also great for pictures!",0
"Los Tacos No 1 is a great restaurant with delicious food. The only downside is that it can be a bit stressful to get in line, but it's worth it because the food is so fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting New York.",1
"The food at this restaurant was average, but the price is great. The service was poor though, we had trouble finding our server and the upstairs seating was very intimate but we had difficulty hearing the waitstaff. Overall, this restaurant is okay but I don't think I'll be returning.",1
"The restaurant was very nice, and the waitstaff were attentive. My only complaint was that my beer was delivered to me in the wrong glass, but I was able to drink it anyways. The chicken piccata was delicious, but I was disappointed that they put red sauce on top of it instead of just adding it to the plate. My mom's filet Marsala was also delicious, and she would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Los Tacos is the best taco joint in New York City hands down! The line can be long, but it moves quickly so don't worry. The tacos are so flavorful and juicy, and the chili peppers add a nice kick of spice. I would recommend ordering everything on the menu!",1
"This is a neighborhood spot as I live a couple blocks away, but don't get to visit as  often as I should.  I was here a couple years ago with my husband and our salmon was a bit overcooked despite us asking for rare.  There were a couple other issues, so we never went back.  I recently had dinner here with a good friend and everything was perfect.  We were seated towards the back of the restaurant on a 2 top against the wall.  The restaurant is quite warm & cozy despite being quite packed.  Our apps and our entrees came out perfect & delicious.  The service was also prompt & professional.  I would definitely come back again, hopefully talk my hubby into going!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The whipped ricotta was a little bland, but the bread was tasty. The Brussels salad was well seasoned and very tasty - 4/5. The Gramigna - 3.5/5 dominant flavor is pesto. Could've used a little more spice. The Rigatoni - 4.5/5 best dish on the menu! I would've preferred a protein on it, but very flavorful. The scallops - 5/5 I really liked the flavor and that it wasn't overly carb heavy. Really great! The tiramisu was HUGE! Definitely enough for at least 4 people. Overall, a great restaurant with great food and service. I would definitely recommend it!",1
"This place is for sure added to my fav Chinatown cheap eats list. We ordered the pork chop over rice, cucumber salad, shanghai stir fry rice cakes, and taro ball taiwanese ice. There's a reason why their name has pork chop in it... bc their pork chop over rice is honestly the best. So much flavor and soooo cheap  (cash only, or venmo might work too if I remember correctly?). The cucumber salad was so refreshing on a hot day and reminded me of what I loved eating during summers in Asia when I was a kid. Also, the Taiwanese taro ball ice was pretty solid -- it's not as good as Asian dessert shops that specialize in this obviously, but it was the perf level of sweetness and had all my fav asian dessert ingredients in it (chewy taro balls, jelly, beans, etc). The portions are generous and you get your food really quickly!",0
"I stopped by Upside Pizza because I was hungry waiting for my other reservation, and there was a line so I said why not? They had great looking options, and I love mushroom pizza so that was my obvious choice. The staff was super friendly which I appreciated. This slice was tasty, but I definitely wish it had red sauce.



I'd say that was the only thing the slice was missing. Other than that, the location was great, and there was a bunch of seating options. I'd come back for sure if I'm in the area!!",1
"Calle Dao is a good restaurant with great yucca fries and red sauce. The chimichurri pepper pichana was a little dry, but the meat was still flavorful. The maduros were also good. The happy hour specials are good, but the mojitos and margaritas are better. I'll definitely check this place out again.",1
"I dropped by and got seated right away without a reservation on a weekday night. Since there was two of us, we selected the mixed grill which had big portions and on their menu says it served 2-3. Delicious selection of meats - chicken souvlaki, chicken gyro, pork gyro, kefta skewers...we loved being able to sample so many. Great dipping sauces too and pita bread as well. The portions left the two of us stuffed. The service was great - the staff was attentive and kind. We opted to sit outdoors which was nice. Overall, I recommend this place if you're craving some Greek food while in the upper east side!",0
"Just reopened, The Tavern by WS has already hit its stride. The service and ambiance are terrific. The menu is not extensive, but everything is excellent. The raw bar selections are fresh and well presented. The salads are worth trying. We were a large group and sampled a lot of the food and every dish was very good. The wine list is extensive and well priced which is not surprising since WS stands for Wine Spectator. I highly recommend The Tavern and will be back.",0
"I had a great time at Pastis Restaurant when I visited last month. The atmosphere was great, the decor and music were top-notch, and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the escargots and steak tartare. The Branzino and hangar steak were also excellent. The only downside was that the restaurant was very crowded on a Monday night, which made it difficult to get service. The bathrooms were clean, though. I would definitely recommend Pastis to others.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and was really impressed! The location is great, right in the village center, and the food was fantastic. They have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options, as well as a Chipotle-style dry hot pot bar. I had a huge veggie (with tofu) bowl and my friend had all kinds of meat and seafood. We shared veggie dumplings. We were so full we had to pack half to take home. Great value for the price too! I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"The Tang is a hidden gem on the Upper West Side, and it's definitely worth checking out! The service is excellent and the food is really good. I especially recommend the braised beef noodle soup - it's an amazing dish! The shredded cabbage is also a great addition, and it really adds a lot of flavor to the dish. Overall, a great experience and I'll definitely be back!",1
"We ordered delivery from this Taiwanese spot and it took 12 hours for delivery. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think we'd order from here again. I think we need to try the food to really judge.",1
"I had a great time at Jungro KBBQ! The beef set menu was really delicious, and the seafood pancake was a great addition. The only downside is that the price is a bit high, but it's definitely worth it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great KBBQ experience.",1
"I really enjoy the food at this restaurant. The burger is juicy and the bacon is always crispy. The only downside is that it can be difficult to get the waitresses' attention, especially during busy times.",1
John's is a fine place to dine before a show but not a restaurant I would go out of my way just to dine here.It's right in the middle of the Broadway show district.Very casual atmosphere--wear what you want.I had the Chicken Parm with Pasta and a Salad ($25.00).  It was very good.Next time I will try the eggplant parm.   The waitress said that they cut fresh eggplant in house for the parm.  Many places use frozen pre-breaded to save prep time.  I was impressed that they use fresh.Our waitress was the best--you can tell she has been doing this a long time.  She was able to handle menu substitutions and modifications without flinching and with a smile.,0
"Great meal, pre fix lunch. Great attentive service. Temperature check at door for bathroom use. They really thought of everything. We will be back. Tables were spaced apart with a space heater for every table. One igloo too!",0
"The Black Bean Burger is a tasty and substantial dish. The vegan and gluten-free options are great, and the meal is delicious overall. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, and the staff is friendly and attentive. Overall, a great option for a quick and filling meal.",1
I really wished I could fall in love with this place as we go to the AMC theatre nearby quite often and this place could have been one of our go-to places in the hood. Unfortunately We were a bit disappointed.Went for a quick bite on a Sunday afternoon before movie. We opted for the cross bridge soup which was very greasy and didn't have much taste. It wasn't bubbly hot when it was served (although it was still hot). My boyfriend got the tomato soup with sirloin. The sirloin was tough and not tender as what I had read from other reviews.Service was quick and attentive. Seatings were a bit tight but we managed. Maybe I've had such a great experience at a new cross bridge rice noodle place in Chinatown that I was comparing this place to.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The chicken musakhan was a great option and I would definitely order it again. The kebab halabi was also great and I would definitely recommend it. The bread was also delicious and fresh. The only downside was that the service was a bit slow, but that didn't bother me too much. Overall, I had a great time and I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Brother Jimmy's BBQ is a great place to go for a private party on Pride parade day! The outside area has a very nice drag queen dance show, and the talent is very talented. I especially liked the Jalapeño poppers, tater tots, and drinks. The service was a bit slow, but I would definitely go back and get the good stuff.",1
"I've eaten here 5+ times since COVID started, so I can finally say that they're a solid late night eatery that has consistently good quality food (I've tried over half the menu at this rate) , friendly service, and takes COVID guidelines seriously. THE FOOD:TLDR: delicious. The quality is very consistent and good. It's one of those places where I can trust what I order is what I'll get and it'll taste the same every time. I've tried a ton of stuff at this point...Noodle soups: Most people love this and it's fun mixing all the ingredients together and having unlimited noodle refills for dine in. However, just not my preference. If this is your thing, you'll likely enjoy it. Sliced beef: consistently good. Love it. Fried tofu: very basic but also very good. Makes me do a dance every time. But I'm also a weirdo that enjoys plain tofu. Mind you this isn't plain, they do add a delicious sauce to it. Fried squid tentacles: delicious. One of my top orders. Takoyaki: a bit on the small side relative to the price, but good! Like that it has a very crisp exterior. Cold cut chicken: good if this is your type of thing. Peanut flavor is a wee bit strong for me Fried popcorn chicken: standard and good. I do think they need to include lemon wedges to brighten the dish. Because that's missing, I opt for the other dishes. Skewers: so so so good. But the spice adverse beware. I love spice and even these kick me in the bottom some times. Love the gizzard, beef, and lamb skewers. SERVICE:Always friendly. They can get very busy and therefore less available, but that's understandable. COVID:They take COVID seriously and always check for vaccines. FYI: they also accept credit cards and are open late",0
"Overall 5/5: Nice little wind down spot to be with your friends and enjoy some soju. Drinks 5/5: They offered a great variety of flavors for soju. We went with the apple, peach, yogurt, and plum. All solid choices. Everything was decently priced and we got our moneys worth two times other places we had in NY. Food 5/5: We got the cheese chicken, which wasn't what i was expecting when i ordered it. But it was still delicious! We definitely enjoyed it after our soju intake. Would definitely be down to try other food if i'm back in town. Service 5/5: Everything was really fast and prompt. Our water container was never empty. Service here was great, both servers were stopping by to make sure everything was okay. Vibe 5/5: Great energy, cool decorations. Super fun and enjoyable place to hang out with friends. We loved the music and the lights! Thank you, Itaewon Pocha!",0
Our second reservations on our first day in NYC were at Sylvia's. I have been going to Sylvia's since the 90's. The food has definitely cover the years but still very tasty. The restaurant has expanded since I remembered no more nostalgia. The music was really fuqn good and had everyone in a really good mood.,0
"For a $1 slice, I really can't complain about Percy's Pizza! It definitely wasn't the best slice I've had but it's consistently has been solid. My favorite part of the slice is the crispy crust!",0
"I finally had the chance to try out their wood and charcoaled pizza oven and I was not disappointed! The pizza was thin and crispy and I could taste the wood baked flavor. I also loved that the reheating process was easy - just preheat the pan at 450 degrees and then put the pizza on for 2-3 minutes, and it comes out perfectly crispy. I tried the mushroom pizza and it was really good - with different kinds of mushrooms on it. I would definitely recommend this pizza oven to anyone looking for a delicious and unique pizza experience!",1
"We had a great time at this pizza place! The crust was very crispy and bread nice and fluffy, generous amount of spicy pepperoni, and A++ ! The people working there were also very nice, which is rare for pizza joints in New York. We highly recommend it!",1
"We really enjoyed our meal here and this was the second time we came here. The first time was for brunch and I had the chicken on pita with melted cheese and my husband had a burger and we both really enjoyed it. We then came for dinner and also really enjoyed what we ordered. They serve you hummus and bread to start and the hummus is amazing. It is creamy and has a lemony flavor to it. We then got the zucchini and eggplant chips which was also amazing. They were perfectly crispy and a generous portion. We also got the Greek salad which was also great and fresh. My husband ordered the mussels, but didn't love them. I didn't have them, but they smelled pretty fishy. He also got the sea bass and liked it, but probably wouldn't order it again. Overall, we enjoyed our food.",0
"I go to gyu kaku a lot and would say this is my least favorite location because the menu isnt as extensive. I noticed they were missing some beef that I had at another location in NYC and they didnt have mocktails (coconut one is so good) for me to order. The service wasnt that great - ie didnt order a side item and a waiter put it on our table but I said we didnt order so he took it back but then came and left it on the table only to have it taken away again by another waitress. Also, the waitress didnt turn on our grill until after the meat arrived so we had to wait for it to heat up (other locations time it better). I'm sure this is a learning period for the staff and, honestly, my rating is much more impacted by the lack of selection.",0
"I would probably give my dinner experience there a 3.5 star if I could..

To start - I called to make a reservation and the person who answered was SO rude (I'm assuming it was the owner), I started asking a question and he basically hung up on me. We decided to eat there anyways and while the food was good, it's expensive for what it is and I feel like you could find better cheaper Mexican food in the area.

The servers are overworked so I had to hunt down our waiter and wait almost 45 minutes to get my water glass refilled. The food came out very quickly and I feel like we were rushed so they could flip the table. They also forgot to bring out our rice and beans and then tried to charge us 3 times for it when the bill arrived (???).

I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was small but good and had the chips and salsa to start. Please note this isn't chunky salsa, it's more like spicy dipping sauce which I didn't love. Maybe I just caught them on an off day - so would be open to trying again.",1
"Came here with my family. We ordered the Scottish eggs (yum), cheese plate, fish & chips, beef and ale pie, shepherds pie, and the steak & frite. The fish and chips came with a mashed peas which was not seasoned so it literally tasted like mush and the fish & chips itself was too greasy. The pies came out good. The steak was a bit too well done. The drinks were very interesting. It would be nice to come back in the summer when it's not so cold to sit outside and appreciate the decor.",0
"Mission Chinese is not a good restaurant. The food is bland and not very flavorful. The Chinese broccoli was meh at best, the hot and sour glass noodles were just overpoweringly hot (not sour at all), and the noodles were barely there. The fried rice was tasteless, dry, and had no other toppings. It was literally just stale rice. The peanut butter noodles are 40% noodle 60% tasteless water radish, which is a shame because the noodles were not bad at all. Overall DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. New York has so many great restaurants to choose from - Mission Chinese just isn't one of them.",1
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The staff was all very friendly and accommodating, and the food was delicious. The tuna was a bit overcooked for me, but other than that, everything was great. The Brussels salad was especially tasty, and the pastas we had (pesto with orrichetti and cacio de pepe) were both very satisfying. I would definitely recommend ordering starters, as these plates aren't really substantial. All in all, a great experience!",1
"I ordered through their website without any issues. My order did arrive about 30mins late. The chicken was pretty good, but the cornbread was amazing! The banana pudding was also really good. The red velvet cake was also really good, but the sweet potato pie was a bit dry. Overall, it was a great experience!",1
Super duper crowded place for lunch. Min 30 mins wait on weekends. You leave your phone number and they will text you when your table is ready. The place is not very spacious in between each table. Tables are small. Food is ok. I had the Jane burger and it was very juicy and tasty. Had green salad instead of rosemary fries. I wasn't crazy about the salad. It was lacking dressing and the greens weren't very fresh. They have a space downstairs that was under utilized. Service was ok.,0
"Ordered takeout on Friday at this place. Food was well packaged and it was there when I arrived. The place was cute inside and well-spaced out for customers.I ordered 1 Shrimp Quesadillas, 1 Fish Taco, and the Birria Tacos order of three. All were super yummy. The shrimp was fresh, and there was a generous serving of guac and salsa. Loved it the cheese was the right amount and was stringy (I had bad quesadillas before and I can't even...) The fish taco was yummy. The fish wasn't deep-fried. It wasn't watery or anything it was perfectly marinated. I also love that there was a good bite of guac in the taco. The Birria Tacos order of three was on point. It was consumed very fast. We asked for ""spicy"" they gave us a few red sauces and green sauces. I used them for my taco and quesadillas because they were both very good. I would definitely go back.",0
"I had a really great experience at Keen's! The service was top-notch and the decor was really classic and elegant. I really liked how old school it felt. The only downside was that the food wasn't as hot as I would've liked it to be, but the flavors were great regardless. My favorite dish was the prime rib, it was delicious. The Yukon mashed potatoes were also good. The desserts here are great, especially Eileen's cheesecake. It was so fluffy and light and still had a great flavor. Overall, Keen's is a great restaurant and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"The server Viet added more tip to my card than I put down, not sure if that was intentional (I gave about 19% tip originally so it wasn't like I under tipped).",0
"I had a really good time at Happy Eats! The atmosphere is really comfortable, and the staff is really friendly. The food is good, too. I particularly enjoyed my black beans and plantains. They were both really simple sides, but I thought they were really tasty. I also really liked the space - it's really broad and the lighting is really nice. Overall, I would definitely recommend Happy Eats to anyone looking for a good Cuban meal.",1
"Dim Sum Palace is a great place for dim sum. The barbecue pork, turnip cake, sticky rice, shrimp dumpling, and crab dumplings are all excellent. The soup dumplings are also very good. The only downside is that the temperature of some of the dishes was a bit off. Otherwise, the service was good, and the atmosphere was nice and casual. I would definitely come back.",1
"I've been to a few Sophie's locations and this one is not as good as others. The prices seem to increase with each visit and the portions definitely decrease. The Cuban or Pernil sandwich is the most notable size decrease- there's less and less filling and the bread itself is smaller and smaller. For the price you pay, it's an expensive sandwich. The Pernil is the meat to get at any Sophie's. It's moist and tender. The baked chicken is mediocre, on the dry side. The pork chop is also mediocre. The best sides are yucca, rice and beans and plantains. Always ALWAYS get loads of extra green sauce. You will need it to slather on everything. It's actually their best offering. The guava cheese empanada is a treat for sure!",1
Marta is a great place to go for a pizza in NYC. The staff is friendly and the happy hour is great. The pizzas are delicious and the desserts are to die for. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good pizza in the city.,1
I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and was really impressed. The price was great and the service was friendly. The food came out very quickly and it was all delicious. I especially loved the Pho - it was very hot and the soup was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.,1
"I had a decent slice at this restaurant and the toppings were in good variety. The slices were pretty clean, too. The staff was friendly, but I was turned away from the bathroom because I was with someone else. I don't know what kind of restaurant doesn't offer a restroom to its customers, but I guess that's their policy. The pizza was good, though.",1
"I absolutely love Jardino for their gluten free pizza! The crust is perfect, and the ingredients are always spot on. I've never had a bad experience here, and I always feel like I'm getting a great value. I wish they were open later in the night, but overall I really can't recommend this spot enough!",1
"This is an old time classic Chinese restaurant which I haven't been in years. We ordered plenty of dishes to celebrate the Year of the Tiger including: Cantonese crab, dumplings, fried pork chops, fried fish, noodles, fried chicken, squid and shrimp. Some dishes were better than others. I highly recommend the dumplings, shrimp and the beef chow fun. I would pass on the fried pork chops as they were a bit tough and not very seasoned. The service was great and I was happy to see that people were starting to come back to Chinatown. I would recommend Hop Kee for authentic Chinese food.",0
"I went to Virginia's for brunch with a pulsd deal. While the location is a bit out of the way, I was pleasantly surprised with how cute this quaint restaurant is and like how they decorated the walls with various menus. Service was friendly, the bellinis were quite large, and the food was all good enough to entice you to come back. My sister and I split the ricotta toast, burger and an order of fries.  The ricotta toast is simple but the fresh ricotta and honey pair beautifully. The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy and comes with a side of pickles. The fries are worth ordering as they're thin, crisp and served with a delicious aioli sauce. The dessert mint white chocolate mousse was good with an interesting flavor and the presentation was beautiful.",0
"The 4 stars is for the shrimp tostada which is $5. It's really spicy, there's plenty of shrimp, tomatoes, onions and cilantro. It even has some guacamole. I think I ate a really spicy jalapeño or Serrano pepper last night since I literally started tearing up and even though I was eating it with rice, I couldn't risk another bite in fear of consuming another pepper. But other than that... it's usually not as spicy and the flavors are quite refreshing. This is practically the only item I come here for. I did try a taco last night which was very greasy and almost resembled a small burrito. Again, I'm only giving the shrimp tostada 4 stars! Otherwise this might get a 3 star review. I don't think the 2 women working there are as rude as others have mentioned but we normally do a quick pick up so there isn't too much interaction with the staff.",0
"Okay Queen, I now get the Planta hype.When my coworkers told me they wanted to go to a 100% plant-based place for happy hour, I had my doubts. I am not vegan nor vegetarian... and I never really see myself becoming one. And yet, Planta has a special place in my heart.I've been here twice now and as a group we've tried almost everything on the menu. Drinks, ""sushi,"" appetizers, you name it. Everything is so good and each dish brings out a variety of flavors in its own unique way.Some of my favorites:Japanese sweet potato: with the spicy kimchi on top, it's so good!Bang bang broccoli: don't miss this.The sushi!!! I really love the ahi watermelon. The drinks - cocktails and mocktails were all solid.A special shout-out goes to Larry - our server and bartender who was absolutely fabulous in making recommendations and explaining everything to us. He made our night! Can't wait to be back again soon.",0
"I came here before a performance at the Lincoln center which is directly across the street.  I made a reservation through open table for 4:45pm and my table was ready when I got there.   The table was tiny, seat hard and nowhere to hang my coat.   I started with the burrata with roasted tomatoes salad.  It was very good.  I was in a vegetarian mood and my second course was a kale and quinoa salad with a vinaigrette.  It was okay, I added a little olive oil and it gave the salad a nice flavor.   The olive oil itself was delicious.  Service very good although the place was packed.   Very loud.",0
"We came here around noon on a Sunday and it was packed but we just had to wait 10mins to be seated.  This is a very dog-friendly restaurant and they give all the dogs water bowls. The menu was extensive and the portions were good. I got the Greek Omelette which came with salad and a bread basket. The Blueberry Pancakes were also delicious, much thicker than normal pancakes, but very filling and good. I would definitely come back to try more of their lunch dishes, the small plates and hummus looked amazing.",0
"Ichiran is the definitive Tonkotsu Ramen experience! The bowl is piping hot and maintains perfect ramen temperature, so every bite is delicious. The noodles are chewy and delicious and the broth is so flavorful. I love that you can choose the noodle texture and add toppings such as a soft boiled egg. I would definitely come back to Ichiran!",1
"I love visiting this restaurant! The service is always so friendly and welcoming, and the food is always delicious. The fries are my favourite thing, they're always so fresh and tasty. I also really enjoy their chicken wings - they're always cooked to perfection. The drinks menu is extensive and there's always something good on offer. The outdoor sitting area is open now and it's a great place to relax after dinner. Highly recommended!",1
"We had a great time at XO Taste! The food was great, and the service was even better. The dim sum was especially fantastic. The beef brisket soup noodles were a delicious and hearty dish, and the seafood congee was very tasty. The beef casserole was also really good - the perfect mix of savory and sweet. We'll definitely be back!",1
"I was excited to try this place out since I live nearby and I always see lots of people sitting outside for pandemic outside dining. I decided to order takeout / pickup through their website (online platform Cheqout). My main issue with this was the platform stated that they would text you when the order was ready for pick up, and although I received a confirmation that I placed an order, there was no text that the order was ready. I called the restaurant an hour later and they said my order was ready, but the pizza was beyond cold. I would suggest that they better integrate their online ordering or use a platform that gives you status updates on your order.What I liked about it was that you could order from both b side and ritas through the same platform and there was an option to basically remove anything (toppings, etc.) from the food if you have dietary restrictions. The pizza (Killer Bee) was pretty good after reheating, but there were a lot of really burnt pieces.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was okay but the service was really poor. I was really disappointed that the hostess was on her phone while we were eating our dinner and it just didn't feel very high-end. I don't think I'll be returning to Valbella anytime soon.",1
"I won't lie; after hearing Priyanka Chopra opened a new restaurant I was very curious to check it out. Overall I would say it was pretty good. I don't think it's a must go spot for Indian food but it's not terrible. The service however needs a lot of improvement. I highly recommend making a reservation in advance. When you first walk in the seating arrangements are kinda awkward if you're seated in the front of the restaurant. We had some issues with our server where she forgot our order twice and gave us an incorrect dessert as well. What made it worse was that the wait time to get her attention to tell her we were missing plates took forever. Definitely interrupted our dining experience. For appetizers we got the stuffed chicken wings, the grilled octopus and the grilled oysters. All of which were very good. My favorite of all three was probably the octopus. For main entrees we had the chicken tikka, lamb briyani and the fish curry. The biryani was too salty and the chicken tikka seemed to have the tomato flavor overpower the dish. However, the fish curry was really good but the best dish was jalebi dessert! I don't think I would go back but for others who are curious about a modern Indian menu, I would recommend. Unfortunately, I did videos of the dishes but Yelp won't let me upload so I just have screenshots of the videos for you guys ‍",0
"The Cavatelli was my favorite dish - it was so delicate and flavorful. The Calamari and clam chowder was also very good, and the chowder was very creamy. The only downside was that the calamari was a little dry. The cocktails were also great - I especially loved the Paloma and the tik toki. The service was also very good - they were very attentive and polite. Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The location was easy to find and the staff was friendly and helpful. The menu had a lot of variety to choose from, and I was able to create my own poke bowl. Prices were reasonable, and I would definitely come back.",1
"I was looking for a place to eat Indian food with outdoor seating and heating uptown and found this place. They have two semi enclosed ""cabins"" with an opening and a heating lamp overhead between them. The server was very accommodating when we switched to the side with more heat and it was warm enough to have dinner with coats on.

They have hand sanitizer and the server was wearing a mask. The samosa was excellent and very fresh, tasted like it was made today. The onion (kulcha) nan was also made today with fresh ingredients. And my mango lassi was very good. The chicken tikka Masala had grilled chicken cubes thrown into a just made creamy sauce. The one instance where I prefer it to be simmering for while, but with a pandemic fresh ingredients are de rigeur.

With so few options that met our aforementioned criteria, we were lucky to find this place. And also when I mentioned the 5% off for yelp check in, the waiter gave us 10% off this already reasonably priced upper East side restaurant. I asked and the waiter said they are doing a lot of take out and delivery during the pandemic.",1
"Went for an early dinner at 5p and found myself being the only customer and sitting next to a table of staff having their work dinner. Ha.Like what other reviews have pointed out, the skewers here though properly grilled were a bit underseasoned, a surprising letdown for a self-proclaimed northeastern style Chinese grill restaurant. I tried grilled eggplant, lamb, and pig trotters and found all of them a bit lacking in seasoning and flavor. The only dish I found relatively better seasoned was  Copper Pot Frogs . It was a bit of a rare find even in NYC and was the reason why I visited this place. The frogs came out in a traditional Chinese copper hot pot, nicely diced, sauteed, and packs a pleasant kick. I overheard from the restaurant people that the pickled pepper style frogs are even better. Wish I had asked for their recommendations!",0
"I visited this restaurant for restaurant week and was impressed with the service. The bartender was so friendly and helpful, and my wine was great. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there, so it was nice to have some privacy. The food came out quickly and I ordered the white bean soup and the pasta. I thought the soup was delicious and the pasta was also very good. My friend ordered the arugula salad and the roast chicken. I thought the chicken was delicious and my friend seemed to really enjoy it. Our waiter was very nice, and it took a while to get the check, but that was understandable given how busy the restaurant was. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I had a wonderful experience at Elite Restaurant! Our server, LK, was so friendly and helpful, and the food was great! The chopped cheese empanadas were a favorite, and the popcorn chicken was also delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu! The drinks are also amazing - they have these customized watermelons that are so cute!",1
"This little pub is near our hotel, so we decided to check it out. Even though it's near Times Square, it is really chilled. Hubby and I simply wanted apps and drinks. We opted for nachos with no meat and mozzarella sticks. I mean you really can't go wrong with nachos and cheese sticks. I got a glass of shiraz which was a tad overpriced, but I understand it's all about location. Our server was attentive but not pushy. My water glass stayed filled.The food was simply a 3, but the service and cleanliness of the place made it a 4.",0
"Finally made it out for dinner at the lovely Lola taverna. Can we firstly get into how beautiful the decor is. The flowers the lights ! I literally felt transported to some island paradise. Got a table for one because well you guys know that's how I roll I don't like share my apps'. Got the chicken gyro bao buns and the moussaka. The bao buns were so delicious . The actual buns pillow soft with a hint of sweetness and the chicken perfectly cooked and seasoned. The moussaka is a definite must have , delicious and filling and that bechamel sauce is so silky smooth and delicious. Fair warning it is quite dense so you won't be able to finish it. 4 stars because even though the moussaka was good it was a bit salty for me. Definitely a must visit and I will be back to try their other items. Maybe with a friend as long as they don't touch my apps",0
"I had heard great things about the burger here but was very underwhelmed. I ordered the burger ($15) with fries ($4) and the boneless chicken wings ($12).First off, we placed an order for pickup and preordered about 30 minutes later, and it was ice cold when we got it. I'm convinced they made it the second it came through.Despite being cold, the fries were good and a solid portion for the price paid. The burger was phenomenal but was about 3x as much as it should be. Like, it tasted like shake shack. I would have liked it a lot had I paid $7 for it, but for $15....hard pass.The Buffalo boneless chicken wings were horrendous. You know the chicken you get from the Chinese restaurants that are rated like 1 star on Yelp? Imagine that in the worse Buffalo sauce you've ever had dipped in watered down ranch and you've got it. Waste of $12.All in all, I'm a hard pass on the food. Save your money and go to shake shack.",0
"Felice 64 is a reliable Italian restaurant with a classic menu and a cosy interior. The food was good, with my favorite dish being the Arancini balls. The service was decent, not overly attentive. Courses were brought in a timely fashion. Overall, I had a good experience at Felice 64.",1
I wish they opened up more of these restaurants outside of NYC because I have been craving this food since I got it! The menu is overwhelming with options and each meal is packed with flavor and spice. Asian food with a modern flair. Wish the Firecracker Chicken had more chicken in it but the quantity of everything else was great. Service was on the slower side but not bad at all,0
"I think this place is as good as any other bar nearby, but is more of a staple in the local community. They've got Tuesday night karaoke, but the bar is generally very dark after 9:30 (probably to encourage more romantic activities?).The food seemed okay although we were only able to comment on the breakfast burger. Burger was cooked medium well, it was hot and juicy and nice poached egg on top with the English muffin looked like it worked well.Service was A+, but would be great if they had a drink menu, or at least could update the board with beers available. Would be great if they had some actually interesting drinks like every other bar in Manhattan, and would be cool if they stocked up on craft beer. Provide a good reason for coming here, and people will come, IMO",0
"We stopped by this restaurant while walking around China Town and were immediately drawn in by the beautiful outdoor seating. The soup dumplings were our first order and we were not disappointed. The pork and crab soup dumplings were both delicious, but the shrimp shu mai were our favorite. The pork buns were also very good, but the duck spring rolls were our favorite. We can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!",1
"I absolutely love Joe's Pizzeria! The pizza is delicious and is definitely one of the best things to eat in New York City. I especially love the Supreme pizza, which is a mixture of meat and vegetables. The service is not the best here, but it is still fast and efficient. The only downside is that it can be quite busy, so be sure to arrive early if you want to get a seat.",1
"Variety of vegetarian options on the menu: 4/5Dropped by this spot while on a work trip to New York; there are several around the city and heard from my friends that it was a favorite for quality food and a quick bite. I really enjoyed the market plate and felt that all the vegetables were fresh and well seasoned! However, I wasn't too impressed with the veggie hot dog. It was definitely frozen and maybe I was expecting something house made or maybe Impossible ""meat."" However none of the food was bad! Check this place out if you're in need of a quick bite or just can't figure out where to eat when with a group of friends.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The wait wasn't too long, and the food was really good. I especially loved the salmon and beef bulgogi. The drink was also really good and refreshing. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick and easy meal.",1
"Maison Kayser is a great place to visit for coffee and pastries. I especially like the bright and cute atmosphere in the back, as well as the free refills on coffee. The portions are small for the price, but the quality of food is high. The service is great and they take their duties seriously. I just wish the prices were lower or the portions were bigger.",1
"Overpriced Expensive Ramen. Very little noodles, one piece of pork charsui, and a ball of spicy ground pork. Unfortunately there are very few ramen spots in midtown and this is where my friend and I wound up. I ended up getting the Karaka Spicy (pork). While the soup was very delicious the lack of soup and the quantity was very upsetting.Totto Ramen all the way.",0
"We enjoyed our quick lunch at Los Tacos No. 1 near Times Square. It was really cold and windy so it was nice to have a moment out of the wind. Once you place your order and pay they give you a ticket. You move down the line and hand the ticket to a person behind the counter. You'll be asked if you want flour or corn tortillas and if you want them the way they come (onions, salsa, cilantro, guacamole). The guacamole is more of a guac sauce than actual guacamole. Very delicious. We also ordered the chips and guacamole. It's about a 1/4-1/2 cup of guacamole, the chips were really good. Not too thin, they hold up when you dip the guacamole and that is what I want in a chip;). There is a sauce bar where you can find pico and assorted sauces. I didn't get a picture of those but you'll see them in other reviews. I didn't add sauce to my taco because I wanted to taste the flavors as they are originally in the taco. I had the Jamaican tea and it was good, I didn't really want a soda or water so it hit the spot. Not too sweet but had a good flavor, slightly fruity flavor. We each ordered tacos and I have to say the chicken taco was full of flavor. You can tell that they didn't just cook chicken and add spices. It takes time for the flavors in that chicken to fully incorporate. One of the best tacos I have had. It's standing room only, I sent my family over to watch for a spot while I ordered for us #divideandconquer and that worked out alright. I wish we had tried the Chelsea Market location because there are tables there since it has more of a food hall situation going on....nonetheless it was a delicious quick lunch  and I'm glad we were able to give it a try!",0
"The restaurant was small and crowded, with no one checking if I had a vaccination card. The pizza I got was okay, but it was a little too wet and soggy for my liking. The service was friendly and fast, though. Overall, I wasn't impressed, but I would come back if I was in the area.",1
"This place isn't much too look at, but it's got some yummy frozen drinks and some goodddddd food. I've been here a lot of times. The wings are my favorite!! The sauces i always get on The side because i can never choose which I want! The chicken and waffles is also very good. Love this place!",0
"Thursday Kitchen is a restaurant that I would not recommend. The glowing LED light cube CAPRI-THURSDAY clear pouch drinks are the main attraction, but the experience was not good. The waitress was very rude and intrusive, and the food was not good either. The steak was not tender enough, the soft shell crab was over-fried, the kimchi paella was too dry, and the popcorn ice cream was the only memorable dish.",1
"I think if you have fairly high standards for Asian cuisine, this place is average. Atmosphere and service is wonderful, and the review is more for their dishes. We got the chicken skewers, Ba Mee Poo Moo Dang, and Duck Salad. Chicken was extremely dry and small, contrary to places where portions were decent sized, juicy chunks. The dishes were actually very nice flavor wise, but not within the top Duck salads I've had. Since I've never had Ba Mee noodles before, I have no relative standards, but I would get this dish if I were to come again. In addition, portion size is small compared to other places of comparable prices. It's not a restaurant I would discourage anyone from going to, but just simply not a priority on my re-visit.",0
"The wings at Buffalo wild wings - great! Service - not so great. It's been a while since I visited this location, but I decided to stop by for lunch since I was in the area. I got seated pretty quickly as it was pretty early, and I was able to order soon after. I went with the lunch special wing combo - got half Asian zing and half bourbon honey mustard with some fries. When I received my wings, they did not automatically come with the celery and carrots + ranch dipping sauces at all. I had tried multiple times to flag down the waiter and ask for my missing sauce and water. And it was on my second request that I finally received what I had asked for. In the end they also charged me for ordering extra ranch when it was usually provided with wings! The waiters were quite hard to get when they were busy. The wings were great, but due to the mediocre and slow service, I will most likely not be returning to this location.",0
"I absolutely love Dyckman sushi! The atmosphere is so inviting and the staff are so professional. The only downside is that it can often be quite difficult to get a table, but it's definitely worth the wait. The food is absolutely delicious and I can't recommend it enough!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ambience is gorgeous and the service was attentive. I ordered the Pao de Queijo as part of the Yelp special and they were cheesy puff balls, nice crisp on the outside, with melted cheese on the inside. For my main, I ordered the mussels which was also good. I loved the sauce and the side of bread it came with. The mussels were cooked perfectly and the side of garlic mashed potatoes was also delicious. I would definitely come back here!",1
"I was really excited to come to this restaurant, but I was a bit disappointed. My reservation was at 4 on a Sunday afternoon, and I didn't eat until close to 6. I do like the brunches, but they're two course. It is a very fun party, but the girl at the table next to me, her breast popped out. The establishment gets an extra star for that. At $15 individual drinks are expensive. Wear your Sundays best, the clientele go all out in the fashion department.",1
"I decided to run out and get a quick bite and Le Sia had recently opened. I went in and was seated immediately. They had been doing some work on the front door and I thought they were closed but they stepped aside and I walked in. The menu is a little confusing and I was encouraged to try the skewers, which turned out to be very tasty. I started with the tiger shrimp [2] with a piece of pineapple in between drizzled with a white sauce. The shrimps are small but tasty. I moved onto the Red willow lamb skewer and then tried the chicken, the shrimp [ a large shrimp on a skewer with the shell-no way to eat this except to peel by hand-messy!!!] The squid was good as well but 4 small pieces. A normal sized person with an appetite would need to have at least 10-15 skewers to feel full. It is just not enough food. The food was good and the skewers are not overpriced but....the staff was helpful in explaining the menu and making suggestions. I will make a return visit in a few weeks to try something which may be more substantial.",0
I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food was mediocre at best and the prices were pretty high. The octopus tostada was the only good thing about it.,1
"Overall experience solid 4! Food wise it's a 3 BUT happy hour was awesome. So they get an extra star, it's everyday from 4-7pm and has drinks/apps etc. we got there just in time Friday with a 6:45pm resi! Our waiter was a gem and let us quickly order a bunch of HH items! We each got margs, queso fundido, tostada de ceviche (just ok), and nachos. The nachos were the best thing we ordered to be honest- so good! We then ordered tacos, alambre (steak), Pescado (fish) and Pancita al pastor (pork belly -very fatty) and sadly we weren't impressed with the tacos. 2 come per order and they are good to share but they were just OK. I also felt everything was soggy but that's because of the tortilla they use- although it did taste authentic and home made. Would hit up the happy hour again but that's likely it...",0
"Honest review. You legit come here for the experience and nothing else. Seinfeld made this spot famous and that's it's. But it's nothing like the one on TV. Beware it's super tiny. You may have to wait. Some staff is nice and some is east coast attitude so what can you do. Coffee and food is aight, nothing spectacular. But I will give them this, the food was ready fast. I'd jus come to get pics and a quick glance but totally up to you. Happy new year!",0
I don't know. It was ok. This is going to sound a little odd but the vibe was off in here and I attribute that to bad lighting. Yep. I said that. I don't mean to be too rough on these guys but it was too bright in here. Comfortable enough. Very nice bartender but I only stayed for one drink and then left. Just did not hold my interest.,1
"I had a great time at this izakaya! The food was delicious and there was a good variety of options to choose from. I especially loved the yakitori, which was served with a variety of dipping sauces. The only downside was that the restaurant was very smoky, which made it a little difficult to breathe. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I stopped by Pho 99 for a quick bowl of pho around 4pm. They had a table available, so my girlfriend and I went in. We received small complimentary cups of tea, then glasses of pinot grigio, served chilled. I tried both the L3 Pho w/ medium-cooked steak and the grilled pork banh mi. The sandwich was light and crispy: tender tasty strips of pork, cucumber, jalapenos, cilantro, shredded carrots, in a nice baguette. The mayo was light and added lubrication for chewing through each delicious bite. The pho was fine. Not the richest broth, but light, simple. The bean sprouts and basil on the side were quite fresh, and the cilantro and jalapeno slices provided flavor. The steak was also fresh, making for an adequate, albeit restrained, bowl of noodle soup. I will commend the excellent service and note that proper hygiene and sanitation procedures are in place. Also, the pho is super cheap; most bowls are under $10, which is very competitive.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The vegetarian dim sum was definitely a highlight for me - there were so many different options to choose from, and they all tasted great. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're looking for a good vegetarian meal.",1
"We had a great time at Catch NYC! Our favorite dish was the Truffle Sashimi, it was delicious with a delicious sauce. The other dishes we ordered were also really good. The lighting of the restaurant is a bit hard on the eyes, but otherwise everything was great! We would definitely come back and recommend Catch NYC to others.",1
I was excited to try this place out. It had great views and a nice ambiance. However the customer service was disgustingly bad that I had to leave before I even ordered my food. Maybe they only served people that looked like they were made of money but I personally don't recommend due to poor customer service.,0
"I used to love sushi here, but now the portions are so small I can't even finish one. And the avocado in my salmon avocado roll was literally the size of a pea. The other disappointing part was that they discontinued the truffle oil avocado. It was one of the highlights of the dish. Overall, I'm very disappointed and I won't be coming back.",1
"There was a mixup with our reservation last night, but thankfully they were still able to accommodate us in their outdoor street-eatery. It's worth noting that tables both inside and outside are quite close to one another - but that's New York!Nothing on the regular on the menu was more than $16! Things on the specials board didn't have prices; the Gnocchi Tartufo ended up being $24 but the creamy truffle sauce was delicious! My husband's Orecchiette with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe was also very good. Portion sizes are decent - we could've had a starter and / or dessert as well, but we were headed to an event with more food afterwards.",0
"They don't make pizza like this where I'm from (California) or where I've been living (Michigan). I have to admit, every pizza place in nyc makes awesome pizza! So maybe I'm not used to the amazing thing that is ny pizza, but I would come back here again and again. Great customer service too. Just thought at $4 for a veggie slice, it was a bit steep.",0
"Raku is absolutely one of my top restaurant choices in NYC. Their South Village location has more seating, indoor and outdoor and you can also make reservations at this location. Our go to's are the niku udon, ebiten udon, and pressed mackerel. but have also tried others! (Those are the best imo) -Niku udon: very rich and delicious beef broth. Comes with big pieces of short rib and tripe. I'm not a huge fan of tripe, but just end up leaving it or giving to someone if they want it. - Ebiten udon: flavorful/clean broth and comes with 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 veg tempura. - Pressed mackerel: they have now changed it to 7 pieces of pressed mackerel (used to be 3). Smoky mackerel flavor and a littttle bit too much rice but it's fine! I'd still order it every timeWe've also had their gyoza and chicken kaarage apps that are just as delicious. My boyfriend recently tried the clam udon, which was reallly good but $$$. There's more of a seafood flavor to the broth, but it's cut with butter and pepper too! All udon bowls come with a good amount of perfect texture noodles. You'll definitely leave FULL. Raku never disppoints!",0
"Duck jianbing. 4/5. We got takeout, so the crepe got a little more moist than ideal but it was rather tasty! Loved the fresh cucumbers inside the softened crepe, along with the duck. Pretty darn tasty, even after it had been sitting in the bag, waiting for us. There are 2 small tables with 2 stools each just outside the store where you can eat your food during these covid times.",0
"We came by Tuesday night for dinner and there was no wait! It was relatively busy, but wasn't too loud and service was nice and attentive. I'm giving this three stars because I feel that the food wasn't as flavorful as it could've been. We asked for super spicy tofu soup and it was pretty mild imo. On the other hand, my bean curd soup was really spicy! Maybe they got our orders messed up, but still I felt that the taste or Korean food kick wasn't there. Service: 5/5 The waitress was really attentive and super sweet!!",0
"A lovely, bright little cafe in SoHo. The Greek focus is a welcome respite from the endless grain bowl places; this means spanikopita and moussaka, baklava and galaktoboureko rivaling the best Astoria has to offer (and that's no coincidence, the owner also owns the fantastic Artopolis bakery). Don't skip the coffee.",0
"The chips and guac were pretty good, but the tacos were lackluster. The steak, chicken, and carnitas were dry and lacked flavor. The tortillas were homemade and weren't good, and the rice on the tacos was a strange addition. The restaurant didn't have any booze, which made the experience even worse. We won't be back.",1
"We pass by this place quite often and always tell ourselves we should try it out because it looks nice! We finally went on a Monday and it didn't disappoint! It's Italian food with an Asian influence. We got the boba tea drinks to start -- lychee with black tea and mango with green tea. Both were delicious and refreshing, a hint of alcohol taste but not overpowering.For small plates we got the tuna crostini and cauliflower. Our waiter told us the small plates go from small to large on the menu which was very helpful and the cauliflower was definitely a good portion. For the main course we went with the chicken parm. The sauce for the cauliflower was absolutely delicious, had a little spice though FYI. The chicken parm was delicious. We were able to split everything and still had some cauliflower and chicken parm left over. Our waiter was also extremely helpful with picking items and checked in often which was great.We really enjoyed our meal and experience and will likely come back to try more options.",0
I absolutely loved this restaurant! The atmosphere was so cozy and the views of the city were amazing. The service was great and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the Burrata salad and the IPA was also great. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!,1
"The EAK ramen is a great option if you're looking for a hearty and tasty bowl of ramen. The broth and noodles were both delicious and the thick noodles were cooked perfectly. The only downside is that there wasn't much toppings included, which could easily be remedied with an additional $1-$2. For $15, this is a great deal, but I would recommend adding some extra toppings to make it more complete.",1
"Love the design of this restaurant with industrial chandeliers that hang from vaulted ceiling. The cool guitar shaped ceiling over the bar caught my eyes. So I really wanted to give this restaurant 4 stars but unfortunately couldn't for two reasons 1) the food is incredible but portion and value is just not there 2) aerialist performances on a Saturday is apparently not a guarantee although they advertise it pretty hard. Recommendation to the restaurant, please make the portion size a little bigger so customers can justify the price...a bite size tostada appetizer should not cost $9.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The service was prompt and the food was delicious. I ordered the shoyu ramen and the spicy vegetable ramen. Both of them were really good. The pork in the shoyu ramen was really tender and melted in my mouth. The noodles were also really good. However, I did get food poisoning after eating here, so I would not recommend this place if you are not careful about food poisoning.",1
"I was disappointed with my visit to Downtown Arepa. The empanada was bland and the short rib AREPA was dry and tough. However, the service was very nice. The restaurant was quite empty when I visited, so I'm hopeful that my next visit will be more successful. I'll give it a third star for now, but I'm not sure if I'll continue visiting. In addition, Downtown Arepa donates food to children in need in Latin America, which is a nice touch.",1
"I've only been to BCD a couple times in my life, but neither visit really impressed. Sure, their banchan was plentiful and, in taste, definitely was a smidge above average. This time around, we had kimchi, marinated garlic stems, pickles, potato salad and spicy dried squid. My favorites were the potato salad and spicy dried squid. The potato salad had a touch of sweetness, thanks to the addition of raisins in the mix and was mayonnaise-y without being heavy. The spicy dried squid was perfectly chewy and thoroughly permeated with the fragrance and kick of Korean gochugaru. I'm also a fan of the fried mackerel that comes with every entree. The entire fish is deep-fried to a crisp which means the whole thing is edible--bones and all! My soondubu, however, was not so impressive. I went with the Doenjang, which should be a classic flavor, considering soybean paste is the base of all their tofu soups. However, my soondubu was just plain salty and excessively so. If it were not for the comfort of having something hot to drink on a wintry day, I would not have finished my bowl! The table also went with an order of topokki to share. The topokki sauce had a decent amount of heat and was appropriately viscous, but there simply wasn't enough rice cake! There was a little more than a handful of pieces, certainly not enough for our table of 6 to share, and only two pieces of fish cake. If you go for this app, I'd recommend it be split between two or three people at most. I hear that BCD is a favorite of many, but I am wary of returning to this chain. I am sure there are plenty of other Korean establishments that can offer better quality dishes at this price point.",0
"Stopped in for a quick bite in Chelsea market before heading to the Mickey Mouse exhibit down the street. I got the standard burger and fries, and it cost over $17. Perhaps a bit excessive for a non-table-service place, but I've paid more for less. The burger was good. Well-seasoned, well-cooked, and had some good toppings on it. The fries were great. Also, they offer a good selection of sodas, including a delicious blueberry soda my diet would not have let me have more of.Nothing life-changing, but a solid burger and very good fries.",0
"The food is good. They offer outdoor seating. It's a busy place on weekend. I tried to most famous pho, I think it's a bit too oily. I didn't finish the soup. The coconut is good and fresh, but expensive too. It gets busy so they will ask you to leave once you finish the food and pay. Good for a quick bite.",0
"I came here for afternoon tea and was generally unimpressed. The surroundings are cute but the experience was generally unremarkable. First of all, they didn't even provide a menu after we sat down. I get that the afternoon tea is a standardized service, but it would have been nice to know how much it cost to add a glass of wine, what sandwiches to expect, etc. When I requested that my sandwiches be all vegetarian, the server didn't seem thrilled, but ultimately was able to provide egg salad sandwiches, goat cheese tomato tarts, and open face cucumber chive butter sandwiches. All the sandwiches were good. The scones were warm and fresh but not that great: sort of doughy, rather than being crumbly. The other sweets were pretty forgettable. Finally, the tea selection was nothing to get excited about. I think it was all Harney & Sons, but they went out of their way to pick the most boring teas possible (English breakfast, chamomile, etc.) The only non-basic tea option was the Paris (flavored black tea) which was actually excellent.",0
"Do not recommend this establishment. I came inside in my work clothes and looking online it says that it's open. However, when I went in (at 11:35pm) the male host says they close in 20 minutes. Thinking about it I'm like ""alright well is the kitchen open, he said no"" I called just now at (11:37pm) and whoever answered the phone- it would be hilariously ironic if it was the same host - just said they closed at 2 am. Now... is the kitchen really closed or what? Even so, what if I came for drinks and wanted to blow some steam off. It kind of broke my spirits I won't lie. I didn't expect this in NYC of all places, but anything is possible. I won't say this establishment is racist, but damn sure the people they hire- MALE HOST- are sketchy af. and not a good look. And by the looks of another review this isn't their first instance   where a staff member at this place was being ignorant.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying out this new restaurant in my neighborhood, but unfortunately their entrance is still not accessible as there is still a sizeable step that a wheelchair cannot pass. This is a huge barrier for people with disabilities, and it's really unfortunate that they haven't updated their entrance accordingly.",1
Not impressed. Margaritas were pre made....the shrimp was swimming in a pool of unpleasant oil...meh I'd skip this place,0
Great flavor. Reasonable price. Friendly staff. Always love to come to this pizza place.,0
"Really tasty, delicious chinese divvy ramen shop that I like to go to when I am in midtown.  I highly recommend the coconut curry broth, it is tasty and creamy.  I think the pricing is moderate and the service is good.  The restaurant could use some sprucing up.",0
"Super fun michelin spot turning out British goodies on a high end scale - I will say - BEST COCKTAILS I HAVE HAVE EVER HAD- Leo our server was also awesome, they never judged when we asked for more bread butter even the black salt on our cocktail ! The beef Wellington is a must as it's so time consuming and nice to have it prepared right ! Fish and chips were nice but not necessarily mind blowing - the salad was DELICIOUS! And malted chocolate ice cream was a lovely treat - interior is stunning and just so fun !",0
"At first glance, this place reminded me of many local spots my father used to take us to in Chinatown in the 80's. The lighting is sparse, tables close together, seating tight but for 5 of us on a Friday night, this place was perfect. While I tend not to get into specifics of the food (my opinion is that everyone's palate's are different, what I deem excellent could be equally disgusting to someone else), I will say that most of the dishes we ordered had some tinge of spice to it (we had my 7 year old, who is ""sensitive"" to spice - not really;) so were pretty conscious of the spice factor; although I didn't find any dish overly spicy. Regardless, staples like pad thai, orange tofu, and the like were delicious, you wouldn't know this was a vegan restaurant if you didn't ask. Seriously. I'd like to say we'll be back but with so many great vegan restaurants to check out, it might take us some time. I would most definitely recommend this place!",0
"In short: wasn't impressed with the tapas, but the arroz negro paella was amazing. The tapas are overpriced, especially considering they're all going to be tiny portions (to be expected of tapas) and they were average tasting. The best tapas dish was the gambas al ajillo (shrimp in sizzling hot oil with garlic); it was full of delicious garlic flavor! The others (chorizo, tortilla espanola, patatas bravas, croquetas) were good, but I've had better and cheaper. As for the paella, it's expensive, but they are extremely generous with the seafood portions! Every paella is FULL of meat/seafood. In particular, the scallops are super buttery! The arroz negro was my favorite; the rice is black from squid ink, and it was saucier than the others that we tried (socarrat, pescado y marisco, langosta). We had a large party, so we made a reservation beforehand; definitely a must-do since this place is pretty cramped.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The crudo tasting was really good and there was a lot of variety in it. I would definitely recommend it. The spaghetti alla chitarra was also really good, and I liked the lemon balm/saffron combo in the dressing. The summer lettuces salad was also great, and the service was great.",1
I stopped here today for the beef noodle soup..nothing special and didn't include a lot of meat in it..a little Mala but I wouldn't return,0
"This place is amazing! We tried some of the most popular items on the m eh based off of several of hundred of reviews and we were not disappointed. The dumplings seem to all be amazing but the pork and chives was by far the best!! Excellent flavor combination. The duck pancake was also delicious and very light! The boiled wontons in the spicy sauce was my wife's favorite, as it had a nice kick to it. They have a lot of options on the menu but definitely go for the dumplings",0
"I absolutely loved Chow House! The food was amazing and the service was great. I came here with my boyfriend after watching a show at the Comedy Cellar and we were not disappointed. First, don't forget to check-in (via Yelp) to get your free glass of wine! For appetizers, we split the Dan Dan Noodles which was so good. We were hungry and devoured this within seconds. For entrees, we ordered the Chili Fish and Sautéed Snow Pea Shoots with Garlic. The chili fish was slightly on the sweeter-side, but definitely had a nice kick with spice and was really good. Was a little surprised by the sweetness of it, so I probably wouldn't re-order, but it still was really good and I'm glad we were able to try it. The sautéed snow pea shoots was heavenly - the vegetables were so buttery and tasty. This was gone with seconds.

I would definitely recommend Chow House to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I had a really good time at this restaurant! The wait was only about 30 minutes on the weekends, and the space was a bit cramped but that didn't stop us from being able to enjoy ourselves. The Jane burger was really delicious and I really loved the rosemary fries - they were a great addition to the meal. The salad was definitely a bit lacking in flavor, but I didn't really care because everything else about the meal was so good. The service was also pretty good, though I didn't leave my phone number with them in case I needed to be contacted about my table. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to friends and would definitely come back myself.",1
"Everything was smooth for us start to finish on a recent visit. I appreciated their adherence to covid guidelines (unlike some other places) and it was very easy getting checked in and seated in a timely manner. The restaurant itself is lovely and there are so many enticing options in the menu. We had a pretty decent variety and enjoyed all of it. My favorite was the catfish waffles. And the mac and cheese, as well as the greens, got thumbs up from a particularly picky soul food critic in our group. The service was great and I would absolutely go again.",0
"Got the green double ($15) here and it was delicious! Loved having some greens, the vegan cheese was amazing & even my meat-eating friend had a bite and said it was it was incredible. Service was fast (I went around 8:30pm on a Saturday night) & prices are pretty reasonable. The only thing I would note is the portions were a little smaller than I was expecting. I had been snacking and wasn't that hungry but still managed to finish the double. There also wasn't much variety to the menu (usually 2 main burger options and 1 rotating special) & ingredients.Yay for more vegan burger places in nyc!",0
"We had a great experience at this restaurant! The service was prompt and polite, and the food was perfect. I especially loved the catfish waffles and the mac and cheese. My friend was really pleased with the variety of options in the menu, and all of us agreed that the greens were delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Delmonico's is a great restaurant that I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting New York City. The service was great and the food was delicious. The only downside was the noise level, which was a bit deafening. However, I think that this is a minor issue overall and definitely worth visiting if you're ever in the area.",1
"We stopped in here for a quick lunch and I'm really glad we did. The menu is straightforward and there are plenty of options to choose from, including a Harlem Classic burger which I ordered. The burger was delicious - the patties were pounded thin and had a great crust on them. The toppings were on the bottom bun, so the sauce, onions, and pickles were all well-distributed. The cheese was melted perfectly between the two patties. The chicken was also very well-seasoned and crispy. I thought the sandwich was a little overpriced for what it was, but I'd definitely recommend it. The fries were standard fare - nothing outstanding, but definitely tasty. Overall, a great lunch spot that I'll be back to!",1
"The shrimp tostada is my favorite item here, and it's definitely worth the $5. The shrimp is spicy but not too spicy, and the tomatoes, onions, and cilantro are all fresh and delicious. The guacamole is a nice touch, and the rice is always cooked well. I don't think the staff is as rude as some others have said, but they're not particularly friendly, either. Overall, this is a great restaurant with good food at reasonable prices.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ambiance and decor are really cute and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I got the hanger steak, phnom penh fried chicken, and egg noodles. The chicken was good and crispy and was topped with the pickled chilis. The chilis were so good we asked for a side of it. The egg noodles was the star of the show! We wanted to eat it with our steak but our steak took pretty long to come out. However, the steak comes with a pho dry rub to dip with-- pretty cool idea! For drinks I got the Pride of the Peacock cocktail and it was SO GOOD! I haven't had a drink as good as that in a while. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Overall, we had a fun time at this restaurant. The wait can be a bit long, but it's worth it for the fun atmosphere. The interior is small and a little tight, but with good kpop music playing. The only downside is that the drinks are a bit expensive. However, the watermelon soju was a nice touch. Overall, I would recommend this place for a casual night out with friends.",1
"I wasn't completely blown away by the food here, but it was certainly very satisfactory and very affordable for midtown. I work a block away, but only visited for the first time on Saturday... Seems like I've been missing out on the awesome lunch specials! I feel like I don't eat Indian enough to judge the authenticity of the food, but I'd consider it that.

Around 5pm, our party of 3 was seated immediately. Cozy vibes. Definitely got busier (and darker) by the time we left, with a few people waiting for tables. We got the free basket of naan (courtesy of yelp check-in) which paired well with the Chicken Korma ($16). The chicken korma tasted like standard curry to me ... whatever that means lol. Maybe we should've gotten it a tad spicier, but it was a good, typical comfort dish.

You bet we ordered the garlic naan ($3.50) as well -- it is of course the go-to, must-order. Did not disappoint! And I might have burned my tongue a bit from the vegetable samosa ($3) but it was worth it. Would like to try the lamb/pe",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent but the service was slow. The espresso martini was good, and the loaded fries were just kind of dry. I would come back for a quick snack but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a full meal.",1
I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The food was bland and unappetizing. I would not recommend it to anyone.,1
"As our children get older its harder to captivate to go on ""family"" trips.Luckily NYC is a good one!! We decided that every Monday of the summer months we gonas a family to different places.Today it's NYC .....after a fun day we were hungry and popped in Bubba Gumps. The wait was about 30ish mins which gave us time to pop on over the M&M store while we waited.We came back at the time estimated for us and we were sat immediately. The staff was friendly. We were a party of 6 including a child. We decided to skip the appetizer and go straight to the meals. What I love is the sign they have in the middle of the table! If you need a server to stop you flip the sign and it WORKS! Our entrees were strawberry salad entree, grilled seafood trio dish with mashed potatoes,  kids chicken finger meal, 20 for $22 ( which is shrimp tempura and fried shrimp)with mashed, shrimpers heaven, and a cheeseburger.The food was excellent! All my children enjoyed it. My husband too. The little one was excited because jello was included in her meal!The one thing I wished they  would do that I experienced in the past was the Forrest Gump trivia.  That had made my trip memorable years ago.The server we had was funny and personable. The manager was attentive and nice as well. I definitely recommend you try this restaurant out, it has nice souvenir store as well.",0
"I wanted a couple slices and didn't want  to spend a bunch of time at it, so I found this place near my Airbnb.  Good pizza! They had a two slices and a coke for $5.50 deal,  which was a great price. I left full and happy.",0
"I had a great time at Loulou Petit Bistro! The outdoor seating is so cute and SF could learn a few things from NY's outdoor dining. The Burrata was good, but the star of the night was the Baked Camembert. It was so decadent and creamy- one of my favorites of the night. The Dozen Oysters were also really fresh. The Fries were nicely crispy. The Brussels Sprouts were another favorite, so crispy and so much flavor. Two of our friends got the The World is Yours drink and enjoyed it. They were very pretty. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely come back when in NYC.",1
I absolutely loved the chicken sandwich I ordered from this restaurant! The staff were super friendly and the food came quickly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.,1
"I've never been here because it seemed very touristy but the food was pretty good. The servers were absolute darlings and so friendly. They joked with us a lot and I had so much fun there. I got the pernil asado because I've had it once before and I knew I was going to like it but I did not expect the mouthwatering dish that would appear in front of me. One bite and I was sold -- I am coming here again, I thought to myself. I have to get other people to try this. The portions were HUGE. I thought that $18+ was expensive for an entree but the portions reflect that amount. I also thought it seemed small and unimpressive; but as I worked my way through the dish, I found that I just couldn't finish it. The pernil was so rich and melted in my mouth. The rice that came with it-- my god I don't know what they did to it, probably soaked it in some pork fat but it was SO good. Some cons: they actually forgot a few of what we ordered, but as soon as we flagged down a server they promptly brought it out to us in the next five minutes. Probably because we had ordered a lot of things. Another con is that I thought the chicharron was very dry. Don't get that. Ropa vieja was ok but I was never a fan of it because I thought it was really dry as well. The chips and guac seemed small, I was pretty disappointed when I saw it. Otherwise I would one hundred percent come here again, but only when I'm starving! I know they will handle it. Get the pernil and the appetizer samplers.",0
"Came here for indoor dining before that was not available anymore. This restaurant likes to give freebies (tapas, sangria, and/or dessert) to regulars.     I felt very comfortable dining indoors, because the staff took all the precautions and all the tables were more than 6 feet apart or had a huge screen partition. It's too bad the city closed indoor dining again. I continue to order delivery from them. Will brave the outdoor dining during winter eventually.",0
"I would give them zero stars if I could. The servers are so incredibly rude. We made a reservation/waitlist on yelp (which they suggest to ""save time"") but when we got there they didn't care. My friend had given me her order because she went to their other location and we were trying to get food before a show but the rude guy at the desk would not seat me despite me being ready to place BOTH orders. Good food is always something to look for but when the service is this rude it's not even worth waiting for food.",0
"Alright now - it's been awhile since the last time I've been WOWed by pizza. I don't remember the last time. I feel like the last time was few years ago at a spot in Brooklyn but honestly rubirosa was better!The crust/dough. Ugh. Perfect. It's thin and has a nice crisp to it. The sauce was AMAZING. Best tomato sauce I've had on a pizza. I don't like it when tomato sauce is too acidic. This one was incredibly balanced, with a burst of that good, tomatoey sweetness it was amazing. The sauce to crust ratio was perfect as well.We got half tie dye and half honey pie. I loved both. We got a large which was more than enough for two people (had 3 slices leftover). We also ordered the arugula salad which was refreshing.Highly recommend. If you come earlier around 5:30 you can probably snag bar seats.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The hot pot was especially delicious - it was piping hot and instantly warmed us up. The size was also huge, which was great. My husband had the scallop option from the right immortals meal and it was lovely - he can't consume refined sugar due to health reasons and the options here are mostly without sugar, which is rare for Asian food. It felt like clean eating and felt rejuvenated. The ambiance was also relaxing and the restaurant was very clean, which added to the pleasant atmosphere. The owner was passionate about healthy eating and checked on us during the meal, which was lovely. We highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"This place had a lot of potential, but in the end it just didn't live up to it. The sushi chefs behind the counter looked tired and the lighting was poor, which made the atmosphere a bit off-putting. The service was friendly and helpful, but it couldn't make up for the lackluster food. I had an average shrimp tempura appetizer and Japanese style steak (which was supposed to be the best steak I've ever had), but both of them were disappointing. The shrimp came out soggy and the steak lacked flavor. Unfortunately, this was really close to my hotel, so I should have heeded the average reviews on Yelp and gone somewhere else.",1
"I visited this pizza place today and it was pricier than I would've liked, but I guess that's to be expected in NYC. The pizza was tasty though and the crust was really thin which I enjoyed. The only downside is that it was a bit of a wait for a party of two.",1
"Came here for the 3 course Restaurant Week deal! Overall, the experience was decent to average for what it's worth. The entrees actually seemed closer to Italian than Hawaiian/asian haha. My Szechuan style ravioli tasted good but something I could probably make myself (was like decent pasta with chili oil instead of olive oil). I had the same experience with my first course, the tuna belly misoyaki. The fish was cooked well, but it didn't blow me away. The chocolate macadamia brownie was really decadent - good but maybe a bit overpowering.Still a good deal for restaurant week ($60 for three courses) and a unique kind of cuisine to try with friends. The food is pretty fatty and rich. I'd go for dinner instead of lunch.",0
"The seafood here is hit or miss. Sometimes the seafood is overcooked and soggy, while other times it's great. The one at Grand street is always better. The service here is usually great, but on one occasion it was very busy and the staff was busy too, so it was difficult to get their attention.",1
"Overall, I thought the food at Obao was pretty good. They have a good selection of Thai and Vietnamese food, which was interesting. The khao soi chicken was nothing special, I thought it was slightly bland. It was very creamy and I wish there was a little more kick to it. The dumplings and calamari appetizers were also good, but the portions were very small. Overall, I thought it was a decent restaurant.",1
"Honestly though, 0 complaints. How can you for less than $6?? The quality here is probably hit or miss depending on the meat you get. Our crispy pork happened to be a bit more fatty but still had that insanely delicious crispy skin. Since we also got half char siu it balanced perfectly. Is it work waiting in the line? Depends. Can you probably get better quality Chinese BBQ? Yes. Is it worth supporting a local business that is a staple? Yes! Would I come back? Yes!Flavor: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5 pigeon park bench people watching city lfye",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The smothered chicken was a bit dry and I would've preferred that it was baked or slow'cooked in the gravy until it fell apart - though my sides, greens and mac and cheese were perfect as were yams. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
Stopped in for lunch and got the Lunch burger M-F ($8) with bacon (+ $1.50) and smoked mozzarella (+$1) .  The burger does come with melted cheese and for me the smoked mozzarella did not change the taste of the burger .  The burger  was well seasoned and delicious.  I think the standard burger is perfectly fine and no need to go with the extras.   This place is definitely worth stopping in again.,0
"Good fresh pasta, and good people.They make the pasta fresh in front of you.If you eat at the counter the chef normally comes out to check how it was afterwards, they definitely care.The main downside is if you do takeaway you need to eat it quickly, otherwise the fresh pasta gets pretty clumped up in a starch brick after say 30 mins.Try 2 or 3 of the varieties.",0
"This was a welcome spot after running into unexpected closing times elsewhere, and getting increasing hangry as I stubbornly declined to check out 3-star pizza places. The aloo masala was probably the best of the bunch, but the lamb and masala unda were also fine. I would take the advice of Josh B. from 2018 and skip the samosa chaat, and focus on the rotis. Yeah it's in the title but in 2018 I didn't understand such paradigms. Roti Roll Bombay Frankie offers an impressive amount of flavor in a short time.",0
Have ordered from here so many times and its always great.Yesterday I get my order around 1230 and its missing several ingredients including the dressing.I called seamless at 1235 and they said they spoke to the staff and had another one sent out. I had asked for an ETA because my lunch was almost up and I had meetings coming up and I specifically asked for them to call my cell phone to let me know when it is here so I can go down and get it.2 hours go by and nothing. So I call seamless around 230 and they call the restaurant again and the rep got back to me and said that they claim that it was left at the front desk with the receptionist at 115? but because it had been so long and its been sitting there for a while theyd make another and have it sent out in 20-30 minutes tops.I go to my receptionist at my office and nope nothing was dropped off. I even went to the lobby of my building and they told me that legally they are not allowed to hold food for people that work in the building.45 minutes go by and I leave my office to go get a granola bar and call seamless to let them know I need a refund for the order. I even offered to go pick it up in person because I figured the delivery dude brought it to the wrong place twice. I got a refund for the order and nothing else which is kind of ridiculous considering I wasted my lunch and a solid portion of my day chasing around a salad.I was really patient with them but super frustrated by the end of the day.Dont order from here because they will most likely screw the order up and then deliver it to someone else.,0
"Big fan of Little Tong: the food here was pretty good and definitely unlike anything I'd tried before. We got the Grandma chicken mixian, the mala dan dan mixian, pea shoots, & the garlicky tingling mixian. The pea shoots that we got to start were really excellent. Flavorful & perfectly cooked!The broths in the garlic & grandma chicken soups were incredible. They make such a flavorful, complex broth -- everything is perfectly spiced and the garlicky tingling mixian really did tingle. It would have been nice if there were a few more vegetables in the soups. Also, the chicken was PERFECTLY cooked. I will say that I was not big on the noodles. They were very bland and had a kind of soggy texture.We were disappointed by the mala dan dan mixian, which was overly sweet and also not saucy enough, so it just kind of tasted like sweet, slightly-boring noodles. All-in-all, the space is really cute, the service is good, and the food is fun and interesting. I really enjoyed Little Tong.",0
"Prince Street Pizza is a great spot for pizza lovers! The service is fast and the pizza is delicious. I ordered a single slice of the Prince Perfection (Secret homemade marinara sauce, with pecorino romano cheese, and extra virgin olive oil) & Mercer Margarita Grandma Style (Made with fresh garlic, extra virgin olive oil, fresh mozzarella and basil) with their brand named Creamsicle soda. My boyfriend ordered two slices of the Spicy Spring (Fra diavolo sauce, spicy pepperoni and fresh mozzarella) with a fountain drink.

The pizza was DELICIOUS. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and the pizzas were cooked to perfection. I'm very picky when it comes to eating pizza crust, but their crust had the perfect bite to it. My only regret was allowing my pizza to get slightly cold, but it was still flavorful regardless. My boyfriend also enjoyed his two slices and loved that it had so much pepperoni. He's not really into spicy food, but he approved of his meal and said he will go back with me soon! Overall, Prince Street Pizza is definitely a go-to spot if you're in the area and in the mood for",1
"Came here for Valentine's Day dinner. We sat in a heated outside enclosure which was very comfortable. Tables were separated by glass dividers and fruit tree planters. It was perfectly quiet enough for easy conversation without too much music or street noise. The cocktails were fantastic, my favorite being the Old Fashioned Au Poivre which was smoky with a zesty peppercorn flavor and a tangy dark maraschino cherry. Another good choice was the French bird which came in a pineapple shaped glass with garnish. The champagne sidecars were a great addition for $5 each. For an appetizer our server recommended we share the Detroit Tarte Flambee which did not disappoint. Topped with grilled onions and pepperoni cups, this deep dish pizza stick came with a side of ranch and really hit the spot. For our main we both chose the special of the day, a 24oz 28 day dry aged steak topped with truffle butter and a side salad. I prefer my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The meat was so tender and the fat just melted in your mouth. Cooked right on the bone it was truly and immense portion of steak. We didn't have room for dessert unfortunately and will have to try them on our next visit. I have already recommended the Quality Bistro to friends after such a great experience and look forward to returning.",0
"TabeTomo is definitely having its moment. Ramen, unlike most other Japanese cuisines, does not have a long history with tight strictures and old lure. In fact, ramen was invented 60 years ago and the noodles are actually Chinese. This allows the chefs to have more versatile approaches to the dish. Here in the US we grew up with dry ramen in the plastic package with the flavor pack and, if we were inventive, we add condiments for some taste. TabeTomo's ramen indeed has taste. The key here is the 60 hour pork broth that makes it very rich. I preferred the version where the noodles were on the side and you put them in a little at a time. The fried chicken is awesome (get the tartar sauce). Prices and service are great too.",0
"I've heard lots of good things about som tum der so I figured I should try it out. When looking at the menu, I had no clue what to order, as the options are pretty different from what I typically see at a Thai restaurant. The food was only alright and I couldn't really get myself to eat it all, as the rice was too fishy tasting for my liking and the pad Thai was a bit spicier than I expected.",0
"I had a wonderful experience at The Palm Court Hotel. The hotel is beautiful and has an abundance of fresh flowers and crystal chandeliers throughout. The palm Court had a beautiful setting and many palms. Our service was great, professional and attentive. We got the Manhattan tea with the Chartier glad of champagne and I thought the champagne was wonderful, very smooth. Our food was fresh with warm scones and soft bread (I read some reviews where this was not the case) and a huge pot of tea for each person. The fat we went everyone was dressed to the nines but was still a relaxing experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"You can order by using QR code and multiple people can order and view the same cart. We got the mild spicy broth split with bone broth. The mild is pretty stinking spicy so beware! Otherwise, service pretty good and quality of meat was good.",0
"I had a great time at Tagmo Indian Kitchen! All of the dishes we ordered were delicious and satisfying. I especially loved the goat and prawn dishes, which were both very well flavoured. The service was also very friendly and fast, which was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious Indian food.",1
"Han Dynasty is a great option for Szechuan cuisine. The dishes are flavorful and affordable, and the atmosphere is much more airy and less stuffy than the original location in EV. We recommend ordering classics like the dry pot with lamb and Dan Dan noodles, but be sure to stir them well before concluding they are too dry. The dry pot here is better than Best Szechuan's, and the noodles are thicker and more flavorful than what we've come to expect in Dan Dan noodles. Overall, Han Dynasty is a great option for Szechuan cuisine in the Twin Cities.",1
"Food was pretty good but service was really questionable.Nobody greeted me when I walked in even though I made eye contact with 3 different workers. Normally I'd let this pass since they were pretty busy, but when my friend came in ~5 min later they also ignored her. We both commented that it was kind of weird but moved on.We ordered, they served us some bread (YUM) and then our food started coming out. The second dish that came out wasn't what we ordered so we waved down our server and she told me that I must be wrong because she typed exactly what we said, was I sure? I told her yes. She took the dish and we saw her hand the plate off to another worker and throw her arms up in the air obviously unhappy with our interaction. After that service was what you'd expect- positive attitude and water + bread refills.We actually really enjoyed the food- the stuffed eggplant and the leek appetizers were incredible. They'll give you more bread but save it for when your food starts coming out! The main courses were fine but I think I'd just order more appetizers next time. The service left a really really bad impression on me. Having our server gaslight us was really weird. But ambiance and food were great.",0
"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Osteria Al Doge. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. My only complaint is that the bill was a bit high for the quality of the food.",1
"My favorite place is Saigon Shack... and this place is now my #1! The pho broth is so so good and has more body than other places I've tried. I loved the spring rolls, this is a must get!! It's so unique and I've never had anything like it and reasonably priced.We also got the fish tacos this was so warm, fresh and I loved the flavors! I can't wait to go back and try more dishes! This place is also very COVID friendly and our waitresses were very kind! Also if you go inside there's a very well hidden bathroom",0
"I had a great time at Porter House during Restaurant Week! The Caesar salad was amazing, and the petit filet was cooked perfectly. My husband had the cowboy rib steak, which he said was cooked well but would have liked it to be a bit more dry-aged. However, the service was really bad. Our waitress referred to us as ""kids"" multiple times, and never offered us a wine list. We'll definitely be back for the food, but hopefully they'll improve their service in the meantime.",1
"I give the place a 2 overall as some of the dishes miss the mark. However I'd give the biryani dishes a 4. The chicken tikka isn't very flavorful and dry. The naan bread came out 10 minutes after the entrees which is annoying as you are supposed to eat it with the dishes. We ordered a lamb kebab which we were told was very popular but it ended up being a minced patty like a thin hamburger fried on a flattop. Nothing ""kebab"" about that. I feel like naming it a kebab is misleading or that the server should or the menu should have mentioned it.Second time I went there my friend got a bite of food with some steel scouring thread in it. We pointed it out to the staff who apologized for it but they didn't really seem to care.  When we asked for the bill they didn't apologize or acknowledge that we had metal bits in the food. This stuff happens but a little more acknowledgement or apology would be nicer than pretending it didn't happen",0
"I have to say I'm deeply in love with the $5 pork belly appetizer I had here. I think it was part of the Kushiyaki skewer grille. It was unforgettable.I also had the Tan Tan Men ramen. I liked it a lot... I personally would have made it even more spicy but I think as it was, it was a lighter spice level that would appeal to many.  In terms of location, it's right next to Bibble and Sip which I think is just perfect. I will definitely be back to try the hot skillet pork belly and possibly also the Sutamina Ramen.",0
"I highly recommend avoiding Madame Vo if you're looking for a great bowl of pho. I ordered the Madame Pho, and it was a disappointment at $18. It was like California Pho which was better than other pho places in NYC, but still not justifying the price increase other than location. The Vietnamese Coffee ($5) on the other hand was very good and strong yet steady for the price. The service was fair though!",1
"Loved this. We popped in for a quick slice on a Sunday evening, and it completely hit the spot. The pepperoni slice was just the right crispness, plentiful with pepperoni, and there was so much flavor in everything - the cheese, sauce, even crust. Can't wait to come back.",0
"I thought the noodle had good ""wok heat"" making it very tasty. The chicken pieces were cooked with a bit of seat, also very tasty. The noodle was fine. An overall good dish.

The roti burrito wrap is tiny! From the images I thought it would be bigger  like a chipotle burrito or dos toros burrito. This is smaller. It was tasty with veggie crunch and peanut sauce. I wish the tortilla was warmed up or crispy via press, done something with it lol",1
"I visited this diner for breakfast this morning and I really enjoyed it! The classic diner foods are great and the service was great too. It was a bit quiet on a weekday morning, which I appreciated, and I'll definitely be back! I ordered the tuna melt and the grilled chicken Caesar wrap and both were really good. The tuna melt was cooked well and had a good flavor, while the Caesar wrap was really good with great dressing. Overall, I was really satisfied with my meal and I'll definitely be back!",1
"Los Tacos is definitely No. 1 in my book! The food was amazing, and the service was great. The only downside was that the line was long, but that's to be expected in a place like this. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for some delicious Mexican food.",1
"We had a great experience at Mee Noodle in Hell's Kitchen! The food was delicious, and the service was outstanding. Our fortune cookie was especially inspiring - thank you!",1
"I was craving the rice noodle with curry fish ball lately and was glad to find them at this place! I tried going on a couple of Friday afternoons but they were all sold out of either the rice noodle or the fish balls. However, I finally got them on a Saturday morning. Definitely go there early in the day if you're craving the rice noodle with curry fish balls so that they won't be sold out by the time you get there. After getting this item, we ate them right away even though it was hot. The sauce was so delicious and it was the perfect amount to eat the rice noodles with. Can't wait to come back again!",1
"I visited the restaurant on a weekend and there was a 30min wait. Unfortunately, I was wrong - there were no reservations. We ended up sitting at a table that was free, but it was clear that the staff didn't have enough people staffing the restaurant. The service was poor - it took forever for the food to come and even the soup and salad didn't come until about 15-20min after we ordered it. The food itself was average, I thought. I would recommend going to the midtown east location instead.",1
"I had a fantastic time at this beautiful restaurant on my birthday! The staff was very friendly and professional and the music was really refreshing and easygoing. The food was absolutely delicious - I especially loved the tuna tartare, ceviche and truffle fries. I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere was really trendy and modern, and it was perfect for a date night or a group dinner. The music was really loud, but that worked well in terms of atmosphere. The only downside was that the food was a little overpriced for the quality and complexity of it. For example, the cucumber salad was $22, which is a bit more expensive than I would have expected for that dish. However, the prosciutto appetizer was definitely one of the best things I ate all night. The ricotta was delicious and the meat and focaccia were both very fresh. I also ordered the 24k gold spaghetti, purely for the vibes. And even though it was only small pieces of uni, it was still a really good dish. The ragu was also really good, and my friend who had spaghetti said it was ""pretty good"". The tiramisu was a good dessert, but I didn't really enjoy it as much as the other desserts on the menu. Overall, I would give this restaurant a solid 4 out of 5 stars.",1
I came to Inari restaurant after seeing it on TikTok and I'm so glad I did! The mushroom and mushroom bulgogi were both amazing. I would definitely come back for either of them.,1
"I absolutely love Little Rascal! It's been one of my go-to spots in SoHo over the last 2-3 years and I'm so glad that they've made it through the pandemic. The cacik is so so so good and I can't recommend it enough. The wine is a decent price for the area and the vibe is great. The staff is always incredible and really help set the tone. I went back in February for my birthday and they offered my party blankets to keep us cozy while we sat outside. They were also accepting reservations which was very helpful. All in all, 10/10, love it, tell your friends, run don't walk. Love this place.",1
"The food here is not up to par, unfortunately. The appetizers were okay, but the pasta dish was terrible and tasted like something you would get at a diner. The main courses were also cold and not very tasty. The wine that was paired with the meal was also okay. Overall, this restaurant is not worth the price tag.",1
"This is a pre-COVID review. We had lunch at Le Coucou back in winter 2019. They offered coat check once you walked into the restaurant. It was a weekday and the restaurant was already half-occupied.Ambience wise [5/5] - Classy and elegant. Very nice place for special occasion Service Wise [3/5] - I found my server and sommelier a bit pretentious and cold. I know this is an ""upscale"" restaurant but a smile can definitely go a long way. Do know that a good dinning experience includes food and service Food Wise [4/5] -  We had the oysters and quenelle de brochet ""route de reims"" for appetizers. Oysters were alright but I enjoyed the quenelle de brochet very much. It gave you a creamy and almost melt in your mouth texture. We had halibut, bavette steak and duck for entrees. Generous portions and the duck won the show. We ended the meal with chestnut cake and chocolate tart. We had a pleasant afternoon and left with a satisfied belly. I definitely see myself going back in the future.",0
"I was really excited to try this restaurant based on the photos, but I was unfortunately not impressed. The scallion pancake as a wrap was my favorite item, but it was dry and lacked the crunchy exterior that I love. The braised beef was also very tough, which was a disappointment. However, the tater tots were a safe choice and they were delicious. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant, but I am sure their other items are worth trying.",1
I stopped by Valla Table for dinner and was really impressed! The yum beef salad was fantastic and the miang salmon was a really unique dish. Their service was wonderful and the atmosphere was really charming. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!,1
"I had a decent time at Grey Dog, despite the fact that the restaurant was quite cramped. The salad I ordered was average, but the wine was overpriced. All in all, it's a good spot for a casual meet up.",1
"Situated on the corner of Mulberry and Grand St, Gelso & Grand is a must when in the city. Whether you're meeting up for some drinks, or looking to have a romantic and intimate dinner, this is your place. Service is attentive, prices are fair, and portions are large. My boyfriend and I came here for our last night in the city. The weather was really nice out, and we easily got a table outside. I ordered the Mulberry Spritz while he got a Blue Moon. We ordered the burrata bruschetta as an appetizer and couldn't have been happier! The bread was crispy and warm allowing the burrata to melt into the perfect consistency. The dish was finished off with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper - get this dish, you definitely won't be disappointed!!For dinner, I got the Bucatini alla Bottarga, while my boyfriend got the NY Strip. The Bucatini was delicious; the lemon juice and the Parmesan paired perfectly balancing tangy and nutty. My only critique would be to cut it down on the sliced garlic as it became a little excessive after the 4th piece. The steak was tender and seared to perfection; the moment it was cut into, the juices from the meat flowed out - so good! It was served with a side salad dressed with a light vinegarette. This would definitely be a place that I would revisit next time I'm in NYC!!",0
Nice restaurant with great brunch. This place is located inside the Walker Hotel. Great atmosphere friendly service and staff. I had the chickpea fries which was delicious. I also had the Olive Oil pancakes which were nice and fluffy. My friends had the Chicken and Waffle sandwich which looked delicious. Will be back to try the Chicken and Waffle sandwich.,0
"The food here was ok. I ordered the pollo ala brasa along with the white rice and beans. I also ordered a cup of chicken soup. The chicken was cooked okay but I wish it had a little more flavor a little more seasoning to it the skin wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. The white rice was cooked properly the beans seem to lack some flavor. The chicken soup was absolutely amazing and I would definitely order that again I'm very hearty and light at the same time. The soup was perfectly balanced.

I recommend this as a solid place if you're in a rush looking for a quick cheap meal something to hold down an appetite I would definitely come here for a quick cheap meal.",1
"We stopped in here for a quick bite after a long day shopping in American Girl. This is a wonderful spot. Everyone is friendly and the place is nice and clean. We were promptly seated upstairs. There weren't many people in the restaurant so the servers were extra attentive. Our waiver was very nice and made great suggestions from the menu. We ordered the following food:Chicken Cesar Salad - just delicious. Everything was super fresh and the lettuce was crispy. The dressing was just the right amount, not too much to make it soggy and not to little for it to be dry. Grilled Chicken Sandwich - we ordered this with no bun and the chicken was very well cooked. The French Fries were not too greasy and had just the right crunch. Kids Grilled Cheese - amazing grilled cheese sandwich. The portion size was just enough. And it came with a side of fries. For drinks we ordered the margaritas. They were just ok. A little too heavy on the lime but still pretty ok I do think it was just a tad bit pricey but all in all the food and experience was great!",0
"Wo Hop is a great restaurant for Thanksgiving. The food is fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the location is easy to find. I would definitely recommend Wo Hop to anyone looking for a great Thanksgiving meal.",1
"Noz Market is the acclaimed Michelin-starred Sushi Noz's market next door. They have an outdoor dining service menu as well as different goods you can buy in the shop. The server explained to me that they use the same fish as Sushi Noz next door and have the same sushi chefs preparing it (not Chef Noz himself though, of course). He assured that the sushi chefs here are great. The sushi set here is plain fish and nigiri, while the much pricier Sushi Noz has a wider selection, more fish, and dressed nigiri with toppings. The price for the sushi set here is about $85 - pricey yes but far from the $400 per person at Sushi Noz. It comes with a salad, miso soup, a selection of nigiri and a tuna roll, and an ice cream for dessert. The fish in the nigiri was super fresh and great quality. I really enjoyed the simple flavors of it. The tuna roll was great as well. We also ordered some salmon and tuna rolls and they were perfectly rolled and wrapped. It was wrapped tightly, no falling apart!, and delicious. If it wasn't so expensive, I probably would have ordered another 2 rolls. The lychee ice cream for dessert was great as well. Only downside is that for this price - there are lots of other great sushi options in NYC. You could easily go somewhere else instead that has indoor dining service. And they might have been understaffed. There was only one server and things took suuuuch  a long time to come out. It was a pretty long wait for every single item. Much longer than I've waited at other sushi places with even more customers. Did I enjoy this spot? Yes, I did a lot! Would I recommend this place with so many other great sushi options? Not sure...",0
"I was enticed by the crazy milkshakes I saw people having, so I knew I had to get one. I ordered the Brooklyn blackout and beneath the glamor, was sadly, a very average milkshake. The burgers looked good though so I might come back for some real food!",0
Delizia 92 is a great neighborhood spot for a relaxing casual evening to sit outdoors and listen to live music. The veal parmigiana is great!,1
"The Cecil Steakhouse is a great spot for brunch! The staff was very accommodating and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the rum punch, which was perfect for warming up on a cold day. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others!",1
"Not sure how many Michelin Star Indian restaurants are in NYC, but this happens to be one of them. Widely popular place with some inventive menu items and presentation.  Friends hyped this restaurant up, but I found the flavors to be underdeveloped and lacking. Portions were super small (yeah, I get it - is a pretentious Michelin thing), but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be delicious. Service was clunky at best. Servers didn't even understand the menu items. At least get one of these right  - - service or food; or how about both?Space was elegant and not like your typical Bollywood production lot.Perhaps try an authentic honest Indian restaurant in the East Village or Gramercy.",0
"I really wanted to love this place but it's not what I expected. I got Chile Pork and Pollo a La Mexicana tacos and they were just very subpar. The chile pork was good but not spicy at all. I wouldnt recommend the pollo a la mexicana at all. The tortilla was falling apart and all the chicken was falling out. Also, the chicken had no flavor at all. The green sauce on top gave it some flavor and it tried to be spicy but wasn't spicy at all. Super disappointing. I also got the pineapple agua fresca which I enjoyed. Not the best but very refreshing. The staff was very friendly and quick, which I appreciated. Also the inside is decorated very nicely! Three stars for all that. Overall, I'd come back to try something else if I was passing by but wasn't my favorite food.",0
"The best tater tots!  Cooked perfectly, really crispy. Seasoned well, didn't need ketchup. A generous portion. The best tots I've ever had.",0
"""Holy Fuck Off Batman!""Seriously, during my visit here I felt like the waiter would have loved to tell me and my group to ""Fuck Off!"" I think the waiter's name was Oscar so avoid him like the plague if you get seated in his area. We were a large group of 12, we were enjoying a casual evening together and when our waiter came around we stopped and gave him the attention he needed to do his job. However, as he made his rounds to take our orders he literally would say, ""What do you want?"" ""What about you, what do you want?"" Then if we asked for beverage refills when he had a moment cause we certainly didn't demand he bring refills immediately he had a bad attitude, you can feel the negative energy. Ugh!Shitty waiter service aside the food was really good. Just sucks for my first time at this restaurant it wasn't a very pleasant one and I won't be back. My food wasn't free because if it was then I'd put up with crappy service but I paid for my food and it wasn't cheap.",0
"Visited Hometown Hotpot & BBQ yesterday for the millionth time - I'm surprised this is my first time leaving a Yelp review. My family and I like going to Hometown for our hotpot cravings because it's pretty solid. Food is good, service is good, it's AYCE, and the price is fair.Yesterday, I ordered the Curry Soup Base and loved it. I usually get the Plain Chicken Broth but I was feeling a little adventurous. For our ingredients, we ordered Fish Fillet, Fried Fish Balls, Beef Tripe, Beef, Lamb, Instant Noodles, Tong Hao, Pumpkin, Taro, Quail Eggs, Bok Choy, Seaweed Knot, and a couple others I can't remember. Overall they were all delicious. No complaints. I do want to point out the Fish Fillet, Beef, and Instant Noodles were extra good yesterday. Maybe it was just my mood, but those were the three stars of yesterdays meal for me.4/5 Yelp stars. We'll be back.",0
"My friends and I are staying in Harlem and decided to come here for brunch yesterday. It didn't appear too busy but we ended up waiting 40+ minutes for our food to come out. They were also out of stock on a number of items- mushrooms, ketchup, hot sauce. The food was definitely pretty good but I don't think any of us thought the wait was worth it.",0
"I've been going through some old pictures and saw this pub show up. I had genuinely forgotten I came here, but I'm glad I rediscovered this. I went to New York my senior year of college and met up with a high school friend who was at NYU at the time. The last stop of the day before we parted ways was here. Finding this bar was a great recommendation from my friend and it was great to be able to just relax and talk over a beer. The big positive I took away from here is how secluded the tables are from each other. It was nice knowing that even though Molly's is a smaller bar from what I remember, I was still able to have a quiet conversation with my friend. The service was really friendly and awesome. Thank you Molly's for this great memory, and I hope everyone is doing well. I'll be back the next time I find myself in New York.",0
Overall: great snack place with affordable and flavorful kati rolls. Fast service but don't expect authentic Indian fare.Came here for a snack after a long afternoon of studying at the NYPL right across the street. Highly recommend this place as a snack spot and not necessarily a dinner spot. The rolls were large and affordable and very delicious. Not necessarily the same as you would get in India but still very good. The service was okay and fast but not super nice. There is only outdoor dining - hopefully indoor will be opening soon! Overall recommend for a quick snack!,0
"Atoboy is a great restaurant for a Prix Fixe Menu. The appetizers are my favorite dish - the tiny tiny donut is amazing! The octopus dish is also great, with sweet potato and egg underneath it. The lamb main course was also very good, but the desserts were not my favorite. The uni was not fresh, and the yellowtail was unfortunately nothing special. Overall, Atoboy is a great restaurant with a Prix Fixe Menu.",1
"I tried the combination soft tofu soup at this restaurant and it was really good! The soup was really flavourful and the tofu was cooked perfectly. They also have some great lunch deals, so it's worth checking out. The staff were also friendly and accommodating.",1
"Food is fast, fresh, and tasty, but insanely salty.  Star for freshness! Quick pickup. I don't think I'll come again, but maybe in a rush. And a gallon of water...",0
"A small Italian restaurant near the Met: will return, for a little trouble (changing tables) and definitely for the desserts.Very good service: one of my friends asked to switch table because of the draft from the door, after we began working on our bread. The new corner table was as cold, anyway.The food were all decent: my headless brazino was good, the string beans were very tender. The filet mignon was ok, not steak house quality. The pasta was huge and the friend said, wasn't al dente enough - she hand makes her pasta, so you go figure her comment.The desserts are heaven: cookies, crème brûlée and tiramisu, especially the last two are g-r-e-a-t.The price, not this one alone, is on the high side. IF we pay a little more to support suffering businesses, I'm totally fine and willing, and wish them all the luck and long lasting.The last word: they've a single bathroom, up half flat up, at the end of the bar. As I exited it, I stopped to look at their wine cabin. The owner or manager (?) in suit, asked,""You like my wine?""""Yes,"" then added, ""I didn't order any because my companions are under age."" ha ha ha ... I'll have to think deep before I dine out them again.""I'll pour you a glass, my treat.""A brief struggle ... ""Thanks but no, we're about to leave.""Really, thank you! Stay strong and be well...",0
"It's been about a year and I'm still in love with LuAnne. Yesterday was my fourth time and it honestly keeps getting better!We had a pot of jasmine green tea, which was the perfect temperature and stayed hot throughout our meal. We started with the fried dumplings and wontons (which had a vegan cheddar that I was unsure of at first, but, together with the spinach made for the perfect wonton!) I think they must put something addictive in the soy sauce because it's unlike any other I've ever had. So good! We licked our appetizer plates clean then out came the main attraction. Call us creatures of habit but we ordered the same dishes we've gotten the other three times- Pad Thai and General Tsoys. Heaven. On. Earth. I'm not one to eat everything on my plate, but there's never any leftovers after a trip to LuAnne's. We've yet to be disappointed and I can't wait to return!",0
"I absolutely love Molly's! It's a super cute and cozy pub with amazing food and drinks. A perfect casual date night spot, especially in the winter. I love the colorful Christmas lights they hang year round that really give the place so much warmth. We recently came here on a Friday night at 7 and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a booth inside. They are sticking strictly to the 25% capacity indoors, but they also had an awesome outdoor dining section with heaters (and Christmas lights!) They used to have sawdust all over the floor which was really cool, but I believe they got rid of it due to covid. The tables were clean and the silverware all came in sterilized bags, we felt very safe eating here. As for the food (pictured) we ordered the following:-Reuben was spectacular, juicy corned beef with Russian dressing, along with some of the best fries I've ever had - steak cut and super crispy-Burger with American was perfect, onion rings were even better-Fish and chips are also great hereService was wonderful, our waiter / bartender was super friendly. We ended the night with an Irish Coffee and couldn't have been happier. Highly recommend!",0
"Overall, I liked IloveNY tacos, though I have to say that I wasn't blown away. The drinks were good, though I wish they had more happy hour specials. The food was okay, though I expected a bit more from tacos at $4 apiece. My biggest issue was the painfully slow service, which made the meal feel long and arduous. All in all, I'd say IloveNY is worth a visit – especially if you're looking for a quick and affordable meal.",1
I recently visited the Polish restaurant and was very impressed. The food was great and the atmosphere was inviting. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
"Overall, I thought the food was good at this restaurant, but it can be a bit pricey. The lobster mashed potatoes were my favorite dish - they were really creamy and well-seasoned. The mac and cheese was also very good, and I especially enjoyed the kick of the pepper in it. The chocolate cake was also delicious, but it was a little on the dense side for my taste. The wagyu sushi was also really good - the tuna was tender and the salmon was cooked perfectly. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a trendy spot with good food. Just be aware that the music is pretty loud, and the waiter may need to come over to help you out sometimes.",1
First time I ever tried lobster roll before!  The lobster was really juicy and the chowder was pretty good.  I wonder if I could have asked for it hot since I usually prefer my crustacean warm.   Came out fast and the service was great!,0
"Like others, I might have been a bit overhyped on this place, but it is still a solid kbbq spot around ktown. When you walk in, it smells amazing! The meat was cooked well, and are quality cuts. Nothing that was particularly special but definitely on par with other good kbbq places around. I definitely recommend the beef tartare. It was delicious, and I really liked the use of the Korean pear. Added a contrasting sweet and crisp texture.Don't bother with the seafood pancake. It was only ok, and the pieces of shrimp kept falling off as I ate. It felt like they were placed on top at the end and not well incorporated.I think pricing was decent. It definitely feels cleaner and higher end than other kbbq places nearby.",0
"Effy's Cafe on the Upper East Side was a place I was excited about visiting. I wanted an Effy's close to home for the dine in experience and for the Avocado Toast. I have been to the Effy's in East Harlem and it looks like I'll be returning to that location. It really isn't that far but they don't open early. As far as this location, I was told it's the same owner. The difference is this location is kosher. For me, I just wasn't as comfortable here. It's a beautiful spacious restaurant. The second young lady that waited on me was really nice and smiling. Up to that point I didn't feel relaxed with the service. I'm glad the Avocado Toast was only $6.00 plus tax. I could toast a piece of multigrain bread myself and slice an avocado on it! No effort in preparing or seasoning. I love the decor the most about the visit. The painted mural on the one wall is very cool. I'm glad I had the opportunity to be waited on for a reasonable price. I think I'm going to return to give them another try. I'd probably enjoy it more if I was with someone. A lot of women in pairs were dining together. It is a popular place.",0
"This place is all over-priced hype. To be honest, I never even heard of Jeju, let alone the fact that it had a Michelin star. My friend suggested this place for dinner and I thought sure, why not? I've never had Korean ramen before.

I saw that they are on Open Table, but I didn't see any availability. So we decided to just go at 5:30 on a Monday, because we didn't know how long the wait would be. The place was pretty empty, but it was also pouring, and a 45-degree day in May. I'm sure they're normally a lot busier.

To start, we had Toro Ssam Bap (fatty tuna, scrambled egg, tobiko rice, toasted seaweed). I really loved this. They give you this little sheets of seaweed, and you wrap it yourself. The egg was a nice touch. However, this cost $25, and I'm just not sure it was worth it. The appetizer costs more than the main.

Speaking of the main, I had the So Ramyun (veal broth, brisket, scallion, pickled garlic, garlic oil. The first few bites",1
"If ""authentic"" Thai means being treated somewhat condescendingly and having to endure uncomfortable seating where your knees are bashed against a table and hiked up to your shoulders, then I guess I will put up with Maomao for its tasty drinking snacks served on flimsy disposable plastic dinnerware.After the third dish where the server made me repeat the Thai name instead of the English ingredient, he clarified, ""I'm going to make you say the proper name for all of it just so you know."" Aggravating, but fine. I had the tod mun pla/fish cakes, pik gai zapp (fried chicken wings), sai krok isaan (thai pork sausage) and a pork sparerib soup that I don't see on their online menu.The pork sparerib soup was $18, and it was a hefty portion with probably 3-4 spare ribs worth in there. I loved the sweet/sour/spicy flavor of the soup. Lots of lemongrass, calamansi, and cilantro. The meat was tender as well. The pork sausage had a great snap and was tasty. I didn't really care for the fried chicken wings which were a little soggy, and the fish cakes were okay. I wish they were thicker.Maomao is obnoxious and uncomfortable but I guess the food is worth the schtick.",0
"Casual La Pizza & La Pasta inside massive Eataly was conveniently serving restaurant week menu that for $30 included options like arancini or salad to start and choice or pizza or pasta as well 2 desserts to chose between Panna cotta and tiramisu. We tried cacio e Pepe pasta and 4 formaggio pizza and both desserts . Everything was well executed and came out promptly. The pizza can easily be split for 2. Pasta was somewhat smaller serving but still enough for one . If you're still hungry , regular a la carte menu is available to supplement restaurant week one.",0
I love the shrimp tacos here and spicy margaritas. This is my go to spot for happy hour after work.,0
"We came to this restaurant during Hurricane Henry, and it was absolutely pouring rain outside! Nevertheless, the food was still amazing. We ordered almost everything on the menu and the standout dishes were the fried chicken and karaage, as well as the ramen. All of it was very tasty and satisfying, despite sharing. The staff was great and very helpful, and they encouraged us to order a sake bottle which was definitely the right move. We didn't have time to check out the ambiance, but we enjoyed the evening and the food, as well as the service. Can't ask for much more from a restaurant!",1
"What a solid lunch experience today. We did all the ""known for"" dishes, and I've now been indoctrinated to this establishment. Service is pro. Dishes on the menu look like average fare, however they are done +++100%. $19 for guacamole?!?!, but, yea, it was really good. The micro greens were spectacular, complimented the cilantro and lime. Empanadas that I can get at a food truck, three for $23?!?!  But yea, they were good too. Completely dry, not oily, super hot temp, flavors perfect, dough did its job. The raw fluke... flavors required me to close my eyes and feel the texture and taste in my mouth. The citrus oil was good enough to drink. As for the arroz con pollo, the crisp stole the show. I'm guessing they used par-cooked rice, it separated perfectly and the chicken was firm and soft in all the right places. Fantastic lunch spot, and I'll be back.",0
"I was really happy with Joe's Pizza. The line was long, but it moved relatively fast. The slices were really good, and I liked the lack of tartness of the sauce. The mozzarella was also good. One downside was that the crust was burnt on one slice, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend eating it nearby if you want it hot, because it cooled considerably by the time we walked the slices back to the hotel.",1
"Izakaya is a small hole in the walls restaurant that is always a great find. The chicken nanban is very juicy and addictive, the cabbage is indeed addictive, and the cucumber is refreshing and yummy. The salmon sashimi is good sized pieces and fresh, and the yakitori skewer is yummy. The izakaya pudding is kind of like flan, and the matcha brulee is personally I wish this was a bit more bitter. All in all, I highly recommend Izakaya for a casual meal.",1
"Ate outdoors at Canyon Road last night.  The hostess thoughtfully seated us under the heat lamp and all was well.  Our waiter was pleasant.  We went with a pitcher of their margaritas. We upgraded to their special house margos, which are less sweet and more potent.  They were good.  The guacamole was very good. The medium spiciness was just right. We all had variations of fajitas.  They were all very good.  The sides were very good too.  Above average food and value.  We''ll be back.",0
"Visited Hou Yi with my wife around 4:00 PM on a Saturday. It wasn't busy and they just opened.We ordered half mild beef spicy hot and half herb w/ pork as our soup. We also ordered various items such as pork belly, cabbage, fish tofu, etc. Everything tasted good. No complaints about food.Here's why I'm giving this place two stars. We were one of four groups to be seated. We observed two people manning the restaurant. On multiple occasions, we had to walk to the back to grab someone for another menu to order more items. When the third round of food was brought out, the waiter brought the check as well. We didn't ask for the check. As far as we were concerned, we were allowed to stay for up to an hour and 40 mins. It was only an hour at this point. Additionally, the plates that were brought out did not include everything we asked for.Overall it was a bad experience. Hopefully the other location is a little better.",0
"DA Gennaro is a great Italian restaurant that offers delicious food and great service. The only downside is that they do not offer free refills, so it can get a bit expensive. All of the servers were super nice and attentive, and I enjoyed my meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"This place is great! The chicken BBQ was amazing, and the cheese slice was fantastic. I really loved the new york chew to the crust - it added a lot of flavor to the pizza. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items!",1
"I found The Hummus and Pita to be a great option for a quick lunch in the upper east side. The falafel pita was fresh and delicious, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Tasted pretty good. They have a good selection of pho, rice dishes and vermicelli dishes.  Adequate seating and food came out in a timely manner. Soup was a little oily but not sure if that was just my bowl because my friend's bowl didn't seem as oily as mine. Otherwise, the taste was fine.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was great and the atmosphere was really cool. The only downside was that it was a bit on the pricey side, but overall I would definitely recommend it!",1
I love the salmon tacos here. They are covered in sauce and served with guac. They have great free chips and salsa here. Great atmosphere that is dimly lit and not too noisy. I will be back to try some of their margaritas.,0
"I was craving dimsum for months and was super excited to try this place out after seeing amazing reviews but was very disappointed with the food. I think overall everything was super greasy. Usually with dimsum, I get full from trying out so many different items, but I got full very fast from all the oil. I also felt like everything was super soft and made things hard to pick up. The dumpling skin was super gummy-like and was not enjoyable. Out of everything, I enjoyed the pan fried chive dumpling, but this was still very soft and oily. I would say that the stir fried vegetables also were relatively good and had a nice strong garlic flavor. I would like to say that even though it was a busy Friday night, the service was good, and we were not pressured to rush through our meal.",0
"I'm pretty happy with my experience at this restaurant. The food was decent and there's a lot of options for the baby, which is great because nothing was too salty, spicy, or greasy. The soup I got was really good, and the croaker fish was also great. The japchae noodles were a bit clumpy and dry, but I'm not really sure what could be done about that. The seafood pancake was also good, but I wished it came with some sort of sauce. The galbi was okay, but it was a little tough. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Electric Lemon has got it going on - great food, great view, and a perfect location for a weekend brunch. The eggs Benedict was a real standout, with perfectly seasoned potatoes and a refreshing lemonade frose. I'll definitely be back!",1
One of my favorite local neighborhood eats. Seriously out of this world yet so incredibly simple. Definitely can taste the quality in the food. I typically will come here at least 2-3 times a month. Its the perfect lunch or dinner and it doesnt leave you feeling heavy. The poached chicken is so delicious and juicy.The fries are crispy and had a great kick to it. Theyre covid safe which is really cool. And interior is nice and simple. The ginger rice has a great texture and compliments the poached chicken well.11//10 would recommend coming here!,0
"Cosme is a New York classic for true Mexican cuisine. The dishes all use traditional Mexican flavors and are creatively contemporary. The cocktails are the best part of the restaurant, and the service is excellent. I would highly recommend Cosme for anyone looking for a true Mexican dining experience.",1
"Went here for birthday brunch. They have a prefixed menu which includes entree's and drink and dessert for $22ish. Great value but taste was average, the plating wasn't impressed at all.. (Little parsley flakes on top of omelette would've been much nicer and fancy). We sat down upstairs which was very intimate and quiet but we had hard time finding our server to ask what we need. I am not sure if I wanna go back again..",0
This place is lovely! The decor is so cute and the atmosphere is very peaceful. Our waiter was so amazing and he was able to recommend a great espresso cuckootini for me. The food was really good and the portions were perfect for starters. I would definitely recommend this place to others and I would definitely return!,1
"Opportunity  grasped on this mid week viat to Eatily - the Flatiron store.  Overcast dreery day made this easy shopping as one of its quieter days.5 stats easily for fresh pasta, homemade sauces. a relieving selection pf Olive Oil direct from Italy and some from Sicily, some goos focccia bread coming out from the back, coffee, an amazing cheese section, fresh fish, and more.all kinds of imports, ranging from chocolates to Italiam tomatoes. Lotos to peruse and enjoy.Next door Earily has an Italian wine store with amazing help from Frankie who when asked aaid was Not Italian . He pointed me to a noce Tiscan wine, another of Italirs most popular wine type and even found me two move Gavi wines to try.Amazingly enjoyable place to shop and super helpful staff. All were just so nice it made the visit twice as nice.The bread was more commercial style than a local brwad place would make so that is the only thing making ie east to pass by. Some nice kitchen serving plates and bowls were there from Italy - had to lick up a fee For the focccia breads, mozzarella  and olive oil.",0
"I came to this restaurant for brunch a few times and the cocktails are always tasty. The food is also great - I've never had anything I didn't like. The service is always good, and the atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend this place!",1
"We decided to give this restaurant a try based on the positive reviews, but we were sadly disappointed. The tables were almost completely empty, so we thought it would be a quick and easy meal. However, the waiter took our drink order and then neglected to bring any menus or drinks until we asked for them. Our cocktails arrived with a lot of ice still in them, and the tapas dishes that arrived shortly afterwards were cold and reheated. We would not recommend this restaurant based on our experience.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but it could have been better. The duck was my favorite dish, and it was very tender. The fish, however, was a bit of a letdown - it was very bland and did not have much flavor. The desserts were also really good, although they were a bit too large for the restaurant. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to others, but not during restaurant week.",1
"We celebrated my cousin's birthday here and it was awesome!  The seating was different, you have to step down into your seat, not really easy to get out of especially with larger groups.  We ordered a variety of things and cooked them to our own liking at the table.  Everything was delicious!!",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very familiar and relaxing. One thing that I didn't particularly care for was the small taste of the shrimp dish. However, the other dishes were really delicious and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I really enjoyed my sandwich from this restaurant! The tomatoes made it a little bit soggy, but it was still really good. The avocado was also really fresh and tasted great. I would definitely order from here again.",1
"I wanted to like this place, but it just missed the mark for me.I was feeling adventurous (lazy) and wanted something fun to snack on and thought I'd give this place a try on seamless.I ordered the make your own combo and got a variety of 5 sticks, plus I had ordered an additional special stick that was suppose to have Gouda.I didn't receive one of the sticks, and upon (late) arrival, all of the food had gone cold and wasn't very appealing or appetizing. I also wish they had more dipping options, I believe they only had marinara and ranch. I'm giving them a 3 as I genuinely like the idea of this spot and appreciate the variety of moz sticks they offer. I just wish I had a better ordering experience.Oh! And the owner(?) texted me thanking me for my order and let me know all of their employees were those laid off from COVID, that was a nice touch. Though I also thought it was unique to get a follow up text.3/5",1
"Back in June my friend and I visited this restaurant for Brunello week.  The restaurant was dead and given its location, they were short staff.  We ordered from the Brunello week prix fixe dinner ($85 pp) - three course meal with two glasses of Brunello.  For the appetizer I ordered the Carpaccio di Manzo (thinly sliced raw beef with arugula salad and parmesan cheese) and paired it with a glass of Rosso di Montalcino DOC, Poggio San Polo 2018.  The dish pair with this wine was to die for and I devoured the whole thing.  My friend ordered the Insalata di Gamberi e Fagioli (Shrimp salad with cannellini beans and onions) along with the same glass of wine.  She loved the shrimp and the shrimp was huge.  For the main entree we ordered the Brasato di Manzo alla Toscana (Braised Short Ribs Tuscan Style) and paired it with the Brunello di Montalcino DOCG, Castiglion del Bosco, 2016.  We enjoyed our dish.  I know definitely devoured mine and it complemented the aroma of the wine.  We ended our meal with the tiramisu and misto Bosco al sorbetto di Limone.  The tiramisu was very good and it was sweet enough to mask the wines during the commute back home.  The service was not perfect because we felt that the dining experience was rushed and there were five diners and everyone was very socially distant.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying out this new gluten free restaurant, but unfortunately the food was inedible. The gluten free options are definitely growing in popularity, but I think this place missed the mark.",1
"I visited Zoku Sushi for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is located in a small furniture store on the left side and it had a very minimal setup. I only saw rows of bowls to be picked up and 4 containers though not sure what they contains in the refrigerator. The bowls were most likely the mealpal lunch item, Icelandic Char Bowl.

The bowl contained Icelandic Char, seaweeds, cucumbers and seasoned rice. I have forgotten how fresh Icelandic Char can be. The seaweeds are potent and cucumber are a nice balanced along with the Japanese rice which was seasoned well. I didn't see a menu that contains the prices. You have to try the fish!",1
"I had a great time at 886! The food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were fair. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"I had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The food was absolutely delicious - particularly the quesadillas, nachos, and burger. I also really enjoyed the home-made passion fruit juice.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others - it's perfect for a quick and tasty meal.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The pork porterhouse was very tender and the saba vinaigrette added a nice flavor to the greens. The focaccia was a nice touch and was a good palate refresher. I was a little disappointed that they were half an hour late with my order, but overall I was very pleased with my experience.",1
"The Mexican Chorizo scramble was quite tasty but the portion is tiny for the price, $15. The rest of the menu looks interesting.",0
"Stopped by specifically for the macaroons and was n disappointed! They had an amazing selection, numerous gelato flavors to compliment and great overall customer service. I don't remember which flavor macaroons I got unfortunately but I do remember they were good! Lol",0
I stopped by this restaurant for dinner and was really impressed! The food was delicious - I especially loved the lobster linguine. The atmosphere was really cute and the staff were super friendly. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!,1
"Pretty good pho restaurant. They actually speak Vietnamese here , and Cantonese too. Fast quick service.I ordered the pho bo vien and a banh mi. Both were delicious. Good food. Restrooms are adequate and clean. Would definitely come back here.",0
"Overall, I had a fun experience at this restaurant. The atmosphere is definitely fun and the pizza is definitely delicious. The only downside is that the pasta wasn't my favorite - it was cooked well, but I didn't love the sauce. All in all, a decent spot if you're looking for a fun night out.",1
"First time coming to Parm and the pickup was smooth. I went inside for pickup but the guy basically took my credit card but told me to go outside and wait. Which was a bit weird because if they had executed something different like put a sign on the door to wait outside, I would've done that. Anyways, we had gotten an order of the mozzarella sticks and the chicken parm sandwich. Mozzarella sticks were really good. I could taste the fresh mozzarella cheese they had used and the Mariana sauce complimented the sticks. The sandwich was delicious, everything tasted like it was quality which I had appreciated. Although the chicken was a bit on the thinner side, I really enjoyed how the white meat was not as tough and drying as some can be. I had really enjoyed the food here, it's just more on the pricier side. But you do get what you pay for.",0
"I had a great experience at Adyar Ananda Bhavan! The onion chili rava masala dosa was my favorite dish and it was really hard to choose just one. The food was also good overall, with aloo chana being my favorite dish. I wasn't blown away by the paratha, but it was still edible. The mumbai royal thali was a great option and I really enjoyed the curries. The only downside was that the biryani wasn't that memorable for me. The masala tea was great though. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I'll be back soon!",1
"On Seamless this spot is labeled as Dragon Sushi 83.  For delivery sushi, this place is average but delivers exactly as ordered.  Delivery time was on the dot! Door rang exactly one minute after the predicted time.  We ordered the Maki Boy Combo C-tuna, salmon, California Rolls for $15.95, Maki Boy Combo D-spicy kani, yellowtail jalapeno, salmon avocado for $17.95, 8 Piece Sashimi Appetizer ($11.95) and the Yellowtail Scallion Roll ($5.50).  The Maki Boy Combos come with either a miso soup or salad ... we got one of each.  The wasabi seems to have green food coloring added to it and the rolls in the Maki Boy Combo D were messily made (barely any rice on one side of the rolls).  They gave us 3 chopsticks, but the dinner was for two...think we eat a lot? :P",0
"We only came in for the french toast so can't speak to anything else, but the french toast was good! We got one sweet and one salty (salmon). I think you should really go with your general taste preference here since the toast itself was good all around: I liked the sweet one better since I have a sweet tooth, my friend liked the salmon/cream cheese one better.",0
"Frijolito's is a terrible restaurant. Their food is terrible, and their service is even worse. I ordered a plate that is named ""Pollo Asado."" In Spanish, that means ""grilled chicken."" So naturally, I expected to get that when my food was delivered. Instead, I got something completely different.

There was little-to-no actual chicken in my pollo asado plate. What little there was, looked like the skin or ligament of the chicken. The rest of the food looked like rubbish.

This was so bad, that I called UberEats and told them how this place misrepresented its food. They offered me a refund, and from there, I ordered from a place that serves actual quality food.

I will never order from here again. I hope for their sake that they improve their food, and stop misrepresenting what they offer.",1
"Overall, I wasn't blown away by my experience at this restaurant. The pork rice bowls were a bit greasy and the rice was cooked well, but I found the cuts to be a bit too fatty for my taste. The spring rolls were much tastier for me, though. I won't be ordering from here again, but it was fine in the context of the meal.",1
"I had a mixed experience at this restaurant. The waiters were a little unenergetic, but the atmosphere and the food were both good. I didn't like that my drink order was taken and then taken care of by other guests while I sat. Overall, I would recommend giving it a try.",1
"I love Wing Wednesday at this restaurant! The wings are great, but you can't go wrong with any flavor. The buffalo is my favorite, but I also really like the honey chipotle lime and the guava barbeque. In addition to 50 cent wings, they serve some strong happy hour drinks, which get me pretty buzzed. Eventually I'll try their other food, but I just love wings.",1
"Go! Bowls of spicy (tingly) broth with hand-pulled ribbon noodles and lamb. Eat it! Get some dumplings too. It'll cure what ailes you! Sit at the window-view  counter and watch Broadway go by. Next time, scallion pancakes.",0
"The Boil is a great place to go for seafood. The prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is great. I've taken my parents here and they've both had a great time. The location is great, and they take reservations so you can be sure to get a table.",1
"I made reservations at 8:30 - please note that during COVID times and NYC mandate, since all restaurants need to close at 10pm, the latest you can be seated is 8:30 to account for ordering time and eating time. We reserved a time to eat at the greenhouse huts - while there isn't a heat lamp inside, the ""indoor"" hut provided some relieve from the cold. It was 45 degrees out and I was able to take my jacket off. We ordered the gem salad, truffles pizza and cheeseburger. I had the junmai sangria and my partner the IPA. We both enjoyed the food. I will definitely come here again.",0
"I've come here many times over the years and this is one of the few German beer halls in Manhattan. 

I am not much of a beer person, but I always find a beer I can tolerate and they do have a full bar when I am in the mood for a cocktail. 

For food, they have all the German staples like pretzels and sausages, etc. 

The food quality is not the greatest in the world, but it is very good and has always been consistent over the years. 

Lately, I have been going with German expats that seem to love the place. 

The service is generally very good and the servers are informal and friendly as well. 

On top of that, the prices are reasonable, so you can sit with friends, eat and drink, sit at one of the long tables with your friends for hours and have a great time.",1
"Absolutely beautiful food! Their menu is great for sharing, with a mix of mezzes and mains. We got the smoked hummus, the chickpea and fava falafel, and the grilled eggplant. Everything was cooked perfectly and plated so prettily. It was quiet for a Saturday night, and the service was quick and warm. I would love to come back here for brunch and to try one of their desserts next time! I also definitely recommend their cocktails, especially the XYST Tonic.",0
Wonderful staff and delicious food. The tuna was a bit over cooked for me and I asked for it rare to medium rare but other than that the Brussels salad was delicious and the pastas we had - Pesto with orrichetti and cacio de pepe were satisfying. I would not say these plates are super substantial so definitely order starters!,0
"We had a great time at this wine dinner! The appetizers were delicious, the main courses were well executed, and the desserts were amazing. The only downside was that we felt a bit drunk after dinner. The wine was definitely flowing! The only thing to note is that the ride home was a bit expensive thanks to Uber. Overall, this was a great experience and we would definitely recommend it.",1
"This place is so good. I got it as takeout recently & it was so fun eating in the restaurant when I went in person pre-Covid. The waiters are so cool and wear the best clothing, and the vibes are impeccable. I also love the food! It's incredible. The jerk chicken comes with mango chutney which is SO GOOD, and the fries are excellent. My friend ordered plantain and the ox and loved his meal as well. Definitely going to order from here again and will be back in person!!",0
"The first time I frequented this place was over a decade ago when I lived in the area. Now, almost each time I'm back in the neighborhood, I try to stop by for a bit, but let's face it, it's usually for a cup of coffee and a croissant.  I remember when I was in school, it was a great place to come to on Sunday morning while the city was still waking up to enjoy my cup of coffee and croissant in the open air.  I've found the service always kind and generous; also, if you're ever in a hurry, they can accommodate that as well.  I wish there were a Max Caffe where I lived, but I also don't want to encourage it to become a chain.  It's nice that it's still there after all these years and serving up the reliable joy it always has and the way I remember each time.",0
"I'm giving Joe G's three stars, but only because my husband loved his pepperoni pizza so much. My pizza had something to be desired... a margherita pizza has always come with tomatoes and plenty of basil, and mine had neither. Someone else in our group help the same and ordered more in the side. Prices were okay (between $12-15 per pizza and small enough that each person should order their own). I wasn't totally wow-ed by this place, especially because it had come so highly recommended. We were also a bit bamboozled by the entrance, because you have to walk DOWN stairs into it from the street (but it was neat regardless). A couple of blocks from Times Square, not far from Rock Center and Central Park so the location is pretty key if you don't want to venture too far away. But, be assured, Little Italy is a 15 minute train ride away and would certainly offer higher quality stuff.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant last night! The drinks were great, and the bartender was really friendly and accommodating. I recommend the frozen Paloma drink, and the jalapeño tequila floater on the frozen Paloma was a perfect addition. I also enjoyed the chips and guac, which looked delicious. I can't wait to come back here!",1
"Solid for happy hour but a big mistake for food.We ordered arancini and wings and both were a big miss. The arancini came with four of the teeniest arancini that I've ever seen. The dipping sauce was weird and unidentifiable. The wings were small, cold and rubbery. I was hungry and couldn't stomach more than one which is saying a lot.You can find a slew of happy hour drinks here on the cheap (wine, beer, wells, etc). But for food I'd definitely head elsewhere.",0
LOVED their rooftop! First I want to start by saying that our server LK was beyond AMAZING!! She made my family feel welcome  from the moment we sat down. I asked her for suggestions and she gave us the best suggestions. Now the food:  The have a new menu so of course we had to try the new items...love trying new things. We started with their chopped cheese empanadas (A crowd favorite and I can see why!!!) their wings which are air fried crispy! We had their new item the popcorn chicken...it's a must try they were perfectly breaded and so delicious! For our entrees ww has their lobster and shrimp mofongo (also a crowd favorite...IT WAS DELICIOUS!) the chimi burger a Dominican Staple Burger it's BOMB!! The Lomo Salteado which is a Peruvian dish with rice OMG they cooked it PERFECTLY! I mean it's fair to say that I left Elite a happy camper and I can't wait to go back ASAP!!! I need to try the rest of their yummy food! Ohhh before I forget they make the best drinks!! You can put it on these customized watermelons that are just super cute!! Highly recommend it,0
"SETTING:  Taqueria is snuggly nested in between Electric Burrito and La Palapa. Taqueria 's dark, uninviting windows, and unappealing exterior decor makes it easy to ignore, dismiss, not see it, and being hesitant about going in. AMBIANCE : Imagine walking into a dive bar in a small town in the south or the Midwest. What would it look like? Oh would the guests be? Well, welcome  to Taqueria. The walls and ceilings are covered with posters of Sublime(bravo), the late great Kobe, the Beatles, Van Halen, Farrah Fawcett, random old Mexican films, Guns and Roses, and James Dean. Taqueria is dimly light and there's a bunch of cheap and festive trinkets to liven up the place. The vibe here is laid back, fun, and very relaxed. There are two tv's at the bar to watch whichever sports game are on. This place is ruled by tranquil Millennials and Gen Xers? Or is it Gen Xs? FOOD: cheap, unpretentious, greasy and surprisingly yummy food! DRINKS: Dry January for me, but they have standards drinks and a very limited bar. SERVICE: Great. Bartender was chilled, attentive, and struck up a conversation with everyone at the bar. Food came up very quick. VERDICT: More dive restaurants are needed in NYC.  I felt super comfortable here, and I could see myself making this one of my permanent spots.",0
"I had a great experience at Bamboo House! I ordered lunch from here on seamless and it was really good. I got the Hot and Spicy Beef Lunch Special which came with an egg roll. The spice wasn't too overpowering, which I appreciated. I also got the pork friend rice which was cooked the way I liked it. (Some places make it terrible, this place got it right.) The portion was perfect for lunch and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend Bamboo House to others.",1
"NY doesn't have a bustling barbecue scene, so obviously I wasn't expecting the best barbecue of my life when I came here 4 months ago for dinner.This seemed like a fun place to dine at, given their outdoor dining area and live music performance stage downstairs. The ordering system implemented here was rather unique and that you're provided with a card with all the items offered listed and you hand this card to the servers. The servers will then check off on how many pounds of meat you're served and you'll later hand this completed card off to pay when you're done eating. My party and I had their moist brisket, prime rib, jalapeño cheese sausage and pulled pork, We also had their mac & cheese, baked beans with burnt ends and collard greens as sides. Overall, nothing really stood out to me. Sure, the food was good, but there was really nothing to write home about. Their barbecue sauce was a nice complement to the meats. A few hours after I finished dining here, I was overloaded with sodium and had to get up several times in the middle of the night to drink water. They have several televisions throughout the venue televising sporting events and live performances at set times in their basement. I see HCBM as more of a place to grab drinks and watch a game rather than a quality barbecue place.",0
"So now that we live in Florida and good pizza is something like a unicorn - a mythical creature that you would love to believe in but it simply doesn't exist (or its extremely rare).  So back in the big City we decided to grab pizza for lunch on the day of our arrival as we were staying nearby.Again, the place was packed and we got a table right away.  Service was good, not great but definitely good.  Went for a simple salad and pizza.  The fresh arugula salad with parmigiano cheese was fresh, simple and delicious.   We opted for the funghi pizza.  Cremini mushrooms quartered was interesting - you usually see them sliced or chopped but this ensured mushroom flavor in every bite.  When done right, you cannot go wrong with Neapolitan style pizza - and they do it right here.  I would absolutely recommend this place and I would definitely come back here for the pizza.  I think if they get stable folks on the service end, this place can get continued high marks.",0
"I stopped by this Chinatown restaurant for lunch on a hot day and was pleasantly surprised. The outdoor seating was very small and cramped but it was air conditioned, so it was a nice respite from the heat. The noodles were delicious, with a great flavor and a bit of a chewiness that I liked. The duck was also very good and quite large. The pork soup dumplings were also tasty, and a good size for a main course. Overall, this place is great and will definitely be returning.",1
"Becco is a great restaurant for anyone looking for a meal after they see or show. They have quick service for a theatre crowd, and the food is always delectable. They have outdoor seating too, which is great for people watching when the weather is good. I especially love their Daily Pasta Preparations where you can order that and get unlimited pasta from the three varieties they made that day. If that isn't up your alley, the regular menu is also superb. My most recent time, I got a filet with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fish was coated with potato flakes and it was so moist and delectable. The asparagus was tender, and the mashed potatoes were perfectly garlicky. I also love getting the panna cotta for dessert. Servers are always friendly and complimentary, have a lot of patience, and are experts on the menu. I will continue to come back here when I'm up in New York!",1
"This is one of those chains that looks like a place I would be popular but I haven't heard of it.  I think they have some good branding but the one confusing thing was that I thought it would be fried chicken centric place. It is not and is more like a chipotle/qdoba centered around chicken.  It is one of those fast casual concepts that are popping up throughout the city. The mojo chicken was decent.  It was moist and had good flavor. It came with different sides in a bowl type lunch. We also tried the veggie plate (spiced carrots, roasted broccolli, mac and cheese, kale salad) so that we could try a lot of the sides. Mac and cheese was creamy and tasted relatively fresh. The spiced carrots and broccoli were both delicious. I could have done without the kale salad.It wasn't very busy for lunch so we were in and out quick. They didn't allow indoor seating but had a couple seats outside.  The food was good but not sure it warrants a return visit.",0
"Keens is a classic and Iconic Steakhouse. They have good service and the decor inside is super old school, classy, elegant, I really liked it. The service was on point, overall a wonderful experience.I got the Limeade Spritzer to drink, it was really good. The limeade is also delicious, my friend got like 3 refills on it.I had the lobster bisque, it was really good! I wish it was a bit hotter when it was served but the flavor was great anyway.For my meal I had the steak sandwich and a side of fries, the steak sandwich was really good and I added the grilled onion it came with before I ate it, this really made the sandwich just right.Prime rib: was very good as well, nice flavor, what prime rib should taste like.The porterhouse: was also good, nothing amazing.Yukon Mash Potatoes: they were pretty good as well, not my favorite but defenitley not bad.Desserts here are great! They serve Eileen's cheesecake! It was so delicious, my favorite cheesecake ever. Very Light and fluffy while sill being rich.Chocolate cake: Nothing crazy, the cake portion was a bit dry but the rest of it was good.Overall Keen's was delicious and a good experience. I am glad I went, it is nothing I would go out of my way for, but worth a try",0
"The wait on a Monday night was about 30 minutes but once inside, it was worth waiting for. I tried the medium spicy mandoo soondubu to mix it up and it was good although my favorite is still the mixed soondubu with seafood and beef. The seafood pancake was also really good and the banchan which included the fried croaker was good.",1
"I tried out this new spot in town and overall it was a decent experience. The square pizza with pepperoni was really delicious - the crust and thickness were both delicious. However, the corners and sides were a bit overcooked for my taste, and the sauce was a bit dry. Overall, it was a decent local place, but I wouldn't make the trek.",1
"Bleeker Street Pizzeria is one of my favorite pizza places in New York City. The nonna maria and the Sicilian pizza are both amazing. The pizzas are filled with flavors and are on a thin crust, which makes them very delicious. Ordering was quick and efficient, and the guy placed the pizzas in the oven and in a few minutes those babies came out piping hot. I regret not getting a pie!",1
I love the smith! The chips with blue cheese are out of this world along with there famous Mac n cheese I can't say enough good things about the smith! They have something for everyone and I highly recommend coming here. Staff is wearing masks and handling the food emphasizing safety!,0
"Hermana NYC is an excellent restaurant. The food is great, the drinks are great, and the service is great. The real draw for me is the music. Live jazz, pretty much every night. This isn't karaoke or something comparable. This is real live jazz music by phenomenal musicians and vocalists.

The food is great as are the drinks, but both are eclipsed by the service. These are genuinely friendly people that want you to have a good time. I hope folks stop by Hermana to listen to some tunes and just enjoy the vibe.

Note that they add a modest cover charge for the musicians to your bill.",1
"I thought Lashevet was a great restaurant with attentive service. The dips and bread were very good, and I especially enjoyed the hummus. The tabouleh was fine, but the main dishes were not as good as I had hoped. I had the chicken kebab and rice, and the chicken was very succulent. The rice with peas was pretty bland, and the salmon didn't have much taste. The cauliflower was perfect, however. Overall, I thought the food was good, but the flavors could use a bit of a boost.",1
"This is a solid diner. I dined inside and definitely felt good vibes. It has that classic diner smell and feel. I ordered the Lumberjack meal which came with pancakes, bacon, sausage, ham, and eggs. Everything is just kind of piled onto the plate. The pancakes are very good here--little crispy on the edges, firm on the outside, and fluffy in the inside. The bacon and sausage were great. The ham was a little thin and felt more like a sandwich cut. All and all, this is a simple diner; no frills or anything exotic. Kind of exactly what you want. I'll be coming back again whenever I'm craving diner food!",0
"We had a great experience at The Butcher's Daughter, particularly thanks to the friendly atmosphere and great food. The avocado toast Benedict was especially delicious, and the generous portions made it very affordable too. We'll definitely be returning next time we're in New York!",1
"The food was really good, but the spice level was way off. I couldn't even eat it because it was so spicy. I had to go buy some hot sauce to make it edible.",1
"I have been to a lot of Michelin~ level restaurants and to be honest this has been by far better than the vast majority of those experiences (and with a lower price tag)I love this style of small plate style restaurant with creativity because each dish carried an element of the unexpected. This restaurant captured what I want most out of a fusion restaurant which is -- a feeling of surprise and enjoyment that one can share with others. Mokyo allows you to admire each new small plate, share your thoughts with your companion on what it may taste like and then share that feeling of joy and surprise on what it tastes like.Our favorites were the corn dumplings (which I did NOT expect to like), the lobster roll, the octopus over rice. The steak and the jowl and the yellowtail were really good too. The ox tail spring roll was unexpected but not INCREDIBLE in my opinion LOL.The pop rocks was a really fun dessert reminiscent of the shooting star flavor from baskin robins 31 in South Korea -- and the injeolmi mousse was really really good.All in all, so glad we came here! This has been one of the best meals I've had visiting NYC so far. And At it's price point will be most likely the best! Stop by if you can grab a spot!",0
"I thought this place was really good. The meat was cooked well and the portions were generous. The only downside was that the seafood pancake was only ok. The shrimp kept falling off, but overall it was a good meal. The prices were also reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"This bar provides the perfect level of class for a nice date in LES. It was really nice to sit at the bar and see the chefs prepare the hors d'oeuvres. The grapefruit sangria had a really refreshing taste, and didn't taste like it had much alcohol, but I definitely could feel it.",0
Food was underwhelming. Honestly forgot I tried the burgers before so got it again and it was not worth it. I thought that the last time I tried it lol. Branzino was so good! I love the veggies it came with and everything went well together. Wagyu was so buttery and good but also too heavy. I liked it with the salt. Cheesecake was good! I ordered it since it was my bf bday and it was really nice that it was on the house. I expected to pay but it being complimentary was really nice. Service was really good but slow. It's cool to try but not sure it's worth the money.,1
"I stopped by Covid for some Ramen and it was really good! The portion sizes were really generous and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The only downside is that the dining area is a bit small and it's more of a take-out spot, but overall it was a good experience. The only other thing I could mention is that the service was a bit odd, but I'm not sure if that's just because of Covid right now.",1
"Came back here for the first time last month in over six years and unfortunately they went way down. We came on a Sunday because they allow you to BYOB without a corkage fee. The best part of the meal was our wine that we brought ourselves. When we sat down I noticed my bread plate looked as if it had already been used, which is unacceptable anywhere but especially in a restaurant of this caliber. The items on the menu look good but the prices are absolutely astronomical for what you get. I wasn't expecting a TGI Friday's portion of food but the portions they give you are absurdly small. We aren't huge eaters and we actually went for a slice of pizza afterwards. My pasta was just okay. My partner ordered the venison, which was so incredibly bland. Most restaurants tend to over salt but this was one of the first times I've experienced a restaurant grossly under salt. We didn't bother to waste our money on desert after such a disappointing dinner. They gave us some free cookies with our check. Nice gesture but clearly came from a box. It's also worth mentioning that even though they may encourage a dress code they in no way enforce it. We sat next to someone in a hoodie, sweatpants and sneakers. I know it shouldn't matter but that really did make our ""fancy night out"" seem like a lot less. Do yourself a favor, save a couple hundred dollars and eat elsewhere.",0
Aesthetically pleasing and super yummy food. One less star because matcha horchata was wayyyyyyyyyyy to grainy and wasnt even able to drink more than 1/4.,0
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and it was so mushy and did not taste very fresh. The only redeeming quality was the shrimp tempura I also got, but even that was subpar. I'm not sure if I'll be returning.",1
"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday around 6 to make sure we had time to catch their happy hour (half off beers and wines). They had a small selection of familiar local beers, but enough to satisfy most tastes. The wine and cocktail selection was much more extensive. No issue getting a seat when we arrived, but by the time we left around 730 there was a considerable wait for a table. I had the hatchback, I loved the balance it had between the kick provided by the chiles and chorizo and the mellow flavor from the crema and white base. The chiles reminded me more of banana peppers than I expected, but it still tasted great. The only small complaint I could think of would be that the chile to chorizo ratio was higher than I would've liked, but it wasn't egregious. My friend ordered the vodka pie. I hadn't particularly enjoyed vodka slices from Detroit style places in the past, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried one of his! The sauce had a fairlymild flavor, allowing the caramelized cheese on the crust and light garlic to shine through. It tasted like you took some of the best cheesy garlic bread and dipped it in some vodka sauce. Your experience with the portion size will definitely depend on how hungry of a person you are. I thought the pie was the perfect size to be quite full but not hate myself. However I'm a very hungry person, so I could see a group of 3 people splitting 2 pies and being very satisfied or 2 not very hungry people even sharing one. Overall, I think this is a great spot to try out a wide range of an incredible style of pizza (if you haven't tried Detroit style yet you need to fix that ASAP). They have enough toppings options to satisfy any taste and I certainly could see myself coming back here soon. Your experience will vary in terms",0
Spot Dessert Bar is a great place to go for dessert in the city. The golden toast I ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.,1
"Probably the best momos I've had in Manhattan! This place is also BYOB so we were able to bring our own beers and enjoy their food. We ordered the lhasa momo combo, which included 4 vegetarian and 4 non-vegetarian steamed momos. I really enjoyed every bite - it was hot, juicy and well seasoned inside. The service was a bit slow, the water that was served to us wasn't the cleanest, hence I'm not going to give 5 stars, but would love to be back and try out some of the other dishes on the menu.",0
"I haven't been to Pastis since they reopened, so I decided to check them out. I arrived for dinner on a Monday in March this year, and it was unbelievably packed for a Monday night. Ambience, decor, and music were great. 10/10.People dressed up including myself. I mean, I never shy away from an opportunity to dress up, it's Newyork after all.We were seated at the crowded bar, and shortly Afterwards led to our table. We started off with escargots and steak tartare, which we gobbled so fast, and forgot to take a picture. It was just that good.For Mains we had the Branzino and the hangar steak, my steak was 10/10. Every dish was truly a delight. I would totally return here. Servers were professional and very quick with the service. Bathrooms were really clean. I will be back.",0
"I came here with a friend on a Friday night, having made my reservation the night before. I was a bit skeptical because I had been to the Black Emperor Bar pop-up and I did not really think it was anything special but I am glad I decided to try it again because I had a much better experience.We ordered the honey-butter tater tots, the cheese rice cakes, the Big Bird sando, and the clams. I avoided the burger because despite the high reviews of the burger when I was at Black Emperor Bar, I did not particularly enjoy it. (And to be honest, the Big Bird Sando was not my favorite, so if you are not a huge fan of burgers/fried chicken sandwiches, I might not recommend ordering anything from that section of the menu.) The clams were spicy and flavorful, and by far the stand out of the night. Highly recommended. I would go back just for the clams - they were that good. The cheese rice cakes kind of reminded me of a Korean-Mexican fusion, which I found to be unique and enjoyable. The tots really did not do much for my friend and I and were basically the only thing left on the table after the meal. Would not order the tots again.I think the good things I listed above were done really well - with some of the other menu items just being average. I definitely prefer Nowon to some of the other fusion places I've been to in the neighborhood, like Thursday Kitchen and I will definitely be back.",0
"More spacious than it looks from the outside. I thought the dumplings here would be more like the usual Korean filling style with tofu and glass noodles mixed in, but surprisingly it wasn't. Was seated pretty quickly at 7pm, but service is pretty slow. It's good that they offer smaller portions of the dumplings at half the price so you can pick another small appetizer to mix and match and it would still be filling. All orders are served with a salad with carrot dressing, and the pickled onion chili pepper soy sauce dipping sauce for the dumplings. There are more condiments if you prefer plain soy sauce or hot sauce instead.Ordered:- Goonmandu (small, 4pcs) ($5.50) - pretty good, decent amount of filling inside, mostly pork and chives. (4/5 rating)- Yukgaejang ($6) - has egg, burdock root, beansprouts, green onion, kelp and a bit of beef, not much. Wasn't too spicy, filling if you order another side dish with it. (3.5/5 rating)",0
"Overall, I thought the Taste Good restaurant was decent. The service was great and the food was decent. I especially liked that the food came with plenty of rice and chicken. The egg roll was a bit smaller than I expected, but overall it was a decent meal. I would definitely come back here in the future.",1
"The pizza had a lot of the qualities you look for in a good pizza - good crisp, good cheese, hot, and fresh. However, the oregano was very overpowering and noticeable, and the saltiness was also off-putting. I can't remember having pizza where an herb like that was so noticeable. I thought it was too much where I regretted eating there.",1
"I recently visited the restaurant again and it was just as great as the last time. The setting is really comfortable with socially distanced tables and attentive masked staff. I was able to see my friends again and Sean and his team took care of us.

We started with seafood. The shrimp was exceptional, firm and with the requested horseradish and cocktail sauce. The crab cocktail was also very good. The salad was an interlude, but it was exceptional, thick and juicy fillets. The steak was cooked to each person's specifications and it was very tender.

June was more rare and it was delightful. The salt and grill on the exterior drew out the flavor of this ultra tender steak. What a great night. I highly recommend this place!",1
"Perhaps the best Peruvian chicken I've ever had.I grabbed a few items for dinner from here including a half chicken, arroz chauffa and some really interesting item called saltipapa. It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready.The chicken itself was half shire and half dark meat but the skin and meat were super flavorful and juicy. Far more flavorful than other Peruvian chicken places I've been. It didn't need the green sauce it came with so I used that on the other dishes.The chicken and soy sauce in rice were good. Lots of chicken in the rice.The saltipapa is just a bunch of hot dogs cut up and mixed with French fries. I've never had it before but this was good. The fries were on the soggier side and the hot dogs tasted similar to the Hebrew national brand.All in all I'd come back here for the chicken itself and maybe a few sides.",0
"I went to La Barra with some friends after attending an Elite Yelp event. The drinks were expensive, the service was slow, and the food wasn't great. The croquettes were good, the chicken skewers were great, and the location is nice. I don't think I would go back, though.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at New Kim Tuong. The roasted pig was definitely one of the highlights - it was incredibly crispy and seasoned perfectly. The soy sauce chicken was also excellent, and I really enjoyed the ginger scallion condiments. Overall, the prices were very reasonable, and the food was very good - I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try!",1
"I visited this restaurant and found it to be ok. The food was not particularly memorable, but I did enjoy the mango dessert. The price was also reasonable for the amount of food I received.",1
"Gotham Pub is a great place to eat if you're in the area and need some sustenance. The pints of Guinness are always poured well and the pub fare is always solid. The pub fries are particularly good and the place is well worn, so it's definitely more of a sports pub than a tourist trap. Surprisingly, it's not as touristy as I would have thought given its location close to Penn Station. Overall, Gotham Pub is a great option for a quick bite.",1
"I was very impressed with the quality of the espresso at this small, quick-service restaurant right next door to Grand Central Terminal. My rose cardamom latte with oat drink came out to $8, which is a bit on the expensive side, but definitely worth it given the quality of the espresso. I would definitely come back here if I were in the neighborhood, but would not necessarily make it a regular stop due to the price.",1
"We had a wonderful time at this new restaurant in Manhattan. 

The appetizers and deserts were especially delicious, including the oysters and onion tart. 

Deserts included a peach and chocolate desserts. 

The entrees could use some refinement. 

including the lobster with potato (odd) and the pepper beef (which was a bit tough).

The amuse bouche was a bit flat, but the service was excellent and the beautiful setting was a bonus.",1
"I have been wanting to try Vezzo for a while now since I've lived in Murray Hill for 2 years, and it finally happened! The restaurant has an old-school Italian feel with a casual yet elevated atmosphere.Pro tip: they don't take reservations and won't seat you until your whole party is there, so it's best to go at off-peak dinner times. We went at 6 on a Saturday and were seated right away, but by 7 the restaurant was at capacity.We started off with the quinoa and avocado salad which my friend picked out. I was reluctant since I'm not the biggest salad person, but I'm so glad she ordered it. The salad was to die for!!! We split it and still could not finish because the portions are huge.I then ordered the pappardelle al funghi and my friend ordered the big pineapple pizza. Both were excellent. The pizza was some of the best I've ever had, and that's coming from a New Yorker! The pasta was incredible, but again so large. I ended up taking half of the pasta home and eating it for lunch the next day.All in all, I can't wait to go back to Vezzo and am so happy that I found such a great, cozy spot in the heart of Murray Hill!",0
"Better than El Gordo in Vegas!  And it's not as crazy, but still pretty busy.They have an organised system:  line-up, order and pay, get a ticket, and give ticket to taco assembler man!  Each taco were ~$4ea and from the looks of it, the quesadillas weren't much bigger.  2 tacos were enough for a snack/light meal. The Pollo was soo tasty and was quite stuffed, even though the shell was small.  Shells were also really tasty and did NOT fall apart - my pet peeve!There's no places to sit.  It is just a really busy ordering counter and you eat elsewhere.Really good!",0
"This is a somewhat upscale Asian fusion restaurant, which leans heavily Chinese. The atmosphere and service were excellent, and it's definitely a place to see and be seen.  The food was all very good, though I don't think it was any better than any other good Chinese restaurant you might visit. You definitely pay for the ambience and environment.  I got the lobster with ginger and scallion, pork wonton soup, soup dumplings, and spring rolls. While the prices are all a bit more inflated then you'd expect, the three shrimp spring rolls for $22 was a stand out.  They were very good, but I've seen priced.I would return for date night, or some other special occasion, but not for a casual dinner. Go for the service and environment, the food is good, but nothing stellar.",0
"Nothing bad to say about Arturo's. Easy to make reservations for same-day. Prompt and attentive service. Good prices. Lots of outdoor seating. Digital menu. Artichoke hearts casino appetizer was so different from anything I've ever had. I loved it. My favorite of the table. Garlic bread with cheese was so satisfying. Mushroom pizza was very good, not the best pizza I've had, but very good. I loved how thin and coal-oveny it was. Deserves to be as well-known as it is. I just wish the free jazz on Sunday nights was happening! I'd love to return when things are back to normal just for that (and that artichoke app).",0
"I had a great time at Gramercy Tavern celebrating my friend's birthday! The food was excellent and the atmosphere was really cozy and charming. Although the burger wasn't my favorite, the sea bass was really delicious. I definitely recommend going to Gramercy Tavern if you're looking for a great dinner!",1
"A good HH spot because of the deals they offer. It's pretty spacious inside, but definitely try to get there early since people tend to seat themselves sporadically leaving odd number of chairs empty in between. They have the swinging chairs right by the windows, but those seats are the first to be claimed; two midtown uniformers claimed those spot even before HH started. Recommendations:- Impossible Taco- Nachos (has impossible taco meat as a topping) - Guac & Chips",0
This was a great find with superb customer service from I believe the owner. Nicely decorated. Bright cheery and very good selection of beers. The food was very good and well presented. Will definitely eat there again!,0
"I had a great time at this Thai restaurant - the food was great and the service was great as well. I especially loved the drunken noodles and the red curry. It was not too spicy but it had just enough kick to it. I just wished they had more noodles on the plate for the drunken noodle. The place really IS a small Thai kitchen, but I didn't mind because it was not too crowded when I was there and I got a Groupon for 20 bucks worth of food for 10 bucks. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"I really enjoyed my lunch at this restaurant! The $1 Ritual app deal was a great value, and the pan-fried classic dumplings were delicious. I did find, however, that the dumplings often came apart at the seam, making them very difficult to eat. But overall, I thought the service was good and my order was ready on time. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Rasa. The food was fresh and tasty, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. I especially loved the butterfly pea flowers that were used to color the nasi kerabu. The only downside was that some of the dishes didn't really wow me, but nonetheless they were all very good. I especially enjoyed the salted egg shrimp and the durian puffs. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Rasa to anyone looking for a good Malaysian restaurant in the area.",1
"I came to this restaurant with friends for dinner on a Wednesday night and we ordered the seafood ramen hotpot, tiger roll, wings, spicy pork rice dish, and roasted vegetables. I was really looking forward to trying out the food here because I love seafood ramen but unfortunately, this meal was a huge disappointment. The portions were way too small for the large price tags and the flavors just didn't hit home for me. The wings were good though. The only things I enjoyed were the tiger roll and the wings. I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Ippudo is a restaurant that I've been wanting to try for years, and I finally got the chance while I was in New York for COVID. 

The pork buns were okay, but the ramen was not that special. 

I had the classic tonkotsu, and found the broth to be a little boring. 

The noodles were deliciously chewy and the chashu was tender, but the dish as a whole was a bit uninspired. 

We also ordered a bottle of sake ($50) which was a nice accompaniment. 

I don't know that I would go out of my way for a return visit, especially since they do not accept reservations. 

But for an inexpensive meal of famous ramen, it may be worth a visit.",1
A neighborhood hole in the wall joint that serves comfort food. Delicious soups and tacos.,0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was great. The decor was really beautiful, and the setup was really long, so there was plenty of seating. The bar was really quaint, small, and homey, and the staff was really friendly. My favorite dish was the ribs, and the french toast was also really good. The only thing I didn't like was the spice in the noodles, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely come here again with friends or family.",1
"Happy Lunar New Year! Gong Xi Fa Cai!Thanks for the recommendation, Fulton! Today, I came here for an early dinner at Uncle Lou. We were seated at a long table for the 9 of us. Holy moly, I was sitting diagonally across from China Mac. I am always starstruck being in his presence. Beautiful Chinese lanterns hung from the ceiling throughout the restaurant. Our server Eddie provided excellent service to us. Food: *sharing is caring*Homestyle Chenpi Duck (1/2)Crispy Garlic Chicken (1/2) - yummy Baby Bok Choy with Garlic - yummy Fried Salt & Pepper Squid - *hubba hubba* my favorite dish Beef Fillet Sauteed with Garlic Chives - *hubba hubba* my favorite dishCrispy Orange Beef - yummy  Pea Shoots Sauteed with Garlic - one of my favorite vegetable dishes  Peking Pork Chops - yummy Note: There are two restrooms located in the back of the restaurant!",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by my first experience at Boulton & Watt!You can now book Boulton & Watt via the Seated app which makes it super easy to get a reservation.They have an awesome cocktail/drink menu, in addition to a food menu that is sure to have something for everyone.We made it in time for happy hour which meant $14 cocktails were only $9. A $9 cocktail in Manhattan is nearly impossible, so it was nice to know that this is a spot I'll return to for happy hour in the future! I opted for the Mexican Revolver, a tequila drink with prosecco, lime and agave. Simple, but not too sweet.To start I shared the housemade burrata appetizer ($16) with roasted delicata squash, caramelized onions, grilled country bread,ricotta, aged balsamic, basil pesto. I love basil pesto so I knew I had to try this and can recommend this mix of bread, veggies and excellent buratta.My main course was the tuna burger which was also delicious. It came topped with pickles, sriracha aioli, and slaw on a brioche bun. It was filling and a nice change from a beef or veggie burger. The fries on the side were thin, perfectly crispy and had a wonderful rosemary flavor.Our server was super friendly and was above and beyond, even on a busy Friday night.I would certainly recommend and return to Boulton & Watt!",0
"I needed to set up a lunch date w an out-of-town cousin who wanted vegetarian or ""simple food.""  Had to be near Moynihan Station.  Yelping around, I found several places that we could eat at, and sent her links to see the menus.  Her choices were this or the Tick Tock Diner.  I chose Hudson Yards for the quieter ambiance, as we haven't seen each other in about 4 years and we wanted to catch up.  This restaurant was definitely quiet and spacious, clean restrooms, tourist-priced entrees but more or less going rate on the salads, and that was fine for lunch!She had their Grains and Greens bowl, with quinoa, chickpeas, and veggies.  I had their Roasted Beets and Arugula salad, supposedly with spinach, arugula, and romaine.  Probably 90% or more romaine but nice and crunchy, with plenty of little beet chunks, some creamy delicious goat cheese, and topped with some crunchy shallots.  Tasty balsamic dressing, just a bit too much but the salad wasn't drowned by any means.  My cousin asked for some bread.  The server was accommodating and quickly sent over a plate on which there were two (I didn't want it but it was the right thing to do) rectangular rolls.  White bread, not my thing, but she ate one just to help her stay full on her upcoming train travel.They have a nice little interesting cocktail menu but we opted not to have drinks, just some nice, cold tap water and we asked for a glass of ice.  Service was pleasant and not at all rushed.  I'd made a reservation but we arrived at least 10-12 minutes earlier and they weren't at all crowded; we were greeted and seated right away.Overall, it was fine, but nothing special.  You could do much worse, and I doubt if the salads cost a whole lot more than the diner would have cost, with a much more upscale atmosphere.",0
"I'm always looking for a good fast food option when I'm in Penn Station, and Moe's is definitely one of the top contenders. The staff is very fast and efficient, and they always seem to be engaged in some kind of personal conversation - which helps keep the line moving even faster. The food area can be a bit messy at times, but it's understandable when you have so many customers coming and going. I always get the Joey Bag O' Donuts - it's one of my all-time favorite sandwiches. The only downside would probably be the nachos - they're a bit bland, but they're free, so it's not really a big deal. Moe's is definitely a great choice for a quick meal - and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in Penn Station.",1
"The Maze is a great place to go with friends for drinks. It's dark and trendy, and the atmosphere is perfect for a night out. The food is okay - I'd recommend it as a nice option after a night out in K-town, but I wouldn't normally eat here.",1
"I don't know what the hell we just ate, or rather mostly didn't eat, but that may have been some of the most disgusting dishes we've had in a long time. It was just nasty tasting. Hubby claims the guacamole was okay.  But the rest of it was just horrible. Waste of money. Just run.",0
"I ordered  20 piece wings with hot buffalo on the side and spicy lemon pepper on the side. Well I got my chicken and it looked good, nice crispiness not over cooked. But then I got this shot glass of sauce. Three small container of sauce barely enough to cover 2 pieces of chicken. Now I have to eat my chicken naked. Well I said it was nice and crispy but it lacked alot of flavor. The meat was barely seasoned. I good costing does not account for unseasoned meat. I will say based on the crispiness of the chicken in going to try this place again but this time I'm getting my wings sauced",0
"This is my second time here and I really enjoy it. Lots of veggie options and I love their fish fillet and ramen. You have a few choices with the broth. I always think I want the herb to be ""healthy"" but let's face it, we all need some spice in our lives. The spicy broth is my fav. Other tasty ingredients to order include the tofu skin, lamb, and wood ear mushrooms. They also have a nice selection of soju. I recent learned I like the grape flavor the best. If you check-in on tell, you get a free scoop of ice cream as well.",0
"Such a great value for the food you're getting and right in the heart of Rockefeller Center. My coworker and I went for lunch and did the prixe fixe option for $35, such a great value. Very great seafood restaurant. For our apps, we got the Mediterranean meze and the crab cake, which were both pretty standard. I wouldn't say they were out of this world amazing, but decent for the price point. As for my main, I got the Loup de Mer, which was extremely tender and cooked very well. I love sea bass, so this dish was right up my alley. The fish was definitely very moist as well. As for dessert, we were both trying to watch what we ate, so we just had the seasonal fruit. Overall, this place is well worth the price and a great deal especially for being one of the fancier restaurants around Rockefeller.",0
"I was really looking forward to eating here after hearing from several people how good it is but we were pretty disappointed. I don't know if we ordered the wrong things but I've definitely had better Thai in the city. We started with the scallop skewers which were delicious! For entrees we got pad Thai with chicken, panang curry with chicken and Kea mao with veggies.We enjoyed the pad thai. The panang was average and the kea mao was way too salty for me. I asked for kea mao to be a little less spicy but after getting it I think the normal spice would've been fine. The restaurant itself is beautiful and our waitress was excellent. They even combined two tables to give us a little more space on the table which was thoughtful. We didn't feel rushed at all. I may come back to try the fried rice but overall I think I'n gonna stick to my usual Thai spots.",0
"The food here is OK, but it can be bland at times. The prices have gone up recently, but the portions seem to have decreased. The service has never been great, but I guess that goes along with the name change too.",1
"Personally, I felt that the sauce was lacking and hasn't been as good as it used to be.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend it for brunch!",1
"I ordered the lemongrass porkchop vermicelli and couldn't have been more please! They did an amazing job balancing all of the flavors and textures, and the dish still felt incredibly light! The food and drinks definitely rocked my socks. The ONLY only reason I can't give it a 5/5 was because we asked to sit at a table on the right side of the restaurant (it looked nicer and was more distanced from the other diners), but the hostess/waitress said that they had already cleaned those tables and wouldn't be seating anyone there anymore. Not 10 minutes later, two new groups were seated over there...I'll most likely come back, though, if I'm ever in the area. Fingers crossed they won't be weird about seating!",1
"I experienced no wait time at all. Like the restaraunt name, there was plenty of soup options. I got the tofu kimchi soup- part of the lunch special. It came with rice and side dishes as usual. They gave us raw eggs to put in our soup so that i'd cook while the soup was still boiling hot. She encouraged me to mix it and not just drop it in so the yolk is dispersed. I also tried the Korean rice punch. It came in a small can and apparently it's cheaper and bigger at H mart- which is on the same block/area as BCD Tofu. Nonetheless, it was pretty interesting with the rice pieces at the bottom. You need to use a straw to drink it or else you won't really get the full experience/ drink. I wouldn't get it again though. Overall, I prefer Five Senses more. The expensive prices and small variety of food don't make sense for me to come here again.",0
"I had a great experience trying out Greedy Pot for the first time! The oxtail dish was delicious and had a great flavor. I was really impressed with the amount of browning that was included, which is essential for a Jamaican style dish. The rice and peas was a great side dish and complimented the oxtail perfectly. The prices are very reasonable and I would definitely recommend this place to others. I'm looking forward to trying some of the brunch items like shrimp and grits and salmon cakes in the future.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that the air conditioning wasn't working very well, making it a bit uncomfortable to eat. But overall, it was a great experience.",1
"SO good! I've been wanting to try this place for a while and it was everything I imagined. We were able to get in with no reservation on a Friday evening, which was surprising since I figured this place would be more popular! We started with the burrata appetizer and loved it. My friends ordered the gnocchi with vodka sauce and the lobster gnocchi, and I got the tris signature dish ""for two"". Honestly, one person can absolutely get this if they're hungry enough (which I was)! All three of us were extremely happy with our choices, highly recommend for dinner!",0
"This restaurant replaced Cutting Board, and honestly, I cannot say I'm a fan.Because it's their soft opening, there were many items unavailable on their already very limiting menu. The concept of the restaurant is similar to hotpot- you are a served boiling soup base and a side of rice noodles, and you are given cheap ingredients to dump into the pot. Unfortunately, it's more like a cheap sampling (ie. one fish tofu, one slice of ham, one quail egg, 3 thin slices of pork etc).For $10, I left still feeling hungry and unsatisfied, so it just was not for me.",0
"We had a great time at Pig Heaven! The restaurant itself is really trendy and unique, with lots of interesting pig decor. The service was really friendly and it seemed like the staff were regulars - which is always a good sign.

The food was great - the chicken was especially tender and the ribs were fantastic. The bbq sauce was really tasty, and the fish dish was also really good. It's a great place to go with friends, as everything is really tasty and you can share things.",1
Not sure if i came just before closing but seems they just took a leftover dry overcooked paratha and added chicken and egg and just gave it to me. I grew up having Kathi roll so i can say with authority this was a sloppy leftover that was given.,0
Ok so this spot is really cool. Located right in the village and has great veggie options as well. It's basically a Chipotle style dry hot pot bar. You choose all your protein and veggies and they cook it for you. They also have the yummiest dumplings! We watched them making them fresh!I had a huge veggie (with tofu) bowl and my friend had all kinds of meat and seafood. We shared veggie dumplings. We were so full I had to pack half to take home. Great value for the price too!Open now with safety measures in place. Please support your local restaurants!,0
"I'm from LA and apparently we don't have good pizza out here. Now, I had no clue that was true until I started dating a New Yorker. I went to nyc for the first time and ofc pizza was on the to do list to see if it lived up to the hype. Joes is his favorite spot to ""grab a slice"". This is foreign territory to me because LA you gotta buy the whole thing. Anyways we got our slice really fast and ate inside. It's a little grungy inside but it's part of the vibe I suppose. Delicious. Omg. I went back and order two more slices. Completely ruined my dinner by turning a snack into a four slice pizza meal. TLDR Needless to say LA's pizza is trash and this place is bomb.",0
"I was not impressed with NY's barbecue scene when I visited four months ago for dinner. This seemed like a fun place to dine at, given their outdoor dining area and live music performance stage downstairs. The ordering system implemented here was rather unique and that you're provided with a card with all the items offered listed and you hand this card to the servers. The servers will then check off on how many pounds of meat you're served and you'll later hand this completed card off to pay when you're done eating. My party and I had their moist brisket, prime rib, jalapeño cheese sausage and pulled pork, We also had their mac & cheese, baked beans with burnt ends and collard greens as sides. Overall, nothing really stood out to me. Sure, the food was good, but there was really nothing to write home about. Their barbecue sauce was a nice complement to the meats. A few hours after I finished dining here, I was overloaded with sodium and had to get up several times in the middle of the night to drink water. They have several televisions throughout the venue televising sporting events and live performances at set times in their basement. I see HCBM as more of a place to grab drinks and watch a game rather",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at Bar Boulud. The waitstaff were fantastic, and the food was good. The only downside was the price, which was a bit on the high side. I would definitely go back, and I would check out the epicerie next door too.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and overall it was decent. The food had a good selection and the outdoor seating was pleasant. However, the service was poor. Our waitress was very impatient and often came to our table asking if we were ready. Additionally, she was very curt with us, which made us feel uncomfortable. Overall, I believe this restaurant is good for lunch but may not be the best choice for dinner.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The lunch specials are unbeatable and the staff is always so friendly. I've tried a variety of items on the lunch specials and my favorites are the cheese enchiladas and the hamburger. I've never had to wait to be seated, and the food always arrives quickly. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great lunch option!",1
"I was heading to the 86th street train station after spending time at Guggenheim and Cooper Hewitt museums.   When I looked at my phone, I noticed The Hummus and Pita was close by.   I dropped by to have a late lunch (around 3:30pm).  I was taking the subway back to Brooklyn.  I have to admit the falafel pita I ordered was quite fresh and delicious.   It was pricey.  However, I was in the upper east side.   If I was in Brooklyn, it would cost me around $5.50.  This place charged me $8.   I like the location.  Moreover, the restaurant was clean.",0
"I stopped by the Russian Vodka Room after dinner this past weekend and the place was pretty empty. The bar is brightly lit up though, thanks to fairy lights. I ordered the Lindsay Lohan cocktail and it was sweet and delicious. The Fickle Blueberry cocktail was also good, but a bit too strong for my taste. I would definitely check out the food here next time I'm in the area.",1
"I was really disappointed with the pizza at Grandpa's and Johnny's on Dyckman. It was doughy, soggy and a bit too greasy. In comparison, the pizza at Grandpa's and Johnny's on Broadway is far superior. That said, even crappy pizza is pretty good...so it's got that going for it I guess.",1
"Got the chips and guac which was pretty good and then three tacos, the steak, chicken, and carnitas. The tacos lacked salt and flavor. Badly needed sauce. Meat was dry and homemade tortillas weren't good and fell apart. Also rice on tacos? Not sure. No booze which didn't help matters. Won't be back.",0
"The flavors and textures were good. They were very aesthetic and the service was great too. But I think I wasn't completely mind blown about the dishes especially the jackfruit salad, there was barely any jackfruit in it, it was mostly papaya with a few shreds of jackfruit. I wouldn't find myself wanting to keep coming back especially since it's a bit pricey. It was nice to try it out though. My friend and I appreciated the bottomless brunch option and that they didn't seem to skimp out on making it bottomless.",0
I discovered this place after walking uptown from the Gym and I was pissed when I saw a woman eating a slice of pizza at 11 am after I worked out and she made me want a slice and join her... I ordered a slice (at a different time) and I was surprised by the size of the slice. It is a typical NYC pizza spot but to be honest it is a bit pricey but a simple cheese or pepperoni slice is good and will satisfy your craving. They have really good buffalo chicken wings that can be shared with friends. Super delicious!,0
"I went to the restaurant late one night and found that they were open until 2 am. The late hours are great, but the prices are high for the quality of food. For example, one slice of pizza cost almost $15, and only one slice had protein (pepperoni). The crust was doughy and greasy, and the vodka slice tasted like nothing. The grandma was the best slice, though the cheese was definitely strange, sort of gummy. They do have root beer in glass bottles, which is always a plus. Overall, I would recommend the restaurant, but I would caution people against spending too much money on food that isn't really that great.",1
"I have been a fan ever since I tried out the instant ramen and wanted to actually try the real deal! I met with my friend at 6pm and we were seated at a communal table where shoulders were touching each other. It's definitely a tight space. We ordered the Tonkotsu and the New Tokyo chicken. Tonkotsu was decent, noodles were al dente, pork belly could be better charred. My friend didn't like hers at all, said it needed more flavoring. Service was friendly but that's where the points were deducted...I understand it was busy and dinner time but they rushed us THREE times by asking if we were done with the ramen. It left such an unsatisfactory dining experience and I'm so disappointed.",0
"Their soup base is very good, and lots of options.Free adding extra noodles. And highly recommend to try their appetizer!They open 24hrs so good spot for late night snacks.",0
"I think this place used to have a location in Fidi which I went to once. So I thought I knew what I was getting into when I came here for lunch with a coworker. I got the Tom Yum soup with tofu. The broth was very, very bland. It tasted like they'd heated a pot of water and added some chili to it. The rice noodles were plentiful, and it was nice that they gave me the option of fried or steamed tofu. I went with steamed (probably not the best choice given how bland the soup turned out to be). My reco? Go with the safe options here. I think their dry noodles are  more flavorful (e.g. pad si-eew). And their spring rolls are excellent: perfectly crispy. All in all, there are a lot of good Thai options in the city, so I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are desperate and hungover. They have a cure for that: drunken noodles.",0
"Restaurant Week dinner at this French restaurant was a nice experience overall, but I didn't think the food was worth the price tag. The appetizer of shrimp covered in apple, mint and other garnishes was my favorite dish, and the branzino was cooked well. However, the main course was a bit simple for my taste - I would've liked to see more flavor in the veggies and sauce accompanying it. The dessert was also average, and didn't wow me. All in all, I thought the meal was good, but not great. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the outdoor seating in the front was a nice touch.",1
"The Bistro Burger at this restaurant is definitely a delicious and affordable option. The fries are a bit on the bland side, but overall it's a great burger. The only downside is that they could use a bit more seasoning.",1
Decent all-day breakfast and lunch spot in soho. Nice outside but we were seated in the back. Salad with salmon was good and well cooked. Beet dip was oddly sweet.Kids enjoyed waffles and sandwiches. Meh.,0
"I recently visited QR Code Restaurant for lunch with some old friends and had a great time. The restaurant is located in a small shopping center and had a few individual hotpot tables set up in the entrance. We checked in and received our temporary menu tattoos, then moved to our table.

Everyone at the restaurant uses QR codes to order their food, so it's easy to keep track of everyone's orders. The table next to us ordered and ate their lunch while we waited for our own food.

I ordered the Spicy Hotpot with pork bone, beef, shrimp, and vegetables. The broth was not spicy at all, but the pork and beef were delicious. The shrimp were a little overcooked for my taste, but the variety of vegetables made up for it.

The staff came by to remove the empty plates and refilled the water frequently. They were also quick to bring our food.

The price point for QR Code Restaurant is $25 per person, which is a bit higher than average, but the quality of the food makes up for it. I would definitely visit this restaurant again.",1
"had decided to check this place out bc of a youtube video that showed a michelin star chef and his family eat here quite often but quite frankly i wasn't too impressed. the restaurant itself is very cute and trendy but the combinations were odd (especially the vegan options) and some of the sauces too overwhelming so it was hard to taste the raw items themselves. nonetheless glad i tried, but dont think id go again. best ones to me were the poke, ikura, and most of the fried ones. least favorite was the eggplant. the appetizers were good! however we got the cookie to go and wasnt a huge fan.",0
"Hide Chan Ramen is hands down my favorite ramen restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. The broth is rich and flavorful, and the chashu is top-notch. The chicken katsu curry on the side is a perfect addition, making this meal complete. The waitstaff is friendly and the service is fast. This is the perfect place to go for a quick meal or to catch up with friends.",1
"Don Angie is a great restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is great. The only downside is that it is quite small, so it can be difficult to get a reservation. The charred broccoli dish was forgettable, but the stuffed garlic flatbread was really good. The sopressini and smoked mussels were also good. The ravioli special was really good, with truffle, sunchoke, and straciatella. The black cocoa tiramisu was also good. Overall, I would definitely recommend Don Angie.",1
"My rating is more of 3.5 stars for Obao. Made a reservation here on a Sunday night with friends to enjoy a nice dinner. This location is definitely smaller than their other location. The restaurant wasn't extremely packed, but the service was still a bit slow. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share as well as our own entrees.- Kimchi fries - tasted great, fries were still crispy- calamari - I would pass. The batter was soaked in sauce and there wasn't much flavor- spring rolls - pretty standard; can get the same taste and flavor for much cheaper at other places- chicken wings - small but tasted good- lobster pad thai - I enjoyed the pad thai; it was on the sweeter side, which I was not used to. There was a lot of flavor and the lobster was pretty big. (the lobster was MP, so it really depends on the day you go. Mine ended up to be $40)- Bun bo hue - not spicy at all and was still full of flavorBy the end of our meal, everyone was so full. Overall, the food was decent, but also it wasn't anything extremely special to justify the price. At the end of the day though, I still enjoyed the experience.",0
"I had a really enjoyable experience at this restaurant! The interior was really lovely and the dining hall was spacious. I did the 5 course tasting and was glad I did because it allowed me to try different types of fish. Everything was really well prepared and tasted amazing! The chef really took note of all of our allergies and made great replacements. My only complaint was the gimbap. It was very salty and that was the only thing I didn't enjoy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for their 5 course tasting, but I would also recommend doing the 7 course tasting if you have the opportunity.",1
"India Row is a great place to go for Indian food. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. The only downside is that the restaurant is new and the decor is not yet finished, so it can be a bit noisy.",1
"I found this place while still seating on the boat from Statue of Liberty. I wanted to go visit China town and a quick search brought up this place as the one you shouldn't miss.The food is simple: meat and cabbage on a bed of white rice. I chose pork and duck and hubby got pork. Two large for about $15 bucks. A steal. The char shiu pork is one of the best I ever had. The lean part is not dry and fatty part not greasy. It's a consistent texture on every bite, slightly sweet and seasoned so well. I wish I can eat more of it. The duck is really good too and tastes just like regular ducks. If you can choose only one I'd go with the pork. It's the show stopper.We did wait about 10 mins as the line in the front was long. There was two homeless people fighting on the street so that's a bit scary. The restaurant is small and only allows one group in each time. You order the food and pay and leave. We went to the park cross street and ate it on the park bench. Overall I'd love to eat this place again on our next trip.",0
"Hearing about Red Rooster is one of the famous restaurants of Harlem, my fiancé surprised me with a birthday brunch here! Our reservation was right when they opened. Although empty when we came in, it soon filled up within 20 minutes of opening, so I'm glad we had a reservation! Red Rooster is beautifully decorated and surrounded by the history and culture of Harlem. It perfectly harmonizes culture and history with modern elements, making this a beautiful restaurant. We kickstarted the birthday brunch with some complimentary dessert wine! it was incredibly delicious and smooth - somewhat strong and sweet, yet also thick like honey. We ended up ordering the deviled eggs, chicken and waffle, and the wings. The deviled eggs were a great start to our meal! I found it interesting how there were pickled veggies garnished on top of the deviled eggs. It definitely added to Red Rooster's unique touch! Although appetizer sized, the chicken and waffles as well as the wings were actually befitting for our meals! The chicken and waffle juxtaposed the sweet and savory flavor well! I remember the waffle came with a unique flavor for the butter. Although I don't remember the exact flavor, I remember it was kind of spicy and didn't match the chicken and waffle in my opinion. The chicken tasted deeply fried - deeply delicious. The wings were incredibly saucy and had a slight spicy kick to them! I think eating them by themselves could get repetitive but alternating between eating those and another dish would be very delicious! Overall, I am elated we had our opportunity to try out Red Rooster! Make sure to give this place a shot if in the NY area!",0
Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. Luckily we were able to be seated as we came at 5:30pm. We sat outside in their outdoor area which was pretty spacious. We ordered promptly - went for pan fried noodles along with some tofu and vegetable dishes. My favorite is the crispy tofu. It came nice and fresh. Ended ordering round two of the crispy tofu. I wanted to try the wonton mie but they didn't have any at the time that I went. The place is BYOB so once we ordered some of my friends went to buy some wine around the corner. Prices are decent and the food is good. The BYOB aspect is awesome. Great place to go to with large groups.,0
"My second reason for going to work is the breakfast burrito at Los Tacos No. 1.  Makes me almost wish I were going into the office today.  I've only tried the California breakfast burrito  (eggs, potatoes, bacon) but I am addicted!  Small burrito but at $6 is cheaper than the bigger one at Pretamanger.  I mixed the hot sauce they provided with some Kensington ketchup, which gives it a fresh tangy flavor.  Breakfast always requires ketchup.",0
"Love a place that allows dogs in the outside seating area! We came for lunch and enjoyed the deviled eggs, the pate, the burrata, fish tacos and the oysters (all solidly good, especially the tacos). I also appreciated our server for bringing my pup a bowl of water and a treat. :)",0
"Magical -- the real experience is so much better than the hype. The wait was short, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The quality of the food was amazing, and I especially enjoyed the flavorful broth. The only downside was that the egg was a bit too cooked for my taste, but overall it was a great experience. I definitely recommend trying out this restaurant if you're looking for a unique and luxurious dining experience!",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always great and the service is always top-notch. I've never had a bad experience here. However, I do have to say that it's been a while since I've been here, so I can't speak to the quality of their food now. That being said, I highly recommend checking out this spot if you're ever in the area.",1
"Stopped here because my friend and I thought the outside was decorated so beautifully.This is an asian/ mexican fusion place. In our opinion the food was over priced for what it was and not very well seasoned we shared the crab and lobster tacos. We also got the tuna crispy rice.For the money you can get a better meal somewhere else, but if you just want a pretty place to eat this is the one.",0
"I had a lovely time at Park Avenue Summer during Restaurant Week. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful, and the service was great. I ordered the Garden Mule, and it was delicious. The price is a bit steep for a cocktail, but it's definitely worth it. I also ordered the local burrata, heritage pork loin, and toasted coconut crème brulee. My pork was undercooked, but the waiter was very responsive and expedited me a new dish quickly. My boyfriend's steak was delicious. Regarding desserts, the coconut crème brulee was amazing - the macadamia nuts added a salty crunch that was delicious. My boyfriend's citrus dessert, however, was a bit weird tasting. I would love to return for the Autumn/Winter/Spring change-up to see how the décor and menu changes.",1
I had a great experience at Ted's Montana Grill! The waitstaff was friendly and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the buffalo chicken dip. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"I had a great time at Mala restaurant! The service was great and the portions were really good. The spice level was just right for me, and I loved the various items on the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",1
"I was so excited to go to Ichiran!  I have been to one of their Japanese locations and loved both the food and the experience.  I'm not sure what happened between that location and Ichiran Midtown; if it weren't for the distinct interior, I would've never known they were related.Ichiran is known for their single-stall, anonymous wait staff style.  I wish they had gone all out at this location and had the ordering process done through a machine, like in Japan.  But overall, I really like this style, especially when eating [messy] ramen.Tonkotsu RamenBroth: Not the most flavorful.  Thin.  Never in my life have I done this before, but I had to dump in some $1.50 vinegar to make the broth have some kind of flavor.Noodles: Sticky and over cooked.Chashu: Served cold, on a plate.  I couldn't quite get over the temperature, tbh.Egg [in shell]: Plain (no marinade) and over cooked.  Came with instructions on how to crack/peel it, which was cute and helpful.I do want to acknowledge that, based on the reviews, many other people like Ichiran Midtown.  Sometimes I wish I weren't so picky, so then I could enjoy amazing food all the time.  I also might have been overly harsh given I'd just had some of the best ramen EVER the night before.  Either way, Ichiran Midtown was a big disappointment for me, and I wish I'd had more time in NY to try another option.",0
"I miss Bubby's Highline. It was a great place for breakfast before and after the pandemic. Some of my favorite breakfast spots are now open later, but Bubby's kiosk with fresh breads, bagels and donuts is a great addition. The farm to table focus is also a draw for me.

The only downside is that the restaurant is very crowded on the weekends. But the attentive service makes up for it. I definitely recommend coming here on the weekends.",1
"I stopped in one Saturday for lunch and I was happy with my choice.  Service is fast, the facilities are clean.  I had their miso soup, which was on the good side of average as well as a spicy tuna roll.  It was also delicious and it was more than enough food.  I left satisfied and would definitely return to try other items.",0
"I finally made it out to Lola Taverna and I am so glad I did! The decor is absolutely beautiful and the flowers, lights, and island vibe really took me away. I got a table for one and didn't share my apps, because that's how I roll. The chicken gyro bao buns were so delicious - the actual buns were pillow soft with a hint of sweetness and the chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The moussaka is a definite must have and it was delicious and filling. The bechamel sauce was so silky smooth and delicious. However, it was a bit salty for me. I definitely plan on returning and trying their other items.",1
"Been craving Cuban food since my Miami trip last month. I was nervous that I'd have a hard time finding Cuban food in NYC so I was super excited when I saw there is a Sophie's Cuban Cuisine in my neighborhood!I finally managed to visit Sophie's Cuban Cuisine and I'm kinda glad I did? Lol. I got the same items I got in Miami - El Cubano and two empanadas, one chicken and one guava and cheese (because they didn't have beef in stock). The empanadas were good! I don't think I'd get the guava and cheese next time. It wasn't my favorite, but I still inhaled it haha. The chicken empanada was money. The Cuban sandwich wasn't bad, but it didn't remind me of the sandwich I got in Miami.Despite my review, I'm giving Sophie's a 5/5 Yelp stars because customer service was amazing. Everyone was helpful and polite. Also, the food wasn't terrible! Although it didn't 100% remind me of Miami, I wasn't gonna let my expectations bring down the rating because I still enjoyed my meal!",0
"I visited L'ADRESSE for dinner with my friends last night and we were very impressed! The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, and the view of Bryant Park is simply beautiful. We ordered appetizers and shared the mushroom flat bread and the pesto gnocchi. Both were absolutely delicious and I particularly liked the portion sizes - they weren't too big or too small, just perfect. For our main course, my friends each ordered different dishes and everyone was thoroughly pleased. My friend ordered the bouillabaisse and loved it - it was a very hearty and flavoursome dish. Finally, we shared the creme brulee and it was definitely a favourite among all of us. All in all, L'ADRESSE was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"So first off, I've been dying to come here since it opened and because it's Priyanka Chopra's restaurant-but it is so hard to get a reservation here! I finally was able to get one after downloading the Resy app. Anyway loved the ambiance and the music of this restaurant- it was very elegant and chic. The food is a bit on the pricier side, especially considering some of the portion sizes, as are the drinks so that's something to keep in mind. I would highly recommend getting the egg and cheese dosa as your entree. My friend got the green chili cheese toast which she said was delicious, but it came with one tiny piece of toast. If I got that, I would have been hungry within the hour. We also got the sona tasting board which was good but it didn't come with enough bread for the amount of chutney/dip they provided. We asked the waitress for a side of naan so we could finish the chutneys and she looked confused and said she wasn't sure it could be done- strange because I've always been able to order a side of naan at an Indian restaurant. Eventually the waitress brought the naan, but it was a struggle getting it to begin with. Lastly, the fire alarm went off while we were being seated and the waitresses just kind of ignored it while the customers all kinda looked around surprised, unsure of what to do. Luckily they didn't make us evacuate even though there could have been a fire in the kitchen and we didn't really get an explanation. Overall decent experience!",0
"I visited Joe's Home of Soup Dumplings for lunch and was not impressed. The Xiao Long Bao were ok, but the shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce and mixed vegetables were not my favorites. The dumplings are way too big, and I was disappointed that the mixed vegetables were in a brown sauce instead of white. The price is a bit overpriced, but overall I didn't enjoy my experience.",1
"Came here for the cauliflower, left here with kisses (Hershey's, that is).A friend and I were roaming around Chelsea Market when all of a sudden she informs me how much she's been wanting to try this cauliflower.  I was like.. ok?  Random.  We walk in and stand in line and I can already tell this place is a vibe.  The staff are all cheering to some accomplishment.  Tbh I think to myself how it must be fun working there.  We order our food and go to a table to wait.  Someone brings over a paper table cloth and our order comes out shortly.  AMAZING I tell you.  I now understand why she was hyping it up.  As we sit and chat, I see a staff member walking our way and offering us candy.  It happens to be Halloween weekend but I thought that was so sweet.  We will be back another time for more delicious food and unique pitas.",0
"Thank you to Avra for a wonderful birthday dinner for my mother in law and hubby! Our family was just blown away with all the deliciousness we ate and the wonderful hospitality of the staff. The romantic Greek ambiance was also a hit.The Zucchini Chips and Grilled Octopus were just perfection, definitely a must have at Avra. I also liked our other appetizers, Fried Calamari and Tuna Tartare. For our main course we all shared the Branzino and Fargi, and let me tell you it was just superb! The fish was cooked to perfection and the quality was just out of this world. So fresh and yummy and everyone truly enjoyed it. The presentation of the plating of the fish was a nice touch. I ordered the chicken for my son, so good that a 4 year old ate it all! The baklava was my favorite dessert we ordered. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal at Avra!",0
Not worth the hype. They're really really cheap but I can see why. It's all noodles and no fillings unless you get the dried shrimp or fish balls. Everything else is the size of cat food chewed up and spit out by a cat.,0
"Came here for a birthday dinner celebration and totally enjoyed my time here. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile  and though I was early I waited at the bar while having a drink for the rest to arrive. It was about 22 people at our table and I must say our waiter (can't remember his name but very funny, lots of jokes and he's from greece) was a gem. He handled our table well, attentive to everyone and made sure we were good. Our orders as well didnt take long to come to us bearing in mind our large numbers.I had the pan sauteed salmon with the couscous and radish. The salmon was done medium and tasted really good. The couscous was a different taste for my palette but after many bites I got accustomed. We also ordered garlic fries and omg I could've eaten that alone for dinner lol it tasted good and filling!All in all I had a wonderful time and 2oupd definitely be back!",0
"Absolutely loved stopping by this restaurant! Made a reservation via Resy for the restaurant but ended up arriving 40 minutes early my friend and I could just go to the speakasy portion of the restaurant. The staff member up in the front made a call & they were able to accommodate us, as it was still pretty early in the evening. We had another staff member guide us down to the speakasy and another person met us led us to our table. It was pretty empty except for maybe 5 other people, 2 of which were at the bar. The ambiance of the speakasy is absolutely *stunning*. I ordered the Midnight Garden drinks & the Fried Chicken sliders. I loooved my drink and the sliders surprised tasted absolutely amazing!! Was so so blown away by how good it was. Overall, service was also spectacular. As we were leaving, there was a gentleman around 7pm beginning to set up for his set at the piano I believe. So there is live music available later in the evening! Will have to come back & check that out. No complaints though about Bo Peep! Highly recommend you check it out if you're able to.Also, note: as of Sep 7 when I went, they had signs saying they'd check for vaccination status but neither my friend or I were asked for documentation.",0
Eh it was alright. Got the fresh mozz pizza. Pros is there is plenty of indoor/outdoor seating. I'd rather go to Joe's down the street next time.,0
Ordered lunch from here because wanted to eat some healthy food.Got the two proteins bowl (one chicken leg and one salmon). The taste is okay and the portion size is also good. The added charred avo is the most interesting part as the restaurant put some kind of sauce in the middle and it made it taste really refreshing.It's not bad of a place for lunch orders.,0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was fantastic and the food was even better. The karaage chicken was my favorite dish - it was so crispy and delicious. I also really enjoyed the ramen - it was very flavourful and had a great consistency. I will definitely be back soon!,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The Italian Thick hot chocolate was amazing - it was very rich and difficult to finish, but it was definitely worth it. The banana split waffle was also really good - it was very rich and caloric, but it was definitely a good dessert to share with someone else. The only downside is that it was a bit loud in the restaurant, and it was strange feeling being upstairs (it kind of felt like you were in a smoker's lounge). All in all, though, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Um.. what?  I ordered a Sandwich De Puerco Asado via mealpal on a Tuesday afternoon and I seriously did not get what was advertised/ pictured.  It's described as a ""Latin Hero with Roasted Pork Mixed with Tropical Guava and Tropical Cheese served with Fries and Greens"".  What I received was a hero roll with pulled roasted pork in the amount of a slice of deli ham with no cheese in it nor was it press-grilled, a few pieces of frisee, steak fries, and a container of sauce on the side.  No ketchup, and bar napkins.",0
A friend recommended the 2nd Avenue Deli so we went without doing any research on yelp or even looking at the menu. Big mistake. Once we sat and looked at the menu we walked out. The prices are astronomical! I cannot understand how they can get away with charging $25 for a lunch sandwich. Make it a platter for $8 more ... not sure what the platter entails but 33 for lunch seems like a lot!,0
"I had a really enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The decor is really cute and the servers are kind, which was really refreshing. The food was really tasty and had great seasoning. The only downside was that the pricing varied a lot - some of the options were affordable while the steak was a like twice the price of the other entrees. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
Ate here Saturday night as a group of 4 and wish I could have given it 5 stars! We had a reservation for 7pm but they still had us wait almost 15 minutes. The portions are small and prices high. We had the deviled eggs and burrata to start. They were both very tasty but gone within a few bites. We asked the waitress to bring bread 3 times and we never got it! It also took a ridiculously long time for us to get our entrees which was annoying. I heard great things for brunch but was underwhelmed with their dinner experience.,0
"I had a great time dining outdoors at Ricky's Restaurant! The servers were friendly and accommodating, and the restaurant went out of its way to practice social distancing in order to keep the customers safe. The menu features some delicious items, including crispy pig ears, black rice paella, and tostones. The portions were very generous, and I was very happy with the dessert - it was free as a birthday treat! I would definitely recommend Ricky's to anyone looking for a fun and unique dining experience.",1
"Ate here 2 nights in a row. The mutton.  Had the 'taste of mutton' which was a 10oz version of the bigger legendary chop I ate on night 2.  One night medium rare, the other medium.   Cooked perfect to the instructions.  The texture was similar to lamb, not like the mutton in Navajo country.  If you are accustomed to and like cuts of lamb with more fat that have the 'lamb' taste, like riblets, this chop is for you.  Forget mild flavors, I like my lamb to taste like lamb, my fish to taste fishy and my wild game to taste gamey.  Very historic building worth visiting just because.  The table was ready at the time, and our group of 3 was in and out in a little over an hour.  I like my fine dining like I do Confession: be brief, be blunt and be gone.  Bravo.",0
"I had a really great time at L'Artusi. The pasta is some of the best I've ever had - I especially loved the garlicky spaghetti and the bucatini with pancetta. The service was also great - the servers were knowledgeable about the food and wine and were very patient with us while we ate. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite crowded, so it was hard to get a reservation. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend L'Artusi to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
Came here on a Saturday night for the first time to meet a friend and it was a pretty cool bar and the vibe was pretty good overall.   Only gripe is that one of the waitresses picked up a handful of coats sitting on a stool and moved it elsewhere which ended up with me unable to find my jacket during the night.   Luckily they had it the next day,0
"I had a great experience at Harold's! The Market Bowl is a great way to get a variety of nutrients and flavors in one bite, and the cheddar and chive biscuits are amazing. The Mac and cheese was also delicious, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious lunch.",1
"Just ok. We ordered two types of BBQ meats -prime ribeye and short rib- , egg soufflé, and gyoza. First came the gyoza and it was still frozen at the center... we told the waitress and she quickly removed them off the table and replaced them. Just shocking that frozen gyoza were served in the first place! Meat was good, but not the best I have had from Korean BBQ... it lacked flavor and was not tender. The restaurant also forgot our rices. I will likely not be back because I think there are better Korean restaurant in this area.",0
"The restaurant itself is quite nice, with clean and modern decor. The waitstaff was attentive and polite. The food was good - I got the lobster and it was delicious, while my parents got the diver sole and the lamb chops which they both enjoyed. The prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic dinner. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I went to Pranzo Pizza & Pasta for lunch today and I was really undecided on what to order. I ended up ordering the chicken roll and it was really good! I would definitely recommend it to anyone else. The only downside is that it was a little overcooked, but that's probably because the oven was heating it up slowly. I also really liked the selection of pasta dishes here. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some good Italian food. It gets really busy around noon, so it might be a bit difficult to get a table.",1
The Lavaux is a great place to enjoy a quick drink before dinner. The wine was fabulous and the service was great. I would love to come back and enjoy some of the charcuterie and fondue.,1
We had gorgeous bites & sips on the outdoor terrace @thehornyramnyc in Midtown East!We ordered: 1 Double Smash Burger & Wedge Fries (WOW)2 M&M Pancake  3 Blistered Brussel Sprouts with toasted almonds 4 Buffalo Chicken Nachos5 DRINKS: Poison Ivy & Pina Fey Outdoor dining is open or order for pickup or delivery - support your local restaurants!,0
"I went to the Grange with my sorority sister who was visiting from New Jersey and a I went a couple of times before. I've had a pleasant experience both times! I really love the ambiance and vibe. It's very relaxed and if you actually wanted to have a conversation, you can come here. The food is sooo flavorful! There was even a live performance that last time I went. Not to mention it's very easy to find and conveniently located for those who live in the neighborhood. I believe it's within a 5-6 block radius from the train station. I'd definitely recommend when they open up again!",0
"I recently visited Sall Restaurant & Lounge for brunch and overall it was a pretty disappointing experience. The steak was tough and chewy and the fries were cold. The waffle was alright, but the whipped cream and blueberries were really good. The chicken tasted like it was from a bag and was overly salty. During the brunch party, the speakers continued to bleed relentlessly. The Saturday DJ was good after u ignored the ear torture, but the overall experience was not great. The service was impeccable, though.",1
"The server was nice, and the grits were great. However, it has been over an hour and fifteen and we have yet to be served our second dish or wine. The negative reviews on this site seem overly judgmental, but we are likely going to have to leave because it's taking so long. The grits were great though, and excellently flavored. Try the Wade Cellars Rose if you're into Rose.",1
"Flor de Mayo is always a must-go place for us when we're in New York. The lomo saltado, broiled pork chops and rotisserie chicken are all very juicy and delicious. The plantains are also quite good, but I think the Cuban places make them better. The waiters and owner are all friendly and welcoming, especially towards regular customers. We had a great experience on our most recent visit, and the warmth with which they accorded my Manhattanite brother and us visitors was enough to comfort our shivering Angeleno bodies not used to the cold.",1
"All in all, food = GREAT. Service = MEH. I came here with my mom and cousin Friday night before we attended a show at 8pm. We made a reservation for 6:30pm and two of us showed up at 6:15pm. It was annoying they would not seat us 15 minutes early because our full party (3 people) were not all there yet even though we were early. We told them we would order appetizers and drinks right away while we waited for the third person since we were seeing a show at 8pm and in a small rush but that didn't do anything. Their entry way is SUPER crowded. There are delivery boys coming in and out for takeout orders, while people try to check into reservations and others waiting at the bar all in the same area. The hosts seemed extremely overwhelmed.Once we got seated, we ordered drinks, appetizers and food immediately (as promised). Appetizers came out very quickly but our food took awhile (at least 30 minutes) so we were definitely rushed to eat even though we told our waiter our timeline he was not very accommodating. The food was amazing! I really liked all of the Thai dishes that we ordered and drinks were delicious too. We ordered spring rolls, dumplings, friend shrimp rice, grilled eggplant and equivalent to drunken noodle. Ambiance was super cute and decorative inside!",0
"I recently visited this sushi restaurant and thought the sushi was decent. I ordered the 3 maki lunch special which comes with miso soup and a salad. Considering the price, I thought everything was very reasonable. The sushi was a little on the bland side, but it was still good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some decent sushi at a decent price.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The drinks were delicious and the halloumi cheese was a real hit. The dip, meatballs, and zucchini fritters were okay, but I love how cute the garden seating is! The live music was really nice, and the service was great until I asked one of the waiters to take a selfie for me and my friend. My friend and I were straining our necks taking a selfie while a waiter was standing right in front of our table waiting to collect our plates, but the waiter refused and said he can't because he has gloves on. =\ Another waiter over heard, quickly intervened and offered to take a selfie for us. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely go back!",1
"The goat was decent, but the chicken salad was a little overpriced for the small portion size. The atmosphere was cozy and the service was friendly. Overall, it was a decent lunch experience.",1
"I got the tingly and spicy cumin lamb noodles dry. During dinner time, there was a pretty long line. After putting in our orders, our food was ready in just a few minutes.The dry cumin lamb noodles were packed with flavor. They're spicy and oily and the lamb was really tender. The lamb flavor was also cooked into the noodles. I liked how the noodles were soft and chewy, and it came in a good portion. One thing that was a little inconvenient was the noodles sticking together. This made it harder to eat since they'd be stuck in big thick clumps. Other than that, I really enjoyed them.",0
This restaurant is adorable and the staff are so friendly and supportive! The cauliflower is amazing and I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes.,1
"We LOVE dim sum, so any time we're in a big city, we always try to hunt down a good 7 day a week dim sum place. This time around, we tried Dim Sum Palace, and I'm glad we did.Overall, very solid dim sum place. They do all the basics totally well (barbecue pork, turnip cake, sticky rice, shrimp dumpling, etc, all exactly what you expect). Everything is made to order and served pretty hot (I think we only had one dish where I felt there was a temperature issue). The soup dumplings are good, and I would highly recommend trying the crab ones. That was probably my favorite dish that we ordered.Others in our party really enjoyed the pan fried tiny bun (we ordered a second one!), the crispy garlic spare ribs and the pan fried shrimp and chive. Honorable mention for the cucumbers and the dumplings in chili oil (everyone at the table loved those too).Service was generally fine with a few very small hiccups. Would definitely come back.",0
"Very convenient if you want a quick bite to eat and not splurge. The size of each roll is not huge but sufficient for snacking or a light lunch. We each ordered two to try the difference between the goat, lamb, beef & chicken. The four of us agreed the chicken tikka was our favorite. The naan wrap tends to be a bit greasy so grab extra napkins. If you can find seating in this tiny establishment, it would be your lucky day! The lassi is also delicious but on the pricy side for a small bottle at $5 when their wraps are only $7. They ran out of the honeydew so I tried both the strawberry (tastes just like a smoothie) and mango. It does add up in cost but I was full after the two wraps and lassis.",0
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant! The ambiance was really nice, and the outdoor seating was really nice and accommodating. The staff was really friendly and accommodating, and recommended some great dishes. My favorite was the Fusili, which was a lot larger and tastier than what I was expecting. I definitely recommend checking out this place!",1
"I came to this restaurant for lunch and was disappointed at how small the chicken quesadilla was for $10. If I spent 4 more dollars I could've gotten a burrito that would have been more filling. The quesadilla was still delicious, but I was just disappointed that it was comparable to a taco that's almost half its price. The service was okay but nothing stood out. If I come back I will go for the burrito.",1
This is my first back in NYC since Covid for breakfast and there are generally two guys that make breakfast. One who cooks on the stove and the other who helps with the other food requests. The guy who was cooking on the stove wore his mask but he would hand the food off to the other guy to give the customers. My issue is the guy who he hands it off too was wearing his mask under his nose. With everything going on ESPECIALLY if you are handling food. Mask need to be worn correctly. I will say however the employees were nice and the area seemed clean.,0
"MIGHTY Bowl is a fast, easy to get in and out restaurant with great service. However, I didn't enjoy my meal here. The shrimp were overcooked, the sauce was too overpowering, and the poached egg was very undercooked. I'm glad I didn't get food poisoning, but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I was craving a burger and decided to finally Au Cheval to see if it was worth all the hype. I was able to book a 6:30 reservation pretty easily for a Tuesday night. They charge a non refundable fee of 2.50 a person for a reservation which is a little strange to me but I guess this is a popular place so they can do that.We were seated at a cramped middle table near the entrance of the restaurant. The proximity of the tables was jarring considering the size of the restaurant. I hadn't dined in such close quarters since the beginning of covid. It took at least ten minutes for the waiter to get to us and get us water. We ordered immediately - I got the cheeseburger with egg and bacon and my fiancé got the regular cheeseburger. We also got a side of the fries with the garlic aioli.The food came out pretty fast. I liked my burger but it was quite heavy. I ended up eating about half of the burger and finishing up the fries - which I loved. The garlic aioli really complemented the fries. My fiancé didn't like his regular cheeseburger. He mentioned there was a Big Mac type sauce on the burger that he didn't care for.All in all, it was a good experience coming here. I wasn't impressed by the service and although I liked my burger, this isn't the type of place I need to come back to regularly. Probably would try another place the next time I want a burger. This place is worth trying at least once.",0
"I was not impressed with this restaurant. The margaritas were pre-made, and the shrimp was swimming in a pool of unpleasant oil. Meh, I'd skip this place.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The music was perfect and the staff was super friendly. The food was delicious and I left with a great buzz. I highly recommend this spot!,1
"I wish I could have rated Candle Cafe higher, but it lacked the flavor that would have bumped up my rating of the place. We started with the quesadilla which was alright, it was not as seasoned like you'd find it at a local Mexican restaurant, but this is a cafe serving it so there you go. Next, I had the Cajun sandwich which was lacking some depth, texture wise it was great, flavor wise it could have been spicier and had some kind of sauce in it to make it outstanding; It came with sweet potato fries and the portions for both were great. I also had a mimosa and it was good. This is an extension of Candle 79 which I absolutely love. When Candle West is back and running I will check it out, but I would not go out of my way to go back here and it really is out of the way for me so nope.",0
"Update: I missed the lunch by 10 minutes and had to pay $18 for the same amount of food as the lunch special! Take a look at the photo for the dinner portion and tell me it does not look like the lunch.Previous review:Hello Manhattan!  Ming is vaxxed and made to come back to work , but that means more reviews in this wonderful city.  I finally had the chance to try PF Chang's To Go.  One star off because not only did they not serve hot and sour soup as I had requested, they served no soup.  No soup for you!  But the spicy chicken bowl is wonderful and they put the white rice on the side at my request.  While the lunch bowl is a creation by restaurants trying to sell a convenient lunch to go, I prefer my rice on the side, like how I was raised to eat rice.  PF Chang is my kind of Chinese:  Americanized, just like me.  Actually, I'm from Taiwan, just want to put it out there due to all the weird things allegedly coming from China: Covid, bee-killing hornets, spam calls, bad IPOs, etc. etc.",0
"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. Aside from the cute signage, everything else about the restaurant just went extremely wrong. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen ($13) which was $0.33 ramen you can purchase at the supermarket topped with a sad limp cabbage and literally melt-in-your-mouth char siew (and not in a good way). The flavor of the char siew was indescribably gross. Reminisce of college school days when you living on a budget, but what angers me is that they charge me full price for a mediocre college meal. The pork cutlet with curry sauce ($10) was also a packaged item. Curry cubes you can purchase at the supermarket and not even the good kind of curry cubes with a poorly fried pork cutlet. Lastly, the bacon was terrible. The pork belly was overly dry and burnt making this dish entirely inedible. Needless to say, I would never be returning to this restaurant.",1
Order:- Filet Mignon (4/5)Pros:- Cute and aesthetically pleasing restaurant - Kind servers - Tasty food with great seasoning Cons:- Pricing varies. I feel like there were some affordable options and then the steak was a like twice the price of the other entrees. Overall: Cute restaurant in Hell's Kitchen with a great ambiance and tasty food,0
"Two Wheels is a great addition to the neighborhood, serving fresh, tasty dishes. I tried the chicken Vietnamese crepe and lemongrass chicken banh mi and they were both delicious. The crepe is kind of like a taco and comes with your choice of protein, bean sprouts, mesclun lettuce and herbs like cilantro. The amount of chicken was generous and it was well flavored. The banh mi sandwich was even better than the crepe. The baguette was very fresh, the daikon radish and carrots were nicely pickled, the chicken was piled high. There was also mayo, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeños on the sandwich. I'd definitely order it again. Two Wheels is definitely worth checking out!",1
"Came here for my birthday because we had a great time at their sister restaurant Kochi. But I was quite disappointed at Mari, from the service to food, nothing wows me. It really doesn't match the price tag. Reservation was easy just have to make reservation couple weeks in advance if you want chefs counter. I was greeted at the door and wished me happy birthday be seated right away. The whole tasting experience took 2 hrs. There are a long wait between each course, the handrolls took 5 seconds to eat but takes 10 mins for the next one. A lot of wait you will have to be really patient and not in a rush. I came to celebrate birthday they do not offer any celebration, no cake no drink no candle. Only just a ""happy birthday"" upon arrival. Nothing special spending birthday here.All the food are mediocre, a lot of them are just soy sauce marinated. The ""summer truffle"" they use is the size of the potato that I had never seen, but there's no fragrance at all. all the hand rolls are over powered by seaweed.",0
"Overall, I did not enjoy my experience at this restaurant. The ramen was bland and watery, and the service was not particularly good. The prices are also fairly standard for ramen, so it is not a particularly good value.",1
"We had an amazing meal at this restaurant! The chicken and waffles was especially delicious, and we loved the relaxed atmosphere. They even have wifi if you need to catch up on some work. Highly recommend!",1
"The rooftop at this restaurant is pretty standard, with a view of midtown. The drinks were okay, and I do have to say the fries were amazing. They were perfectly crispy and really delicious. The rooftop is a nice place to chill if you're looking for a standard rooftop experience, but nothing special.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The pizza was excellent - even better than I'd been expecting. The only downside was that the chicken on the pizza was really dry and didn't taste very good. But the other toppings were really good. I especially enjoyed the prosciutto with Parmesan. The service was also great. The waitress was a little preoccupied, but she was polite and accommodating. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and had a great time. The atmosphere is really cozy and the staff is very welcoming. The menu has a lot of variety, and everything we ordered was delicious. The highlight for me was the Unagi don set. The unagi was so fresh and juicy, and the soy and sweet sauce gave it the perfect balance. The nori was also a great touch. The tuna tataki was also excellent. It had a good amount of heat, and the cream sauce was a perfect complement. The fish was seared perfectly, and the textures were amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a great meal.",1
"Went in on a Monday for dinner, Place is very nice, white table clothes. I was dressed pretty casual but it was fine. It seems like every person here is your waiter. I ordered a beer and they brought me the wrong one but I drank it anyway, they did offer to correct it though. My beer glass was visible dirty so I needed a new glass. I ordered the chicken piccata with spaghetti as my side, I just wish I knew they were going to put red sauce on it instead of just adding it to my piccata plate. My mom got the filet Marsala and loved it. Would for sure go back!",0
"I had a great time at Lil Frankie's! The Spaghetti Limone was a fantastic dish - something I haven't had before, and I'm definitely going to have to come back to try it in person. The Mezzi Rigatoni Polpettini Ragu was also good, but nothing special. Overall, I thought the restaurant was great and would definitely recommend it. It's slightly above a 4 rating for me, but I think the quality of the food warrants it.",1
Finally a good Chinese place in the upper Eastside. We had a lot of dim sum which was all amazing. The big downside and a star off is the cost. Eight dollars for four small pea shoot dumplings! HK shumai was huge though.  The service was excellent. They even served us the first piece of soup dumplings. Cons: bbq ribs were burnt and dryCome here if you prefer to avoid going to Chinatown and don't mind paying more. Plus the service is better than any other Chinese restaurant!,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and there were a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. I especially loved the fish fillet and ramen. The broth was really spicy, which I love, and the tofu skin was also really good. I also really enjoyed the lamb and wood ear mushrooms. The only downside was that the ice cream was a little too sweet for my taste. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it.",1
We had a simple question and the bartender was incredibly rude and dismissive! There really is no reason to be so rude we want to give your establishment money!  The music is amazing and the vibe is here hence the two stars! There really isn't anyone seating folks so it's very confusing. It's also a cash establishment. The sangria was $10 and though yummy was served in a plastic cup. The wings were perfect and the fried catfish was delicious!! They do offer their patrons hookah which is rare in this area. The crowd is diverse but yet typical of Harlem. Their big screens displayed basketball games and the DJ was on point. Not a bad option in the area. The catfish strips will have me returning!,0
"The Meatballs Appetizer was amazing - the meat was very well-mixed and swimming in a delicious, fresh sauce. The Garogliani was also great - the sauce was flavorful and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The only downside was that the food wasn't as good as it was the last time I visited the restaurant - the bolognese I ordered was mostly just oily mess, rather than a delicious, savory meal. Still, overall a great experience - I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",1
"The food here is definitely good - the chicken burger was delicious, and I really enjoyed the fries with the burger sauce. The only downside was that my biscuit order never arrived, which was a bit of a letdown. The mini bottles of Diet Coke were a bit annoying, but overall I had a great experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"The service was great, and the food was delicious. I just wish that the online menu was updated, and that they made more of the new food. You know when you get your tastebuds ready? Went here because we wanted to try something on the online menu, only to find out it hadn't been updated. Then we sat w the new menus and got excited to try the mushroom lasagna, and both ordered it, only to find out they ran out - at 730pm :( I get during the pandemic places don't want to make food that will go to waste, but perhaps tell guests before they sit w the menu what's not available? It's low on veggie / pescatarian options, so the Chef was nice enough to make something, which was delicious. Maybe add more vegan, vegetarian and pescatarian options too? I'll come back to try the mushroom lasagna because it sounded delicious!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant recently and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. The rolls are still amazing as usual, but the food was just not as great as it had been in the past. The last time I visited, the burger I ordered was really cold, and that definitely didn't make for an enjoyable meal. Overall, I still recommend this spot for a quick and affordable lunch, but I'm just going to have to adjust my rating a bit to reflect my recent experiences.",1
The chicken potpie is really fully stuffed with chicken and very filling.Flavorwise - just eh.,0
"Chinatown always has to have soup dumplings on our visits, so we were excited to try Tiny Shanghai. The restaurant is small and specializes in soup dumplings and noodles. The soup dumplings can take 15-20 minutes to prepare, so be aware of that when ordering. The Fried Tiny Buns were good, but I've had better elsewhere. The Beef and Broccoli was tasty, but the dish contained minuscule amounts of beef. The Beef Lo Menu was very flavorful, and the soup dumplings were very good. I liked both the crab and shrimp and blank truffle and pork dishes we ordered. I'm not sure if the Truffle and Pork was worth the extra five bucks, but I'm glad I tried it. Overall, I thought the restaurant was good, but there are better options in Chinatown for Shanghai-style cuisine.",1
"Dallas BBQ is an infallibly good restaurant. The food is always delicious, the service is polite, and the decor is a bit on the funky side, but that just adds to the fun. The sticky wings are my favorite dish there, and I've never been disappointed with them. The Texas sized drinks are a nice touch, too. All other menu items are enjoyable, but they're not the focus of the restaurant. I highly recommend Dallas BBQ to anyone looking for a good time.",1
"Came here with coworkers late on a Thursday night- was surprised to see it was pretty packed at that time. We opted for bar seating and ordered from there.We ordered the crudo tasting to share, and I had the spaghetti alla chitarra.The crudo tasting was awesome, it was well priced and there was a little of everything to sample. In ours, we had the hamasa, fluke, salmon tartare and surf clam. The hamasa had a perfect firm texture with a nice balance of flavor from the chili. The fluke was very light, the delicate flavor contrasted well against the coconut flakes. The salmon tartare was well cut, and quite firm in a good way. There was a nice balance from the citrus and saltiness/crunch from the pork rinds. Super fresh. Finally the surf clam was very different- not too chewy and good heat from the chili. We split the summer lettuces salad, the dressing was light and fresh and I appreciated the array of baby gems. For my meal, the spaghetti was definitely fresh and well made. The pasta was good but the lemon balm/saffron combo may have been a bit overpowering for me. Would go for a different pasta dish next time.",0
"Enzo Bruni I'm no Pizza Aficionado but I thought this pizza was delicious. The combination of cheeses was so tasty. The bread was fresh out of the oven. I was so full I couldn't eat the crust. I shouldn't have eaten before I got there! I had the White Pizza. A slice is $5.45 with tax. The restaurant is going to be very very nice to sit inside. There's plenty of seating outside for now. The decor is upscale pizza restaurant. They don't have the kitchen open yet. I'm posting the full menu for future reference. Right now you can get pizza, salads, and sandwiches. The employees were very friendly and knowledgeable. They have three employees on duty today. I appeared to be their first customer. For today anyway! When I asked one employee the pizza ingredients there was no hesitation when he answered me. They're excited to be open. The hours are 11am to 11pm Seven Day's a week. I'm sure when I want a slice of pizza I'll return. It's across the street from my apartment building!",0
"I came here for dinner on a Wednesday night with friends. We ordered seafood ramen hotpot, tiger roll, wings, spicy pork rice dish, and roasted vegetables. Honestly had higher hopes of the food but this was a HUGE disappointment and I don't think I will be returning again. The portions were super small for a large price. Our tiger roll was $9 for 4 pieces which was really tiny for a $9 roll but it was good and I guess worth the price sort of. Next came the wings that came in 6 piece and the size of each wing was Like the size of chicken nuggets from McDonald even though it was flavorful but way too small. Then the spicy pork just tasted spicy with no flavor. The seafood ramen had clams and one shrimp but flavor was kind of bland and did not hit home for me. Roasted vegetables were way too salty and small for $9. Only things I enjoyed were the wings and tiger roll. I really had high hopes of this place considering this being my first time here but it doesn't seem like I will be returning.",0
"I was really excited to come to this restaurant based on the 4-star reviews, but I was sadly disappointed. The service was good, but the food left me wanting.

The Spaghetti & Clams dish was drowning in oil and lacked flavor. The Chicken Francese was overdone, there was too much butter and not enough wine sauce. Only the Frutti di Mare was solid with it's tomato sauce and seafood medley.

The Riesling was good, but the bread was subpar for a place where bread is plentiful. So, yeah, I'd probably pass on this restaurant next time.",1
"I cannot believe how accommodating this place is! I called at around 5 pm to get dinner reservations for 16 people for 6:30 pm and they said they were able to give us 3 tables next to each other, but then later called back to update me that the big round table was available for us. I wasn't a huge fan of the big round table because it only had 2 small grills, but the waiters that were serving us were super nice and efficient (they constantly refilled our waters without asking too!!). They grilled some of our meats on a different table to speed up the process. This was greatly appreciated, especially considering that more than half of the table consisted of hungry volleyball players that just finished a whole day tournament in the humid sun.

The AYCE kbbq itself was amazing! We basically ordered 2 of everything off the menu (and continued to order 2 of everything after the first round). Everyone was full within 2 hours. Thus, huge shoutout to the wonderful customer service there and quality food at a great price! This place more than exceeded my expectations.",1
"Came here for late brunch at 3:30. We were thinking of coming in the morning as a walk in, but was glad we didn't. The only time available after 3:30 and even when we arrived it was packed. Had waited for at least another 10 minutes to get seated. The outdoor seating was nice spaced out if you are concerned about being too close to other groups of people. I was disappointed that they didn't have a full brunch menu and wanted to try the egg sandwich when browsing pictures, so i opted to get the huevos rancheros. It was good, but wished it had more balance against the tomatoes. I didn't feel like it even had any and mostly consisted of beans compared to what I expected. Overall, it was still decent, but not necessarily worth the price.",0
"I absolutely love A1 Asian Fusion! The food is always great and the prices are unbeatable. I usually order from them for lunch, and the 3-roll lunch special is a great deal. Their sushi and Thai food is great and has a lot of vegetarian options. I even have done large catering orders more than once and the staff is always great and easy to work with. There aren't usually any issues, and if one does arise they fix it without me having to ask or get upset. I highly recommend A1 Asian Fusion to anyone looking for great Asian food!",1
"There are very few places that make me wish there was a zero-star option on Yelp. This place is one of those places. There are places with bad food prep, meager meat portions, and low-quality ingredients. This place seems to cover all those bases.I ordered a plate that is named ""Pollo Asado."" In Spanish, that means ""grilled chicken."" So naturally, I expected to get that when my food was delivered. Instead, I got something completely different.There was little-to-no actual chicken in my pollo asado plate. What little there was, looked like the skin or ligament of the chicken. The rest of the food looked like rubbish.This was so bad, that I called UberEats and told them how this place misrepresented its food. They offered me a refund, and from there, I ordered from a place that serves actual quality food.I will never order from here again. I hope for their sake that they improve their food, and stop misrepresenting what they offer.",0
"Los Tacos No 1 is the best place for authentic tacos in New York City! The plastic drink tubs with the ladle by the window are a great sign that the food will be good, and it was! We got three tacos: chicken, steak, and pork - all great! I have a bias towards chicken, so I definitely enjoyed those extra extra! The price was higher than I am used to in my hometown for tacos, however, it was reasonable for NYC prices.

It sure is true - NYC is the melting pot of different cultures and THE spot for good food! Will be going back to try the other locations as well, but this one was great! The only minus I have is that it could have been a little more clean on the inside. There was hand sanitizer around of course and masks required, but I wish that the tables were a bit more clean and such, considering the recent NYC covid outbreak!",1
"I came here with my friends for dinner on a Wednesday around 6:30pm. Wasn't too crowded and quickly got a table for 3 outdoors. Decent food and a relatively good price for the area. Wouldn't recommend eating in though as I didn't really like the dining area.



In terms of seating for COVID, there are a few tables outdoors with plastic barriers between the tables that are right next to each other. There was a small space between our table and the table next to ours (2 feet or so) without any plastic barrier between, which was a little alarming. The plants next to us also attracted an alarming number of flies, which was annoying as we were trying to eat. I ordered the drunken noodles with tofu while my friends got pho and the duck noodles. We also had a calamari appetizer to share. The calamari was amazing, with a wonderful crisp outside and great flavoring but was very small for its price. I think it'd be the perfect size for two people max (though I could easily finish one on my own). The drunken noodles were well flavored and the tofu was well cooked and coated in sauce while maintaining a juicy interior (which is actually harder to get than I'd expect). I",1
"I was really excited to try Olio e Piu based on the positive Yelp reviews, but unfortunately my experience was not as great as everyone else's. The atmosphere is really nice and the location is perfect, but the food was really disappointing. I had the chicken and pizza and both were really bad. The chicken was bland and the pizza was doughy and tasteless. The service was also really slow, which made the meal really frustrating. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great time at Lucky Cat! The food was fantastic, and the service was excellent. I would definitely come back.",1
"This is a prime example of old school Chinese food becoming trendy.I've grown up eating rice rolls coming from a Cantonese family. This place appeals to the millennial in me. The place is clean and the waiters are attentive (maybe too much so) and my water never went low for over a minute. After sitting down, we were not given much time to look over the menu before four waiters stopped to ask if we ordered yet. I finally just started rambling off menu items to get them off our back. It's a busy restaurant with a long line out the door, not a place you would sit and catch up.As for the food, the rice rolls were thin, the ingredients fresh and the food came quickly. We ordered four types of rice noodles and we could not pick up any of them with our chopsticks. They all fell apart. Not necessarily a bad thing, it speaks to how thin the rice rolls were. The shrimp and chives were nothing to write home about. The fish one was clearly frozen fish but still pretty good and cooked well. My favorite was the pork liver if you are a fan of liver I would definitely recommend.We also ordered one congee and would be the one I recommend which is the Lai Wan Congee. The peanuts were crisp, the ingredients were fresh and the taste was delicious. The congee is on the ticker side which is my personal preference .The rest of the congee was too simple for what you were paying in price. Our bill for three people came out to $53 with tip for 4 plates of rice noodles, one bowl of congee and two drinks. A bit on the pricey side but we did order a lot of food.",0
"We opted for the pizzas.Thin, very very thin. Good flavor and less carbs.There was a lot of pepperoni on the pepperoni pie and fresh basil on the margarita.They start at $12.50. The one thing I wish for is that they offer a ""build your own"" option.",0
"While planning my trip to NYC, I knew good thai food was a must for the trip. I was staying close to to the flatiron building so when I looked for close thai food, Thai Villa definitely stood out. I arrived with a part of 2 around 7pm on a Wednesday night and there was no wait. Like all NYC restaurants right now, you do need to show ID and a matching COVID vaccination card. The restaurant is deceptively large; it's long and there is a small upstairs section. It is designed beautifully and decorated wonderfully. The staff was attentive and quick. Once we were seated, we found the menu to be quick satisfactory. The drinks were good and the vibes were great. As someone not from NYC, I did think the prices here were high. The prices were comparable to other places in the area but I was still a bit shocked by them. We got the curry puffs as an appetizer; they were fine but cold on the inside. I shared the chicken pad thai, and trust me, it's enough to share. The taste was good, but I have to say, the smell was a bit off. So while the vibes were great, I can only give Thai Villa 3 stars because the food was just not super satisfying.",0
"A group of us ended up at Houston Hall when the two other spots we wanted to go were full/closed for a private event. We arrived around 5:30pm on a Thursday and it was semi-busy. We grabbed ourselves a table and placed an order for drinks. They do happy hour but it's just an OK deal. We also ordered some onion rings, a giant pretzel, and some HH sliders. The sliders are basically a rip off cause they're so small!! Other nibbles were good though. The place gets really really crowded as the night goes on and the sound is pretty loud. We eventually left around 7:30 because we were basically screaming at each other. It's a nice beer hall if you're looking for a HH spot to fit a large group but def not if you're looking for something more intimate.",0
"Jacob's Pickles waltzed into my life back in 2018 B.C. (Before Corona) at the Mac and Cheese Smackdown Expo in Brooklyn. I sampled their legendary Mac and Cheese and since then I have vowed to visit their brick and mortar location on the UWS. Today, I fulfilled that promise. According to their website, JP is doing outdoor seating by reservation only. Thankfully it's not too difficult to get a good time slot as we were able to book one less than 24 hours in advance. I assume they are doing take out and delivery too which are what most operational restaurants are doing now. Their menus are scannable QR codes as most establishments are doing at this time. The host informed us as we sat that they are doing a one hour limit per table. I guess turning over tables are more lucrative than bigger tabs from parties that linger after their meals are done (we got to stay a little over the one hour limit thankfully, I hate being rushed!). I thought about getting Mac and cheese, but I always tend to sway towards the breakfast side of brunch so I went with their Coop Platter. It was basically an array of different breakfast foods including eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries, grits and biscuits. It's the probably the best bang for your buck here. It was good, but not up to par with their infamous Mac and cheese. My friend had the veggie omelette which she had no complaints about either. We also ordered an Autumn Blush and a Honey Julep which were both boozy and enjoyable. The service was pretty prompt and consistent. Which I guess it has to be since they have a time constraint to abide by. I'll definitely come back to explore the dinner menu. Brunch was good but not amazing.",0
"I really like this restaurant's appearance and ambience - it has beautiful greenery and a very retro decorations. But I have to say the pizza itself is really not that good, it was pretty oily and it didn't have a lot of flavor. My friends and I shared four different pizzas and none of us were really that impressed.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was amazing and the servers were so friendly. They made me feel right at home. I got the pernil asado and it was amazing. The dish was so rich and delicious that I couldn't stop eating it. The portions were huge and I thought the price was a bit high, but it was worth it. I would definitely come back here.",1
"I never thought I'd find nasi kerabu outside of Kelantan, but here it is in Greenwich Village, so blue as to almost be neon, so blue that it'd make me suspicious of artificial colorings had I not seen the butterfly pea flowers used to color it with my own eyes (and tasted it with my own tongue). It is not unusual for Malaysian places to excel at fried chicken, and Rasa is no exception, either with the appetizer wings or on the massive slab adorning the blue rice. The assam fish stew is the first tamarind-based Malaysian soup I've ever really 'gotten' (yes, I've been to Penang, and they should have run me out of town for being so-so on their assam laksa).The salted egg shrimp is a delicious and salty take on fried shrimp, but it isn't really eggy/yolky enough to really remind me of some great versions of this dish. The best thing about it is eating the lettuce on which the shrimp's coating has rubbed off. Due to not looking as interesting as the other dishes, I got to eat most of this.A table favorite was the papaya salad with softshell crab - though the papaya was picked riper than it would normally be, probably to please sweet American palates.I was here with a big group, and so I know that they respectably execute the Thai parts of their menu, particularly their drunken noodles and basil eggplant.For dessert, I successfully convinced all 8 members of my family to try durian via Rasa's durian puffs - thanks guys! This only backed up my belief that loving durian is in my DNA, for not one of them had a reaction worse than '...it kind of tastes like feet at the beginning but it gets better' followed by another bite. A few even liked it. It made me wish Rasa stuffed more durian into their puffs, because really they were mostly fried dough with little dollops of fruit inside. (My family is lucky I didn't order the stink beans with sambal for taste-test time!)",0
"Overall, our experience at this restaurant was solid. The food is a 3, but the happy hour is definitely worth checking out - it's everyday from 4-7pm and has drinks/apps etc. Our waiter was a gem and let us quickly order a bunch of HH items, which was great. The nachos were the best thing we ordered, and we also ordered tacos, alambre (steak), Pescado (fish) and Pancita al pastor (pork belly - very fatty). Unfortunately, we weren't impressed with the tacos - 2 come per order and they're good to share, but they were just OK. We also felt everything was soggy, but that's because of the tortilla they use. However, the food overall was authentic and home made, and we would definitely hit up the happy hour again.",1
"The zucchini pancakes were a bit disappointing. The flavors were a little too strong for my taste, and the pancakes themselves were a bit dry. The bathroom, on the other hand, was really cute! It's like a bookcase that opens into a secret room, and it creates a really nice atmosphere.",1
"The E A K RAMEN NY Hell's Kitchen is a decent place to get a quick and cheap meal. The ramen is alright, but I found better ramen elsewhere for a cheaper price. The service is fast, and they have a couple tables outside if you want to enjoy some fresh air. The happy hour is also a good deal at $4 beers.",1
I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The staff was very welcoming and the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. I especially loved the freebies they gave me - tapas and sangria. I also really enjoyed the dessert they offered - it was really delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"Arrived to the expected line since we all couldn't get on the same page to preorder a pie. Took about 15-20 minutes for 5 slices. The clear star of what we ordered what the classic square pepperoni piece. Although tasty, the crust was a little more thick/doughy than I prefer, but I understand the appeal. The pepperoni itself was great and even had a little kick.  The vodka sauce slice was nothing to write home about and I wouldn't get it again. My friend said the margarita slice was good.",0
"Delicious and affordable jumbo meal during the covid-19 pandemic.  You order through a pick up/service window (or pick up from an online order) so there is minimal contact with others.  The staff is always super friendly; the woman who took my order sounded genuinely sorry when she said that they ran out of all meats except for the curry fish the first time I tried to order one night (about thirty minutes before they were going to close at 9pm).  I came by another day (earlier, around 7pm) and ordered the jumbo meal, which comes with three meats and three sides for $30 (though the price may be higher if you order online as opposed to ordering when you get to the window). Wait time to receive the food was about ten minutes.Got the jerk chicken, curry goat, and oxtail for the meats and mac n cheese, rasta pasta, and mixed veggies for the sides.  Everything was so full of flavor! How did they make the jerk chicken and rasta pasta have a kick without any visible pepper sauce?  Must have been the dry rub seasoning-- either way, so satisfying.  Even the mixed veggies (steamed cabbage, green beans, carrots) are tasty.  Would definitely recommend for take out, mon!",0
"I had a great experience ordering from this restaurant. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. I especially enjoyed the dal tadka, mint roti, malai kofta and butter chicken. I would definitely recommend this place for delivery.",1
"Ordered this for delivery on DoorDash and was appalled by the outcome. It looked like the pizza had been transported on its side because none of the toppings were on the pizza; all of it had slid to the side of the box.That aside, we ordered a supreme pizza with peppers. The crust was extremely soggy and there was an overload of peppers, which overwhelmed the entire flavor. The pepperoni slices were literally tasteless. Wouldn't order from here for delivery again.",0
"We enjoyed a delightful meal at LOX on Christmas Day, where we were trying to escape Christmas among our people.  We dined at the cafe and then saw a Yiddish play.  It was a memorable experience for our family.The menu in itself was incredible -- creative and inspired gourmet twists on Eastern European Jewish favorites. The food was delicious, presentation attractive and service excellent.The smoked fish and caviar dishes were of the highest quality.  I loved the buttery challah and delicate blini that came as accompaniments along with fresh vegetables and pickles.  My mom was still savoring her memory of how good whitefish salad was a week later, and my dad still dreaming about the delectable mon (poppyseed) pastry.  We tried chocolate babka for dessert as well and it was rich and flaky, a perfect rendition of the classic cake.  Unlike most Jewish delis, service was very good here.  They enthusiastically accommodated all our requests.  The waiter was a cutie.  There is no cocktail menu but they have a full bar.  I ordered a mojito and the chef himself brought out a gorgeous drink artfully arranged on an island of ice, with a generous extra serving that my dad enjoyed. A lovely lunch all in all.",0
Cho Dang Gol Korean Restaurant is a great place to go for a traditional Korean meal. The servers are friendly and the food is delicious. I especially love the cod roe omelet.,1
This restaurant is great for a cheap and authentic Mexican meal. The service is quick and the food is delicious. I ordered a steak taco and it was one of my favorite things I've ever eaten. The steak was incredibly flavorful and spicy. The chips and salsa were also a nice touch. I'll definitely be back!,1
Shoo Shoo was a great brunch spot! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really nice. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for some delicious food and a nice place to relax.,1
"Stopped by for a small lunch. Pizza came fast enough but service was a bit meh. I remembered that I couldn't even flag down the server because they were inside talking on the phone... on something that was not work related. I had to go inside to get the check. The pizza was ok. I also like to make pizza at home and I do use King Arthur flour for baking. If anything, the flavors were interesting enough for me to consider remaking it at home. Nothing impressive, would wish that the server was a bit more attentive since we were only there for less than an hour.",0
"The restaurant is trendy and has a modern design. The experience was fine. It's a bit expensive, but nothing special.",1
"We came here for lunch, but the downstairs dining area is right by the bar area, which looks very cool and grand. Definitely interested in checking that out in the future. It looks like a good option to take guests. The food was really good. We shared a tuna tartare appetizer, which was delicious... they had cut the tuna into small squares, and added different sauces and flavors, which went really well together. I would return for this alone. I also had the sea bass entree, which comes on a bed of spinach rissotto. Price was a little high, but not unreasonable given the venue. Everything was tasty, and I may have enjoyed the risotto even more than the bass!",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this ramen spot in Midtown NYC. The Classic Tonkotsu Ramen was delicious and the pricing includes the tax and tip, which was great. I really appreciated the set up - it was very different from what I am used to, but it was really convenient. The only downside was that there wasn't a lot of interaction with the staff, but the food was great.",1
"I tried to use the $20 off for Yelp check-in only to be told that it was no longer valid, despite being advertised on their Yelp page. Super sleazy and I can only imagine how bad the service would be in the restaurant. Avoid otherwise, be aware, they may try to rip you off.",1
Gotta say this was a pleasant find. After our visit to the natural history museum we jumped on the subway to little Italy for some food. Overall I was a little disappointed in the selection and the street personalities but the gentleman outside this restaurant had the most compelling pitch and he didn't disappoint.  The house wine was delightful but the buratta and the lasagna was truly delicious.,0
"I went to this restaurant for dinner and wasn't impressed. The pizza was average, but the combo special with two slices and a drink was good. It was a bit on the expensive side, but it was worth it.",1
"This is my second time coming around to Au Cheval (first time in Chicago a few years back) and I wanted to give it another try because I had a memorable experience the first time around. This place is much bigger than the Chicago restaurant, well lit and filled to a brim with people trying to eat a $30 burger (lol). Upscale dining with great selection of drinks and food with friendly service.Food / Drink:-Came solely for the burger which I did enjoy, but still am uncertain about how I feel spending $28 on a burger *without fries. The burger itself comes medium rare, cooked perfectly and juicy on the inside. Topped with the thickest cut bacon I've ever had on a burger and a fresh, warm bun. Egg is gooey as you'd want/expect. In all the burgers I've had, I wouldn't say it's the best but it's a solid 4/5 rating. Also note; the single burger is 2x patties and the double is 4x. -Fries - solid and served with garlic aioli.Long story short; absurd price for a good burger (but not the best).",0
"We were walking around china town and the outdoor seating on this street was very enticing, then we saw the best soup dumplings in the window and decided to eat here. We went with all apps and boy were they all amazing! Had the pork and the crab and pork soup dumplings, shrimp shu mai, pork buns and the duck spring rolls. My only regret not ordering more duck spring rolls. Very delicious, can't wait to eat hear again!",0
"Had a great, relaxing dinner for my babe's birthday. It was my first time watching a jazz band with a singer and it was enthralling. We got a round table near the stage. The food was nothing special (the portions were not bad) but the drinks that they make are great! They were very unique, fresh and they make an array of them, as well has having an impressive selection of liquor.The service did not hover-which I love. The Flatiron Room is definitely a place to sit back and enjoy some good music and cocktails and would be a wonderful idea for date night.",0
"They have a selection of Thai and Vietnamese food, which was interesting. Khao soi chicken- nothing special, I thought it was slightly bland. It was very creamy and I wish there was a little more kick to it. We got the dumplings and calamari appetizers to share, but the portions were very small. 4 of us had maybe a bite of each.",0
"This restaurant is amazing! The tuna tartare was so fresh and the sauce was amazing. The mussels were some of the best I've ever had. The bread was perfect to soak up the remaining sauce. The fries that came with it were also great and so crispy and salty. The green salad was so simple, but the dressing was amazing and refreshing. My husband got the lobster frites and the lobster was so flavorful with butter and garlic. I got the filet mignon steak frites and it was also really good, but not the best steak I've had. The drinks are also amazing. You have to get the espresso martini and my husband loved the old fashioned. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"S Wan Cafe offers efficiently-prepared, delicious Hong Kong-styled cuisine at affordable prices. We ordered curry fish ball rice noodles ($2.75), taro and chicken fried rice ($8), and eel spaghetti ($10.50). The rice noodles came in a large Chinese takeout soup container and were softer and more soup-like than the typical dim sum-like rice rolls. That said, the fish balls were still delectable. The taro and chicken fried rice sounds more interesting than it actually was; diced into small bits, the taste of each didn't stand out visually or flavor-wise. But it was still solid fried rice. Similarly, we weren't sure if the intriguing eel spaghetti would come with Chinese-styled noodles or truly Italian-styled pasta. It was the latter, with a tomato ketchup-based sauce. This might sound weird, but ketchup is used quite a bit in Hong Kong-styled cuisine (I've seen some sources that ketchup actually originates from Southeast Asian fish sauces and may derive from the Cantonese word ke-jiap or the Chinese Hokkien word ke-tsiap).I wish I had heeded the advice of a fellow Yelper to place the order by phone in advance. When I arrived, I naively thought that take-out would be quick, since there was only one other customer in the restaurant. Instead, we waited for 20 minutes as the phone ringed non-stop and others, clearly insiders, quickly picked up their order and paid in cash. That said, the space is clean, with pink walls and lots of plants at the front. Although there was no seating available, it was not altogether the most unpleasant place to wait and observe the traffic of local customers. Seeing the rave reviews for the Hong Kong-styled milk tea, we will have to return and try it.",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant for breakfast twice and both times the food was great. I ordered the ess-a-bagel with cream cheese and it was perfectly toasted. I also tried the Chia Seed Bowl which was creamy and just a touch of sweet. The Beauty Bowl (beet yogurt, honeycrisp apple, grapes, pistachio, bee pollen) is a stunning pink and it's light and refreshing. The Farm Egg Omelet (ny state cheddar and radical farm greens) was a bit underwhelming, but I wish there would have been more cheese. I thought the Grilled Carrot Banh Mi (cilantro, pickled daikon, jalapeño) had wonderful flavor, but the carrot kept slipping out of the bun and it was impossible to eat like a banh mi. I had to use my knife and fork. The service was friendly but on the slower side. The ambiance is very nice. We sat on one side one morning and then the opposite the next. Their patio does not open until 11am these days, but they kindly let us take a browse!",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The servers were very friendly and efficient. The ramen I ordered was good, but I found it lacking in vegetables - it was a bit bland. But the noodles were cooked perfectly. Overall, I had a great meal here.",1
"Ugh, I hate giving places like this 3 stars. I can tell the staff are trying but I think they have to restructure their food menu so this review is my feedback to them so they was can survive and get better. I think others have heard about the inconsistencies because I came on a Saturday night and they were not full even though they have a great location and ambiance. The good: the service was friendly and attentive. The ambiance is cute and trendy.The bad: the food is inconsistent and frankly lack luster. The sushi bombs are not good at all. The flavors were funky and the rice fell apart when picking it up. I think this restaurant should stop making sushi bombs and just make regular sushi. The only good dish we had were the toro hand rolls. Aside from the toro, I thought the fish quality wasn't that great which was surprising because l the head chef is Japanese and worked at some higher level Japanese restaurants.I was really disappointed by this place because I had been hoping for some good sushi and instead had a bleh meal with a $170 bill. I hope they can turn themselves around soon.",0
It was OK... The Cuban sandwich was different than any other I'd ever had. There was sweet pulled pork on it which would have been good on its own but odd in the Cubano. The French onion soup was really good and perfect on a cold night. The food wasn't memorable and we ended up just tossing the leftovers the next day. It's one of the few places that has indoor dining in the area and open late. It's an option if you want something other than fast food.,0
"I stopped by this restaurant yesterday and was really impressed! They enlarged the space and turned it from a quick counter and stool wing spot to a restaurant where you can actually eat-in. They even have 4 TVs throughout; one was playing a Halloween movie, the others were the News, ESPN, and NBC. This is awesome!

I was happy that the staff allowed me to taste a variety of their sauce before making a purchase. The INSANE was too hot for me. I got the inferno and smokey-bourbon instead. It was $14.99 for 10 traditional wings. I love the inferno. It was delicious. The smokey-bourbon was sweet and smokey. But the inferno was exciting and addicting and mouth-burning. I wish I ordered more of it. My only complain is I wish I had more wings and less drumsticks. And maybe also that I didn't like their blue cheese, it was too sour.

I used my own bottle of Roquefort blue cheese instead. Other reviews said their wings had too much sauce. Guess they've already made the change because mine didn't have enough sauce. Overall, I love the Inferno wings here and I'm already craving for more!",1
"I absolutely love Makana BBQ & Poke. While the food is very delicious, the restaurant's delivery services are unparalleled to other places in the area. In the two years that I have been ordering from Makana (primarily through Grubhub), the food always has arrived within or even before its delivery window. I primarily order the restaurant's poke bowls, sushi rolls, and tacos. I gotta say that I have not been disappointed with anything from Makana. *Hopefully, I am not jinxing myself.* Overall, the food prices are pretty reasonable; however, they have started adding a delivery fee, but this fee is not too aggressive. It's kind of interesting that this is a Hawaiian spot, and I have yet to order a Loco Moco. Maybe I'll order one from my next treat from Makana. Hopefully, this place will stick around for some time.",0
"There are two locations on the same block, however one is larger in size. The food quality should be about the same for both. When you walk-in it feels tropical and very trendy. I came in for my very first time through a mobile order on ritual. They have ample seating area for their patrons with free water too.  Ritual's having a deal for around 2 weeks where if you purchase something for full price the next time you can get something half off. So I decided to use it for this place which is right onthe same block and 3 minutes walking distance away. They had my order ready in a cute paper bag. I decided to eat in since there was open seating. I ordered off the menu 3 tacos + 1 side. One was the dumbo taco, the other was a beef short ribbed taco, and the last one was the rotisserie chicken taco. The dumbo taco is a plant based meat dish. I couldn't pick a favorite since I enjoyed all of it. The side that I chose was guacamole and chips. The chips were black and dry. Not sure if I would order that again. I would like to return in the near future if I didn't pay full price. I was very happy when I looked at my bill and it said $7 because of the promotion going on.",0
"Came here with my friend for a very quick early dinner on Saturday night. My friend was in a time crunch because she needed to catch her bus back to Boston, and the staff was very accomodating about it. We asked them which items would be the fastest to prepare and they gave us some recommendations, and the food came out very quickly. I got the spicy momil (cold buckwheat noodles) for $12 and my friend got the sashimi bibimbap for $21. Her bibimbap was more like a poke bowl but both dishes were good. There is a 10% discount if you pay cash. There was no wait at 4-5pm on Saturday.",0
"The Margherita Pizza was good, but the Kale Caesar salad was decent. The table bread was dry and tasteless. The Mussels in wine and garlic sauce was sub par. We asked for anchovies on the side and were charged an extra $3. We asked for extra pizza sauce in the pizza, but instead she gave us marinara sauce in the side. For $5! The service was poor and just okay food. We wouldn't return.",1
"We loved this vegan sushi spot right near Central Park! The chicken satay was our favorite by far. It was served nice and hot with a spicy peanut sauce that was delicious. The consistency of the ""meat"" was spot on. We would highly recommend! The ube Crunch Roll was also our favorite sushi roll. Came with a sweet sauce that paired perfectly with the ube crunch. The sushi had a wonderful flavor and bite to it. The Mighty Mushroom Roll was good, earthy mushroom flavors really came through but it was a little too much mushroom for me. The Sweet Tree Roll was also a big hit with my family as well. The Truffle Shiitake Mushroom Dumplings were disappointing. They came out fast but were served a little cold and quite frankly were a little bland - none of the chili came through and we had to request hot sauce on the side/dip the dumplings in soy sauce to add flavor. Overall, the meal was solid at 4 stars. It's a very bright, clean spot with fast service if you're looking for a healthy vegan meal before venturing into Central Park!",1
"I recently stopped coming to this restaurant because they no longer have their happy hour specials. However, the space is pretty good and the staff is not particularly friendly. I have heard that they host a lot of events here, so I might give it another shot in the future.",1
"This place had good reviews so I had high expectations. Maybe I just like my meat drier but the last 2 meats were disappointing. I got the Bussan Pancake which was highly recommended so it was pretty good. I got their pork belly kimchi stew too which was a good addition because I needed some soup.My friend and I got the marinated package which was marinated short rib, marinated NY strip, sirloin bulgogi and beef belly. The first 2 were pretty good and tender and they cleaned the plate between the 2 meats which was nice. Then they cooked the last 2 together with a beef broth. The beef belly first so that the fat could be used to cook the bulgogi. The beef belly stayed in the middle of the pan and the bulgogi was cooked in the broth on the outside which I thought was pretty cool. I don't know if he just turned off the fire too early or if it was meant to be but then bulgogi on the outside was just sitting in the broth afterwards. It might be a personal preference but I don't like my kbbq meats sitting in a broth. So my friend and I both ended up not even eating it. The waiters also stopped coming by to check up on us after the meats were done cooking so I couldnt get more water. I've heard good things about this place so maybe it's just my luck  this time.",0
"Upside Pizza is a small corner pizzeria with several locations in New York City. They do a version of the classic NYC slice, which is a small pie with a few different toppings. The location has a couple of tables outside that you can stand at, and the interior is quite small. A small variety of pies are on display, and two-man operation: one at the oven and one at the cashier. Got a plain slice from here. The crust was not too thin - equal balance of crunch and chew, actually. The cheese was smooth and blobs, and all came together for a solid slice eating experience. However, this place did not have a menu posted when I ate there and it's a bit strange. From what I could tell, people were being charged different amounts for the same kind of pizza. It's a bit weird. The slice was $4 including tip.",1
"The lights are amazing I had a great time. Seems a bit like a fire hazard to be honest. But the service is great they are extremely friendly. The mango lassi was amazing, as was the chicken Tikka masala. Has AC/Heat , good bathroom. It's definitely worth a trip",0
"The restaurant has good Yelp reviews and a tourist trap vibe. The waitstaff is very attentive and comes by frequently, which makes it difficult to enjoy the food or each other's company. The food is average, but the brunch deal is a good value.",1
"I came here for an early dinner with my girlfriend. We got the pork belly bun, nabe yaki udon, and tonkatsu curry. The waitress was very friendly and quick with service. The pork belly buns were SOOO good. I cant not get a pork bun if i see it on the menu. The udon came with two pieces of shrimp tempura, and then the rest was traditional udon. The noodles were thinner than im used to but it was good. Especially on a cold day like any other day of new york winter. The pork tonkatsu curry was filling and savory. I dont know if its the best ive ever had, its not, but it was very good.I enjoyed everything, maybe i was too hungry, but very good!",0
"I really wanted to like this place. The food is good, drinks are better, service is mehh. I came here with my boyfriend for date night. We had reservations made in advance and showed up on time. The entrance of the restaurant is not really the entrance. The host greets you but you are escorted to an elevator to take you up.When we walked in, the host told us that we had to wait 10 minutes. Then after 10 minutes, we were told that it would be another 10. We asked if we could sit at the bar or something. The host took a couple minutes and sent us up in the elevator to go to the actual restaurant. Once we got off the elevator, we go sit at the bar. The bar menu here was very unique. I got a honey comb drink and it had real honey comb in it. My boyfriend got the lavender drink and it was very pretty. We end up sitting at the bar for over one hour and there was no movement of having us getting seated at our table. We had to get the attention of many servers before we were seated. Once we were seated, it then took the server another 15 minutes to get to us. We were seated next to a couple who was coughing a lot so we asked to have our seats moved to the empty table near us. We waited another 20 minuets before we were able to order. Our server was very nice to us and very understanding of all the waiting that we had. He gave us complementary bread. We ordered the bone marrow, scallops, and tuna takaki. The tuna takaki was plated very pretty, but the quality of the fish was mediocre. The scallops had a nice foam sauce over it and seasoned well. The bone marrow was a little bland. The dessert was very cool. The golden egg over a soft custard was the best part of the meal.",0
"The mapo tofu at this restaurant was really authentic and tasty. I also really liked the pan fried dumplings. However, the quality of the frozen dumplings was a little disappointing. I think this restaurant has potential!",1
"Wowee Pokee!The ""wowee"" reaction is in terms of how quickly the base price went up to $17 for a poke bowl.  I'm not sure I knew that was coming but with some of the addons, this lunch unexpectedly added up quickly even for a large poke. Adding up would have been fine if I was wowed by my poke bowl, which I wasn't.  The upcharged Yellowtail cubes in particular had this off putting fishy smell texture that permeated throughout the bowl.I would have also preferred a little more feedback to some of my questions working through the topping stations.  I visited well before the lunch rush and it clearly wasn't busy as you can see from one of my pictures.",0
"The artichoke slice is still a delicious meal, but the quality of service and food has gone down a bit. The slice was served to me cold after being heated up, and the servers were trying to rush us out of there as quickly as possible. However, leaving a slice in the oven for a couple of minutes longer wouldn't really change much. Nevertheless, the slice was delicious and thick, and so large you can't finish it all on your own.",1
"I came here on a weekday evening and there was no wait, which was great. I showed up and was seated immediately outside. The place had a few people in it, but they had heaters above the tables. The QR code menu was really cool, and I ordered the khao soi. I wanted flat rice noodles, but the chef said he didn't want to do it. Um...okay? The khao soi came out a few minutes later, and it was delicious. It had a lot of fried tofu, but it was a bit dry (needs more sauce!). The curry flavor was deep, and the overall flavor was really good. The price was around $15 post-tax pre-tip, which I thought was reasonable. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here.",1
"We came in fairly late (~8:30pm) and were almost the only ones in the restaurant. Nonetheless, the server appeared irritated that we were only interested in ordering appetizers and desserts, as though we were holding a table coveted by parties who would order more. When the food did come, it was generally good, and I was a fan of the Tom Ka. The desserts, a banana dumpling and mango sticky rice, were ok. The mango sticky rice tasted a bit metallic. When I got home, though, I felt fairly ill and had a lot of consternation in my stomach, so...",0
"I went here for an early date dinner and food and service exceeded my expectations. This place specializes in Greek food with a heavier emphasis on seafood, and reservations are highly recommended although there is an above average amount of seating for a typical NYC restaurant. The ambience here is so aesthetic, and you can't go wrong with either indoor or outdoor seating, though we opted for indoor when we arrived. We shared a grilled octopus and lobster pasta. Grilled octopus is very chewy and fresh, with sweet fava contrasting the tangier onions and red peppers. It's hard to find places like this that can cook the octopus like this as most I have tried are usually overcooked.Lobster pasta was quite interesting. You get huge chunks of fresh lobster tossed in a bed of squid ink linguini, and the sauce is quite sweet and creamy to match the sweetness of the lobster. She likes sweet food so this was the perfect dish to conclude the meal. I personally enjoyed it, noting that the portions are way more than enough for 1, especially as this dish is a bit one dimensional in flavor - mostly just sweet. Service is great: they pushed the tables out for us to get seated and refilled our waters very frequently. Although we took our time eating and conversing, we were in and out in an hour just because they're so efficient in serving.",0
"Great value for when you're feeling cheap.The two for one pita deal is worth it.Not the biggest pita in the world, but like I said, gets the job done if you are hungry.The prices for the next extras like soda, water, etc, aren't bad.I'm happy.",0
"I'm a big fan of this restaurant. The food is always pretty good, and the prices are great. I usually order the grilled pork with rice or vermicelli, and I've never had a bad experience here. The banh mi is also not the best, but it's not bad either. All in all, I highly recommend this place.",1
"I had a disappointing experience at Totto Ramen. The soup was delicious, but the noodles were very sparse and the pork charsui piece was small. The overall price was quite high for the quantity and quality of the meal. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Beautiful interior. Exceptional food. Had the duck, pork buns, edamame dumplings, Broken Chili Chicken, short ribs, lobster fried rice, Asian green stir fry, tuna tartare spring rolls, and Kung pao monkfish. Was plenty for six. Downside was drinks had very little alcohol and filled to the top with ice. It's loud inside and dark, so take note.",0
"The food here is a bit mediocre, tasting quite a bit less seasoned than the ones I've had in Xi'an before but overall still capturing the essence of the food. The nice part is that most of the dishes were quite affordable, being under $10 a dish. Be aware that you'll be busing your own plates here as it is not quite a sit down restaurant.",0
"Came here for on the weekend for dinner before seeing a show. Overall had a pretty good experience, Quick service,  cool decor, But overall this spot was slightly underwhelming and felt very touristy. I'm giving it three out of five stars because there wasn't anything inherently bad about my experience but overall I would say the food was mediocre at best and the ambience was very touristy, with inflated prices to boot. I would say that if you are looking for a restaurant in the area because you are coming from out of town or about to see a show this isn't a bad spot to go if you don't have a ton of options, but if you're just craving a lobster roll, find the nearest Luke's lobster or go to one of the many amazing seafood restaurants in the city to find it.",0
"This is my restaurant week experience. For dinner, they are offering a 14 Oz New York strip steak with fries for the banging deal of $20.21! My boyfriend, his friend and I always wanted to try BLT so we thought this would be a great opportunity to. We ordered 3 medium rare steaks + fries easily on Seamless and waited about an hour for delivery. The meal came with bread and whipped butter, the bread reminded me of two huge cream puffs.When I ripped open the bread, the inside was FREEZING cold and the inside was raw!! My bf had eaten the bread and didn't know, so I pray pray pray he doesn't get sick! Be sure your bread is cooked before consuming!!!! Consuming raw dough can make you sick!!!! The steak had a beautiful color on the outside but once cut, it was all raw. So bloody I could hear it moo. We tried to recover this dinner by searing the steak on low heat which took an additional 20 minutes for all three steaks. Overall, the butter, fries and flavor of the steak was decent. But the raw dough, raw steak, and the effort to cook really made this a lackluster experience. I understand the difficulties to deliver a well cooked steak, but I wouldn't have been opposed to undercooked steak being delivered with additional instructions on HOW to cook the steak to preferability.... but at that point, why am I even ordering steak? Lol  I want to say this is due to covid restrictions.... but I don't know... it's not that difficult to bake bread thoroughly. The steak is forgivable but not the bread.",0
"I was really craving fish and chips, and kinda tired of the same old places in the city. It was a gamble and I won in the end. Oscar's was a cozy place that really could only fit a few but you didn't feel to crowded and you could enjoy the aromas of everyone's foods.I got of course the fish and chips plate and it comes with a perfect fish and lovely chips. The tarter sauce was pretty good as well. It hit the spot quiet well.",0
"Farm to Burger is a great place to go for a casual meal on a summer day. The service is great, and the food is tasty. The prices are fair, and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a tasty and affordable meal.",1
"I went to this restaurant for the second time and the customer service was really bad. I got there and my name wasn't on the list, so they had to call someone to get me a reservation. Then, when we got there, they forgot 3 of the dishes my table ordered. But the food was still solid. They are really short staffed during peak hours, so I would recommend calling ahead if you're going to go there.",1
"Adyar Ananda Bhavan is a hidden gem! I never even noticed this place in the neighborhood until someone recommended it, but now I'm planning on making it a weekly habit. The best part of the meal was the onion chili rava masala dosa. This is the semolina version of their dosa, and it comes with pieces of onion and chili embedded in a giant crisp sheet that takes up half the table. Hard to decide which of the four dips was my favorite. Possibly the coconut chutney.The rest of the meal didn't quite live up to the dosa, but I won't hold that against them. We got aloo chana (chickpea potato curry) that was good. The paratha was very forgettable. (Should have just gotten a second dosa instead!)The mumbai royal thali is excellent and includes two delicious curries. The vegetable biryani is good but not that memorable. The masala tea is delicious (not overly sweet). The badam milk was not my favorite.",0
"Came here for breakfast around 9:45am on a Saturday. We were seated right away. Love their breakfast menu. It is so cheap and cheerful as you can see from the menu. We ordered the stir fry noodles and also the steamed rice rolls. It came with coffee, although one can choose another drink.  All this was $5.25 and was enough to share between two people. There are other items I have not tried on the menu but will try to work through them over the year.",0
"The chocolate milkshake inside Chelsea Market was satisfactory. It was thick, tasted like chocolate, and there was a nice helping of fudge drizzled around the cup. However, I did not think it was particularly special. The price of $8+ was also satisfactory. I did not like the paper straw at first, but it did not crumble or dissolve like I expected.",1
"This place was quite good. I was very shocked because I have been seeing this place on Instagram. The pizza was quite good and it was perfectly cooked. I was concerned it would be burned or not taste good. We put different toppings and I must the toppings were quite good. The reason I took off one star was we had chicken mushrooms and arugula on the pizza. This was the only part of the pizza which was not good. The chicken had no taste and mushrooms were not flavorful neither. We had pepperoni which was quite good. The jalapeño were also good. One topping which I enjoyed very much was prosciutto with Parmesan. This was quite good and the prosciutto was quite fresh. We also ordered sparkling rose which I will say was good. The waitress was nice, a little preoccupied but she was very nice. The food was fresh and the service was good. I would definitely go back, they also have outdoor seating. I did want to try their spritz but I did not see anyone actually finish it. So I did not order it. I also want to try other things off their menu such as appetizers but to be honest we were so full. It was 7 of us and we ordered the 8 feet long and we had leftovers for two people. I took a video of the pizza but I am unable to upload it.",0
"I ordered take out for the crispy dough wrapped with steamed rice noodle ($5). The flavor was bland and oily (they gave tiny cups of soy sauce and sweet sauce) and the texture of the crispy dough was too hard. Enough people I know like this place that I would try something else, but there's way better in this heart of Chinatown!",1
Went in for lunch and ordered the wagyu beef French dip and fish and French fries. We wanted to sit outside but outside seating was only for people with reservations. Sandwich and French fries were pretty good!,0
"Restaurant Week review. It's a nice restaurant, and the staff is really friendly, but I didn't think that the restaurant week dinner seemed to be worth the money. Came on a Friday night and it was pretty lively. The weather was nice, so got to take advantage of the outdoor seating in the front. Restaurant Week meal consisted of 3 course. The shrimp appetizer was probably my favorite... 4 shrimp covered in apple, mint and some other garnishing. Selected the branzino for the main. It was cooked well, but it was a little too simple... came with a side of a handful of veggies, and some sauce. Dessert was the most underwhelming. I had higher expectations given that this is a French place, but both presentation and taste wise, it was fairly average... similar to what I would expect to find at a much cheaper place.",0
"The dj was really good and the drinks were strong, but the menu disappointed me a little. Nothing on the menu seemed worth the price, and even as I looked to my right and left the food didn't look that great. The bartenders were good though!",1
"I found this restaurant outside of the Chinatown area on East Broadway. The location is great - right off the F train station. The staff is friendly and the food is ok. I've only eaten here once, but I found the menu to be varied and there were plenty of dishes to choose from. The roast pig was good, soy sauce chicken was hit or miss, and beef chow fun has gotten pricey and bit oily. Everyone has different tastes so it's up to you to decide for yourself. The restrooms are located downstairs and for customers only.",1
"Hearty, Healthy and Affordable spot!Nosa showed Passion and Knowledge of the options.I will be back again, the food is good!",0
"I would've preferred that the smothered chicken be baked or slow'cooked in the gravy until it fell apart. My sides, greens and mac and cheese were perfect as were yams. Enjoy!",0
"Hummus Kitchen is a great restaurant for vegetarians and those looking for healthy choices. The wait staff is hit-or-miss, but the food is worth it. The babaganoush is some of the best I've ever had, and the falafel is also delicious. I would highly recommend Hummus Kitchen to anyone in the city.",1
Cute little rustic place. I ordered the omelette and it tasted excellent. I didn't need to add any salt or pepper. With the omelette you get a choice of a side salad or home fries. I choose the salad and it tasted fresh with a splash of olive oil. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. The omelette and the salad was quite filling. I love banana bread so I couldn't resist and had to try it out. It tasted like a real banana bread should. Crunchy walnuts on the crust and soft sweet banana bread on the inside. Restaurants like this that has been in business for a while knows how to really treat costumes and keep them coming back !,0
"My friend and I came to Sweet Chick around 10:30am on a Saturday.  They don't take reservations so we decided to try and beat the brunch crowd and were successful!  When we left around noon, the restaurant was busy.  The ambiance has a casual, laid-back feel and is a good place to grab food with friends.We ordered the Sweet Chick Waffle ($14) and Chicken and Waffles ($19).  The waffles were both the right texture and were sweet enough to stand alone without needing syrup.  The Sweet Chick Waffle had fruit, ricotta, and honey.  It was fine, but nothing special.  The chicken for the other dish was dry.  I know their thing is southern comfort food but this was more like bougie brunch.Service was great here!  Our waitress was bubbly, did a lot of check-backs, and refilled our waters.  Overall, I'd say this place delivers on your standard, overpriced, American brunch and is a safe choice but by no means a standout.",0
"Very chill and relaxed space. Good, strong coffee served here. Nice, open layout to sit and enjoy a sandwich or a latte with oat milk.",0
"After seeing a Broadway show, my daughter & I walked into Pera for apps&drinks before taking the train back home. The bartender,who's name I didn't get,is tending bar, seating the walk-ins,the whole package. We sat at the bar & ordered lavender Mojitos,&that was absolute perfection.Our apps...to die for..grilled artichoke beautifully plated, with green pea puree,like what? Sooooo good. Then the smoked eggplant with garlic yogurt served with pita chips, if I wasn't in a nice place I would've licked both plates.Our 2nd drink was a mild jalapeño margarita,that our lovely bartender made & let us taste to wow us, AND IT WORKED.I could've easily sat there with my kid for another hour, it was so cozy & pretty inside. A mediterranean gem, you won't be sorry",0
"I stopped by this place after spending a long day at the New York Public Library and I was pleasantly surprised! The kati rolls are great and reasonably priced, and the service was actually pretty good too - fast but not too pushy. The only downside is that they don't have indoor seating yet, but I'm sure that will change soon. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place as a great place to grab a snack - especially if you're looking for something affordable and tasty!",1
"Even with COVID, this restaurant has super long lines. We waited for about 20 mins for their signature cheap yummy roast pork over rice. I've come here a few years ago and remember it being amazing and wanted to relive that. The small roast pork rice comes with some cabbage as well. They pour seasoned soy sauce over the rice and meat so it is flavorful. One thing I did notice was that the rice was stuck together and mushy. I prefer rice cooked so that the grains are individual. If you're looking for a cheap lunch, this is the spot. But if you're willing to spend a few more dollars, you can definitely get better quality elsewhere.",0
"I still always drop by everytime I'm nearby, but after my last few visits I'm adjusting my overall rating. Although I still love the novelty and ease of the ordering system and the convenience of the price point, the excitement rooted in discovery may have enhanced my overall rating.The rolls are great and fresh, but nothing far beyond the norm. Additionally, the last two times i've ordered the cheeseburger in the Cheeseburger Hand Roll, the meat has been cold .- which makes it a very different experience. Imagine, a warm cheeseburger wrapped in rice. Now imagine a cold cheeseburger, cheese hardened wrapped in rice. Very different.Overall, still a great spot to grab a quick and reasonably priced lunch!",0
"Joe's pizza is definitely worth the hype! The service is fast and the prices are reasonable ($3 for a slice of cheese). I came here at like 1am pretty much every day I was in NY lol, easy and delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good slice of pizza.",1
"Virginia's is a great place to go for brunch! The service is friendly and the food is delicious. I especially enjoyed the ricotta toast, burger and fries. The ricotta toast is simple but the fresh ricotta and honey pair beautifully. The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy and comes with a side of pickles. The fries are worth ordering as they're thin, crisp and served with a delicious aioli sauce. The mint white chocolate mousse was also good. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit out of the way, but overall I would definitely recommend Virginia's!",1
"This place has the most flavored kimbap with a decent portion compared to many other places I've tried, including the rice. The kimbap is make to order so very fresh. I had the mushroom and tuna kimbap. Having eaten Kimbap from purple rice, woorijip, kimbap lab, this place is the most affordable yet best tasting and offers bigger portion.I wish they offer credit card payment and online delivery.",0
"TLDR:

The spaghetti at Tuscany is delicious - and so is their delivery service! I ordered during COVID pandemic times and my food still arrived fresh and delicious. The side of cauliflower romesco was a nice touch, and I would definitely pay full price for this meal. The chalets they've set up for outdoor dining are also a nice touch.",1
Wo Hop is a great restaurant for late night eats. The food is delicious and the service is top-notch. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good meal.,1
So I walk by this place a lot and was really wanted to try it.I got the galbi which was tasty by reviews are correct portions are small so I'm happy I ordered extra ban Chan.The soup that came with the meal and the meat were super tasty. I have to say it was marinated very well. But I hate how there was basically a bone with fat and then they put the 4 pieces of meat on top so it's deceiving when you are like ahh so much meat. So portion wise it's eh.Maybe I'll try this place dining in because people seem happier when they do that..My annoyance really started when I came in to get my meal and the guy handed me my food he basically pushed the open sharpie he was holding onto my hand.. like thanks.. it really wasn't busy I was basically the only one there..so I don't understand why he couldn't put it down or close it before giving me my food. So thank you for the great sharpie mark I I know it isn't a big deal but it's a lil annoying...,0
"I had lunch at Not Returning, but unfortunately it was not a good experience. The two ladies making dumplings in the window reminded me of the Dumpling House at 328 Spadina Ave, in Toronto - a must-go restaurant whenever I visited there. The decor is simple and neat, and I ordered a small portion of chive pork dumpling (App Mewl Mandoo). The skin was thick and the filling was too solid (packed, feeling dead), totally subpar. My adventure for a good dumpling place in New York continues.",1
"Very cool spot with speakeasy vibes and one of the best burgers in the city. Unfortunately, it seems they have long discontinued the Dungeness crab pot pie that Pete Wells had once waxed poetic about!Regardless, we still shared the famous burger (off-menu), beef fat fries, veal tartare, foie gras and chicken liver mousse cannoli, and Hemingway's chili. The fries were outstanding - you could definitely taste the aged beef fat, although $10 is definitely steep. The veal tartare and cannoli were both fun starters, and the seafood chili was loaded with flavor and balanced with creamy fat, thanks to the dollop of creme fraiche. However, the star of the night was definitely the burger.It took a while for our burger to come out (they timed it with the chili) so it came out room temp. Although the experience was slightly marred by the less than ideal temperature, the flavors were incredible! I loved the texture of the medium-rare patty. It was perfectly juicy while still maintaining a hearty, meaty consistency. The caramelized onions and bone marrow topping was indeed very rich, and tended to overshadow the taste of the patty - so burger purists, avoid. I really enjoyed myself though, and highly recommend Chumley's, even just for the burger. Would be a great place for a lowkey yet indulgent date night!",0
Was excited for it to reopen but a little underwhelmed by the brunch (did not do dinner). Portions were small and the bill was not. Service and art were great tho! Love the football mural and printing of the image on the toilet paper rolls.The downstairs bathroom feels like a vintage wine cellar too.,0
"After eyeing this place and seeing the great reviews, I decided to make a reservation and pop in for dinner on a Friday night. The decor was nice although seating is tight. We were seated next to 2 tables that had 3 diners each, making it a hassle to use the restroom when necessary.We got seated and got to ordering! I got the shoo shoo burger and the arayes. Sitting in anticipation as this would my first real meal of the day and boy...was I disappointed.The shoo shoo burger came out first. I ordered it medium rare. It was pink in the middle but still managed to be dry. Didn't think it was possible for the beef to be pink but still be dry. The bun was also hard in a bad way, didn't feel nor tasted good to eat with. The fries were ok, on the dry and over fried side. Burger patty was also a bit small. Overall, quite a let down as my hunger did not even help improve the taste one bit.The arayes was ok. The hummus wasn't bad, spicy with the green pepper but the meat had a weird taste and texture to it. Definitely not the typical lamb.Overall, this was quite the letdown. I came high expectations and left disappointed.",0
"I had a really fun time at Eaten by Steph, but I think it would be perfect for a big group. The service was a bit slow, but the food was just fine. The plates were small, but that was to be expected with a party of more than two people. The menu was a bit hard to navigate, but that's to be expected with a new restaurant. Overall, I think it's worth a visit, but I don't think I'd come back.",1
"I've been to the Smith several times and to several locations. The food is always great and so is the service. Nowadays, they are taking Covid precautions very seriously, requiring patrons to wear their mask when interacting with staff which may seem like a nuisance to some but I think it's necessary. I was in love with the mac and cheese. It's very creamy and has a great flavor. The cocktails are very refreshing as well. They have many tables indoors and outside but they're always packed so I highly recommend a reservation",0
"I visited Two Wheels for the first time and I was a little unsure of what to expect. The banh mi wrapping was really bad - the meats were literally laid out on top of the baguette with lots of cilantro. However, the good thing is that there's a lot of content and it tastes really good. I would definitely go back to the store to try something else.",1
"I used to love this place, but I'm not a fan of the way their pizza was prepared over the last few times I got it. The once delicious crust is now regularly burned... I've thrown big portions of it every time (at least 5-6 separate orders) I've got a pizza home from here. This is simply unacceptable. Their timing on takeout orders are way off. Every time I called to order a square pie, I got to the place and found myself waiting another 45 minutes. The first time I didn't mind, but this has happened every single time lately. No apologies... just attitude and the feeling I'm actually bothering them instead of bringing them business. The pizza is also saltier and the dough less chewy. Unfortunately, I have no reason to go back.",1
"I really wanted to give this place five stars, they did so many things right. However, the desserts and some menu items were not as good as expected. First off, the service was wonderful. My group was running a little late and they still accommodated us. They also didn't rush us out, the complete opposite happened, they told us to take our time. The waitress was very sweet, and offered many great drinks suggestions. Now to the food: the garlic bread was a little dry, but the Mac and cheese and French toast was delicious. And the most upsetting part was the dessert. We were looking forward to the layered confetti cake....... it's very pretty but that's it. The Oreo cake was moist but also nothing to call home about. Def a wonderful brunch spot, I would just skip dessert.",0
"Went here for brunch on Father's Day with my boyfriend. (We forgot it was Father's Day until we walked outside and saw millions of kids with their dads headed to brunch.) We assumed there was going to be an insanely long wait but it ended up being only about 10 minutes! The hostess was very sweet and so was our server. He was very attentive and courteous. I ordered the farmers omelette and replaced the sundried tomatoes with asparagus instead. It was EXCELLENT. the sour dough bread that came on the side was to die for as well. Loved it! My boyfriend got the lemon ricotta pancakes which he didn't love but I thought was very tasty! The things I didn't necessarily love about this restaurant was the atmosphere (felt very outdated ...) the cleanliness, (there was dirt in my mug when we sat down and crumbs on the table and seat...) and the price .... If the decor was more up to date and the place was a little more clean and bougie- I could understand paying $20 for an omelette-  but this was not it. I really liked the food but didn't think the overall experience was worth the price.",0
"The pizza at this restaurant is always popular, and for good reason. They have a wide variety of toppings and sauces to choose from, and the crust is always cooked to perfection. The line can be a bit long, but it moves quickly so you won't have to wait long.",1
"I came to this restaurant on a Thursday night and there was already a line out the door. However, because we were a party of two, we were able to get inside 2 minutes after lining up. They scan IDs as soon as you walk in, so it's very secure.

The food here is quite cheap, with cocktails and shots being the main focus. I ordered some shots and cocktails and they came out quickly. The drinks were decently strong.

Service can be spotty, with one waiter forgetting my salad and rice that came with my lemon chicken and having to ask another waiter for it. The lemon chicken was very sour, but the rice and fries were good.

I would definitely come back for cheap drinks and bar food.",1
"The seafood fanatic in me had a field day at this restaurant! The Tom Yum shrimp and crawfish combo was my favorite dish, and it was perfect for me - cooked to my liking without being rubbery. I wish we had been able to try more dishes on the menu, as I'm sure they would have been good. The atmosphere was cozy and the staff was friendly and welcoming. Overall, a great experience!",1
"I appreciate that they're open late, but the price point is high for the quality. 4 slices came to almost $15, and only one of those slices had protein (pepperoni). The crust on the plain and pepperoni slices was doughy and greasy, the vodka slice tasted like nothing. The grandma was the best but the cheese was definitely strange, sort of gummy. They have root beer in glass bottles though, always love seeing that.",0
I like this place for take out. The pho broth is pretty good and it's kept me cozy and full during the covid winter months. They do give sriracha if you ask for it.,0
"Ramen Setagaya was our stop after getting drinks at a nearby bar. The restaurant is cozy and small and there were some open chairs by the bar so we took them. The server promptly took our order (pork buns, ramens) and brought them out quickly enough.I was rather disappointed with the food and flavor of the ramen and overall preparation. I ordered a ramen which might  have been black garlic tonkotsu.  The pork / meat pieces  that came on the ramen were overcooked and had a weird texture.  The soup itself could have used more seasoning.  The pork bun was just an Ok nothing to rave about.With so many great ramen options in NYC I would not recommend wasting a meal at this spot.  Keep walking.",0
I was really happy to find this sushi delivery option! The sushi was fresh and definitely enjoyable. I also really enjoyed the shrimp Shumai. The delivery was quick and overall a great experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Nish Nush! The Falafel Trio Platter was a great way to sample different types of falafel and salad. The roasted pepper falafel was my favorite because it had a bit of a kick to it. The pita was also great, with a choice between white or whole wheat. The only downside was that the portions were a bit small.",1
"I went here before seeing a show and had such a lovely dinner. Our server was so personable, the espresso martini was yum, and the shareables were all great. Highly recommend.",0
"I stopped by Union Square Pitas for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! The pitas are fresh and the fries are a nice touch. The service isn't the best, but it's not bad either. It's mostly a spot to pick up takeout and head home.",1
"Tried this place for take out for the first time.  I work in the area and am always on the look out for good food at reasonable prices for lunch.  Since its specialty is Caribbean I had to have the oxtail with the rice and peas.  My first choice of collard greens was not available but the cabbage was a tasty but sweet substitute.  The oxtail had an adequate amount of browning, mandatory for Jamaican style oxtail.  It was sweet and savory all at the same time. I must've had at least 6 pieces of meaty oxtail but could only finish 3 pieces and 1/3 of the rice.  This small size only set me back $10 and since I can make a second meal with my leftovers, that's $5 for each lunch. There are interesting brunch items that I want to come back to try on the weekend when they're only available like shrimp and grits and salmon cakes.  The fried chicken is also a barometer of a good Harlem establishment because almost every eatery has their version.  That'll be my next lunch choice and maybe mac salad to see how it compares to my famous Hawaii recipe.  Glad Greedy Pot is here and serving my favorite hearty fare!",0
"Overall, our recent visit to this restaurant was okay. We stopped in around 10pm before catching a bus out of town, and there were plenty of seats outside so we got our food to go. Four slices and four drinks for $37 seemed like a far price considering how big the slices are.

Once we got our food, we realized the seats outside were now all taken by guests who didn't even belong to the restaurant. Having two children with us, we went back inside. There was no one at the bar so we sat our pizza down. We then got yelled at stating that we took our pizza to go and this was only for customers dining in. Which made no sense, since not only did I tip the person giving me the pizza, but I had also just ordered and tipped the bar tender before going outside. What was the point of sending us away, especially since the bar was empty?

Whatever.

The pizza was good, and a nice treat before getting back on the bus. The only thing that left a bad taste was the customer service. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, but I was over it. If we come back, we'll be going to a different location and probably sending someone in our",1
"Tapas in NYC always seems to be the first two options in Goldilocks and the Three Bears: too this, or too that, but never just right. Maybe I'm biased because I just had another fantastic tapas dinner in Madrid not too long ago, but I just find the NYC alternatives to never be very satisfying--which is strange, since many are helmed by Spanish chefs. But I digress...Huevos Rellenos - Organic deviled eggs, green tahini- Just okay. The tahini was a nice twistTortilla Española - classic egg & potato omelet- Sigh. Going to pull out the Spain card again. I had this for breakfast in Madrid not too long ago, and I swear I saw Jesus. This...this did not make me see anything but the calories I was consuming.Pan amb Tomaca - Garlic and tomato rubbed bread, sea salt, Catalan olive oil- Good. But it's hard to go wrong with this dishNuestras Bravas - Rough cut potatoes, spicy aioli- NahGambas al Ajillo - Garlic shrimp, ginger, jalapeño- Usually my favorite tapas dish. This one was...disappointing. Sigh",0
"I was so excited to eat dinner here, and Minetta lived up to the hype. My booth in the bar area was great for people watching. Even though some diners were dressed in suits, others in tshirts, everyone here seems important. The daily specials caught my eye, so we started with the grilled octopus. WOW, what a start! The best octopus I've had in a long time, maybe ever. The serving was small, but whet my appetite for entrees. Ended up being the highlight of the meal. Next I had the risotto off the specials. It came out piping hot, burned my tongue on the first bite. Incredibly decadent, the oxtail was savory, though the whole dish was a bit salty. The Black Label burger was somehow airy? It looks bigger than it is, but the flavors were otherworldly. I am curious to try the Minetta burger if I get the chance to come back. For dessert, the cheesecake. Not like other cheesecakes. It is more savory, cheesy, a little reminiscent of chevre. The sorbet on top was my favorite part! We spent as much on drinks as we did food, but you pay for the venue and the experience. Worth the pricetag for special occasions, or a Treat Yo Self day. I found it very difficult to converse with my date because of the noise level, so keep that in mind if you are soft spoken. Still, a fun adventure of a dinner!",0
"I've been going to this restaurant for years and it's always been one of my favorites. Located near the Canal Street stop, this restaurant is a gem in Little Italy. During my recent visit, I ordered mussels in red sauce as an appetizer, linguine vongole in white sauce and a spaghetti bolognese. They actually got the appetizer order wrong and gave clams in red sauce but it was pretty delicious. I was happy they made the mistake as I might have found a new go to dish!

The clams were perfectly cooked and had a very generous amount of garlic. (I love garlic!) The linguine with white sauce was good but not the best. It tasted a bit bland and needed more salt. The spaghetti bolognese was amazing and made up for the linguine. It might have been the best bolognese sauce I've ever tasted!

I would definitely recommend the bolognese!

This restaurant is the only restaurant where the bread basket does not go to waste. Their bread is always perfectly baked and warm. It is served with a side of the most addicting olive oil/cheese/pepper concoction. I have a really hard time staying away from",1
"We came here for our friend's birthday as he was craving for seafood. Reservation was very easy on opentable.

The service was great (thanks to Rachel, Vincent & Angus) and we got a bottle of wine on the house for the birthday celebration!

There were 5 of us and we ordered some appetizers to start - salted yolk dungeons crab (highly recommended), scallion pancake (homemade, very flaky), Oxtail tongue & tripe w/ chili sauce & wonton w/ spicy chili oil. All were delicious and not too spicy.

Given our group size, Vincent recommended Combo E as you get more seafood choices than Special Group Combo. We were also able to switch out shrimps in Combo E for crawfish. We went with spicy cajun flavoring as none of us enjoy numbing spicy (I know we are at a Sichuan restaurant). We all had a blast digging through our bag and licking every inch of the sauce covering the seafood.

We will return again- to try the sup king crab next!",1
I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and I was really impressed. The food was really good and it was very quick and easy service. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and easy lunch.,1
I had a amazing time at this restaurant! The servers were very accommodating and prompt and the mojito was solid. The food was amazing and the portions were huge! The duck was fantastic and I would definitely come back. It's a cute little place with really good food.,1
"Wayan is a great place to go for a romantic meal. The atmosphere is so beautiful and the food was amazing! The chicken satay was definitely my favorite dish and the eggplant balado was also very good. I would definitely recommend skipping the clams jimbaran and trying something else on the menu. The service was great and the waiters were very friendly. Overall, we had a great experience and we're looking forward to returning!",1
"Ichiran was on my list to visit in NYC, and they don't have Ichiran from where I live. It was our last day in NYC and visited this location, there was a line when we got there but moved quickly enough that we got ourselves a bowl before heading off to the airport. They do check id and vaccine card before seating down. There were 3 of us and we all got the classic tonkotsu with the recommended topping set.

The atmosphere was great, dividers from your seatmate which can also open up if you want. Water dispenser available for everyone, call button in front of you if you need anything, you can also order extra noodles but not extra broth. The service was great and fast. The taste? Amazing! The chashu was so tender and it was perfect with the broth which was creamy. Egg was cooked perfectly as well, a little runny as it should be.

Quick ramen spot that will leave you happy and full! I highly highly recommend visiting this Ichiran, or any of its location!",1
"Only tired their traditional banhmi. It was really good!  The bread was thin and flaky.  There was plenty of filling: pickled carrots and radish, cilantro, pate, ham and grilled pork.  Will definitely come back again!",0
"The burger at this restaurant is fantastic, but the prices are a bit high. The fries are also good, and a good portion for the price. However, I was very disappointed with the chicken wings. They were terrible, and I would not recommend them at all.",1
"Barn Joo is a great place for dinner and drinks! The food is delicious and the service is usually good, but the line can be long. The Truffle Fries and Wings in Garlic Soy are my favorite items on the menu, but I would also recommend the Sashimi Salad and Spicy Pork. The prices are a bit high, but it's worth it for the quality of the food. Overall, I highly recommend Barn Joo!",1
"I was a bit underwhelmed by Kuu in the UES. We came here for dinner on a weeknight. We were one of the few patrons that night. The place looks like it's more of a lunch vibe or takeout vibe. Bf got the Kuu chili ramen and I got miso pork ramen. The Miso Pork comes with two slices of pork belly with a soy sauce egg and veggies on the side. The pork belly was okay- had a pretty chart on the outside but that was pretty much it. The egg was cold which I was not really happy with. I also wasn't a huge fan of the arugula as a side garnish- it was an unexpected acidity and bitterness that didn't really add to the dish in any way. Overall, average ramen place.",0
"I'm a sucker for Xi'an Famous Foods, and I previously reviewed the restaurant in Flushing, which is the original one so I was excited to try the Midtown location. This restaurant is very close to the Empire State Building and gets a lot of foot traffic from tourists so I was a little weary that the quality of the food would go down. To my surprise, it didn't! I came here on a Sunday night around 7/8pm with a couple of friends (3). One of my friends order the Spicy Beef Noodles while my other friend and I both ordered the Spicy Lamb Noodle Soup. We were able to grab some of the last lamb dishes before they sold out!

When we got there around 8pm, most of their cold vegetable dishes were already sold out such as their spicy cucumber salad, which is a shame because that would be perfect as a side for the noodle soup. I would suggest if you have specific dishes you want to eat, to go here early. They also have slightly different items based on the restaurant location- so I wouldn't be surprised if your favorite side dish isn't at this one/or vice versa.

The Spicy Lamb Noodle Soup was delicious. Great",1
"I had a really great time at Jin Ramen. The ramen was delicious, and the service was great. The atmosphere was really cozy, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good ramen fix. The portion sizes were also really good, and the food came out really quickly. I would definitely come back!",1
"Updated review! Now including the Unagi don set and the tuna tataki. Unagi don set was massive! Included a giant fillet of unagi, which was marinated with the right amount of soy and sweet sauce. Perfect balance, juicy, and incredibly fresh piece of fish! I also love the ample amounts of nori the Unagi sat on, very umami indeed!Tuna tataki was also incredible. It had a decent amount of heat to it, and the cream sauce that came with it perfectly complemented the fish! The fish was seared nicely, with the centers being sashimi - exactly how i like it. The textures were incredible. Highly recomend!",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at Dun Huang. The noodles and soup were both delicious. I would love to come back for those! The lamb and rice dish was also very good. The only downside was the presentation of the food. It looked like leftover food that nobody wanted and the lamb was tough to chew. However, the kelp salad was very tasty. Overall, I had a great experience at Dun Huang and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"This has now become my go-to Indian food delivery place, specially during the week. It's a lot of food for relatively low $. I have enjoyed the dal tadka, mint roti, malai kofta and butter chicken. Highly recommended for delivery.",0
"10/25/19 - This was my first Cuban restaurant. I don't know the culture enough to say if it was authentic Cuban cuisine. I do feel however that something was missing. I thought my entree was a tad bit salty. The black beans was a simple side dish, but I enjoyed them. I wish the plantains were crispier.The staff was pleasant. Our food came out in a timely manner. The space is broad and the atmosphere is comfortable. Would I eat here again? YesHappy Eats",0
"We had dinner at Korean Express, thinking it might be a little cheap considering you order at the counter and take your food to the table. It wasn't exactly cheap, although the  service was good, something which has to be mentioned.

Rozena thought the MSG in the chicken curry was overwhelming. I can't say I could tell the difference between that the packaged Japanese curry we normally have. Not sure if that's a good thing. Probably not. The beef bibimbap is plentiful, with beef accompanied by an egg, loads of carrots and lettuce, bean sprouts and plenty of zucchini. It's a good dish, albeit unspectacular. Not a bad option if you are hungry but we have certainly had better elsewhere.",1
"King is the best Chinese restaurant in town by far! The pork and chive dumplings are fantastic - they're melt-in-your-mouth delicious! The only downside is that they're a bit pricey, but overall it's definitely worth a visit!",1
"It's sad seeing Mercado Little Spain so empty due to Covid-19 safety protocols.  We brought a lot of family and friends here in 2019 and early 2020 to sit at the bar, sip sangria and pop deconstructed molecular gastronomy olives or dine at Mar (miss their eggy white asparagus dish) or savor fresh out of the fryer warm churros dipped in rich chocolate.  But we've since been back twice seated inside the quiet mercado in October 2020 and March 2021, now positioned like a restaurant instead of a food hall and we still love this place.  Imagine being at Platea Madrid or the Mercado San Miguel, this place by celebrity chef Jose Andres transports you effortlessly to Spain.  The mussels in tomato sauce are the tastiest and plumpest in the city.  The garlic butter shrimp is still sizzling when it's brought to the table.  My husband practically licks the plate of octopus on creamy potato.  I can't wait to see Mercado Little Spain when all of the different food sections reopen and it's bustling with diners, but for now, the food is still wonderful and it feels very clean and safe to eat indoors.  You order everything through Toasttab on your phone and even pay the tab through the app.",0
"Every dish is amazing, especially all of the pastas. The lumache is their signature pasta, but the bucatini, tagliatelle, and pappardelle are all phenomenal. Can't wait to try more, and they have seasonal varieties as well. For non-pasta the mozzarella triangles were delicious (mozz sticks for adults). The grain salad is a nice refreshing accompaniment to all of the heavier dishes. And since we were there for brunch on a disgustingly humid and hot day, I had to go for the frose which was the best! Can't wait to come back here again!",0
"The flavors aren't super impressive, it's all pretty much one-note peppercorn oil. The noodles do have amazing texture that you won't find outside of Chinatown/Flushing.",0
"New spot where the short-lived Banty Rooster was. It's a short menu of apps, pastas, mains, etc., and everything we tried was delicious.Get the Focaccia ($9) and the Crudo to start, both were exceptionally good. We tried both pastas too, which were great, especially the Pappardelle. For dessert, try the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart.",0
"I absolutely love this place! I've only ever ordered it off Seamless and it gets delivered so quickly and the best part is how large the portion is. I can easily make this into 3 meals because it comes with rice. There's also an option for the Mughlai special which is perfect if you want to try a few different items it includes 1 appetizer (smaller than if you got it normally), 1 entree (smaller than if you got it normally), rice, naan (massive!), mango chutney & raita (comes in small little plastic containers). I've tried the saag paneer and malai kofta and both have been great, the saag paneer was better though. The malai kofta is definitely very heavy on the cream, but still good on the flavor.

I've ordered from this place 3 times already and i've been very happy every single time. This is definitely has become my go-to indian place for delivery!",1
I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. The dim sum was below average and the service was confused. I would not recommend it.,1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The pasta was perfect and the portion size was just right. I especially loved the fettuccine tartufo with a generous amount of truffle shavings. The only complaint I had was that the sauce in both pastas were a bit too salty for my taste. The chocolate cake with vanilla gelato was also a great dessert. I will definitely be back!,1
"Jongro is a NY KBBQ restaurant that is definitely worth considering if you're looking for an authentic Korean BBQ experience. The banchan, kimchi pancake, and meats all tasted great, and the service was always prompt and friendly. The only downside was that the restaurant wasn't quite as AYCE-y as I would have liked it to be, but overall it was a great experience.",1
"Jiang Diner is a restaurant I always enjoy visiting. The food is always delicious and the staff is always welcoming. The only downside to this visit was that service was slow. Despite this, the food was still very good. The lamb kidneys were a bit overdone, but the hand rolled noodles and cumin beef were both cooked well. The big plate chicken was underseasoned, but the portions were still large. Overall, I had a great time at Jiang Diner and would definitely recommend it.",1
"We stopped by this cute little restaurant for brunch on a Sunday and we were both very impressed! His coffee and my chai were both really good. I got the Butcher's Bowl and it was really filling and delicious. The harissa aioli was my favorite part, it was so good. I can't wait to come back and try something else!",1
"BEWARE.You have been warned. This place has HORRIBLY ""trained"" staff; this is a reflection of horrible management. I placed an order on the phone and when it arrived, I realized that it was incorrect. I called Grito to report this. I was told that I had to give back the incorrect CHEAPER order; they made it seem like I was trying to keep a free order. Like girl, get your life together. I am just trying to get the order that I paid for. Stop sending people less than what they paid for. So whatever... that happens.A few minutes later, I was called back from a girl at Grito to my personal phone number; I was harrassed, called a liar and asked if I do not listen. This little NOBODY thought that she was gonna call me and belittle me.I called back and she was calmer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke to a Leslie?? Leslie stated that she was the manager and that she was aware of the incident and everything I stated on my prior paragraph. Leslie told me that she told the NOBODY that called me that she should not have called me back and that she understands that her actions were unprofessional. If I were running a business, and an employee was harassing customers, I would NOT tolerate that and I would have sent that person home... harrassment is not good for business.Then, Leslie told me that my order is being prepared and, again, told me to return the incorrect order. Like excuse me? Do not knock on my door. Do not send me anything. Keep the extra money. I do not want anything from this place, after what I experienced... For all I know, they were going to spit in my food, just for trying to get what I paid for.** Oh, and from reading other reviews, I can see that the customer service here LACKS.",0
"Yum! Everything was amazing except for the unagi at the end! The unagi here was not my favorite because they gave us crushed up barbecue eel on top of rice. I was really disappointed because eel is usually my favorite sushi. I really wish they gave a slice of unagi instead of crushed up pieces... I would LOVE this place and continuously go back if they did. Besides the issue with the unagi, I think my favorite pieces from this omakase was the sweet shrimp and wagyu with uni. The omakase meal was worth $65 for 12 pieces.",0
"While the hostess was super friendly and offered more service than any other waitstaff, this restaurant was a total fail. The food was mediocre at best, and the drinks never came. The waitstaff was unorganized and didn't seem to care about their customers. I would never return to this restaurant.",1
"Overall, food is quite good but overpriced for sure.Ssam platter: 4/5 spicy pork butt/gochuchang wrap/sticky rice. good but nothing really stands out and the price is quite high, u can probably get quite similar things at other Korean bbq places at a cheaper price. Oiji bowl: 4/5 sea urchin/sweet shrimp on seasoned rice and pickled vegetable. Tasted good but overpriced. Small portion. Great presentation. Not sure if I would pay this 36 dollars again for this though.Waygu beef: 4/5 I couldn't taste these very thin slices of beef in the overwhelming amount of sauce. Although the sauce tasted good with the egg and torch cooking was interesting. I would never pay another 36 dollars again for this. Too overpriced for the beef that didn't stand out.",0
"We came here on a weekend with reservations and were seated right away. The inside looks very nice and the aesthetic of the whole place is cool. We started with drinks and the pizou pizou pizou which is supposed to be like a pisco sour was a table favorite. There was another drink that tasted like popcorn which was interesting. There's a pre fixe menu but whole table has to do, we went with ordering separate items. We got both the ceviches, we were split on which we liked more. Personally I loved the scallops. The tuna was good, comes with 4 pieces but since there was 5 of us they gave additional piece. Then tofu and shrimp was excellent, really loved the yellow sauce which was a little spicy!For mains we got the Iberio pork with pesto udon noodle and chicken thigh. I was disappointed in the chicken thigh, everyone at the table absolutely loved the pork. Noodles were good.Overall, really enjoyed our experience here. Got to try a lot of new flavors which did work. Also, the service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and really helped us select both drinks and dishes.",0
"I visited this restaurant twice and both times the food was great. It's a decent size restaurant with many different sake options, and the service was good both times. It's definitely a more Japanese-style restaurant, which I liked. The Ahi tower was full of flavors and the Salmon Osaka was really tender and delicious. The Hamachi Kama was also really good - it was grilled perfectly and had a great taste. The quality of the sushi was better than most of the restaurants around, but you do pay a bit more for it. Overall, I had a great experience here and I would definitely recommend it!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The dim sum was delicious and fresh. It was pretty chaotic, but that's what makes it fun. The only downside was that some of the dishes were served lukewarm and the cruller with rice roll was really cold. But overall, it was a great experience.",1
"The vibes here are like a 5' 3"" girl with 6 ft energy. Small cozy place with not a ton of seating but they fill up all the space with their neat decor, neon lights, and club-like music. In general the food and drinks are solid. Their version of konchizeu (corn cheese) is a lil diff from your typical korean corn cheese. It reminds me of mexican elote with their spices and use of cojita cheese with a lime wedge to top off corn baked into something like a slice of bread. The saamgyubkocci was a bit tougher of the pork bellies so if you like soft tender textures, def go with the bossam.",0
"I had a great time at Lazarra's Pizza. The pizza was just as I remembered it - saucy, flavorful, and a delicious crust. It's different from other pizza you'll get in NYC, but so good. The service was great, too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",1
"So happy that Fieldtrip opened up this new Midtown outpost from Harlem. It's a fast casual restaurant that specializes in rice bowls, and the rice are all unbleached and not enriched. The BBQ Brisket was spicier than I expected, with small red chili slices, chipotle black beans, brown rice, and hoisin sauce. It was so consistently flavored that even the rice at the bottom was well-seasoned! I tried my friend's Crispy Chicken, which featured Carolina Gold fried rice and fried chicken chunks, but I preferred mine. I've previously had the Shrimp bowl and Quinoa Bao Buns, which are both worth trying out as well!",0
"The Cecil has great food and amazing staff. They were super friendly and welcoming. The DJ made it all the more special though, with a great playlist and vibes. The outdoor seats were real comfortable and the dibi with fried plantains and rice might be the star of the show.",0
"I visited this restaurant for lunch and overall it was a good experience. I got the house special beef soup and it was good. It's a bit expensive for the area, but the meat they give you is a lot and it was well executed. The only downside is that I was hoping for more flavor overall and more chew to the noodles. The seating is limited, but they do take cards.",1
"This is always on my list to go to whenever I visit NYC. Honestly, I'd still come back, always! Even though this most recent time I went, my favorite dish was not cooked up to par (Prawn Karee, shrimp was definitely over cooked where the meat tasted like frozen prawn and soggy, not what I'd expect in a $28-30 dollar dish with only prawns that should be the key and most important part to cook carefully). Other than that, everything else was good as usual, especially happy hour oysters Have to get side of rice with this dish , it is a must if you want to enjoy the karee/scrambled egg with something like rice to help balance out the tastes well :)",0
"Pig and Khao has a limited menu, but we enjoyed everything we ordered! Ordering family style is definitely the way to go. Of what we ordered, the Brussel Sprouts and the Papaya Salad (super refreshing) were my favorite. The service was also wonderful. Would recommend stopping by if you're in the mood for some good Asian fusion food!",0
I had a great experience at Tang restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was very good. The portions were large and the flavors were authentic. I was very happy with the experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The food was not too expensive and tasted similar to other Spanish food I've had before. I was disappointed that the chicken I ordered was not cooked properly - it was almost raw. However, the beans and rice were good. I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I definitely recommend visiting Bareburger if you're in the area and craving a delicious burger! The burgers are definitely higher quality than what you'll find at most fast food chains, and the grilled onions and cheese are a great addition. I didn't even need the ketchup or mustard, but they were both included in my meal so I could enjoy them fully. The wait time was minimal, and the food was delivered right to my door. I can't wait to come back!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a casual night out in the city.",1
"I had a great time at this ramen restaurant! The value was unbeatable and the service was top-notch. Our ramen bowls were both delicious - the chili chicken ramen had a lot of flavor and the pork ramen was cooked to perfection. The only downside was that the noodles were a bit too spicy for my taste, but the waitress was very accommodating and replaced the bowl without charging us. Thank you for a great dining experience!",1
"I really enjoy this place for its delicious Thai food. The service is always quick and the food is fresh. I especially love their papaya salad, which is a great way to get a healthy balance of nutrients. The only downside is that the curries can be a little too watery for my taste, but overall I'm very happy with this restaurant.",1
"This is the Thai restaurant I would like to come back regular basis. I loved loved loved uncle boon's crab fried rice and Laab with fried chicken.Laab salad was perfect with the balance of mints, green, crunchy fried chicken :)",0
I mostly go here for convenience since it's near my office.  The service here is okay.  We didn't get bread before our entrees like other tables and their wasn't communication between the server and the person serving.  I got the Serafina chicken salad which was okay.  It was a good portion for lunch but the pesto lacked flavor.  The only flavor came in bites with sun dried tomatoes.,0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good. The prices are a little on the high side, but it's worth it in my opinion. I also thought the service was excellent. The only downside is that the restaurant was quite noisy, making it difficult to have a conversation.",1
"This review is for my dim sum experience here. When your MIL chooses a restaurant for a CNY family gathering, you don't argue. You just go with the flow even when you have a list of new restaurants in the area you want to try on your Yelp list. My MIL comes here often and knows the entire staff. We had to occupy two large tables. Being the thin one, I was squished against the wall. Every time the dim sum cart came by I had to stand up to see all the goodies and shout across the table to tell them what I wanted. A bit frustrating at times. The restaurant is massive and chaotic. One can hardly have a conversation without screaming. This is the true dim sum experience. I usually have high exceptions when it comes to dim sum. Here are a few misses for me.- Some of the dishes were served lukewarm- The fried cruller w/rice roll was hard and cold- the skin on the rice rolls could have been a bit thicker- not enough varieties (same items kept coming around)It was hard to take any pics. Have your chopstick skills on, you slow you lose. We had one bill for the two tables. When you are done, you flag a waiter down and they will calculate the bill with tax in front of you. That always impresses me. This time, the waiter had to walk away and bust out his calculator. We ordered quite a bit. All in all a decent meal here. Would I come back? Only if my MIL says I have to.",0
"I don't remember how we found this sushi place but it was for my birthday dinner. We booked the sit down for omakase course at the counter. Watching the master making sushi while eating them was very enjoyable and fun. This wasn't my first experience but it was for my kids and they surely were having a great time. So we've been going there since. After the pandemic, we started going back again and this time we found out they also have lunch takeouts and the price is very decent. Sushi lunch is $25 comes with 7pieces sushi which are tuna, yellow tail, fluke, 2kinds of salmon, boiled shrimp, eel and one roll of your choice. I love that they specify the sushi names for you on the plastic cover. The fish is fresh and you can feel the high quality. They accept credit card and can make online order so you don't have to wait.",0
"As soon as we walked in, I knew this was going to be a delicious meal! Service was very good. It's tapa style, but you can also order bigger meals if you would rather do that. I had the free yelp check in shot and a jalapeño margarita. We shared the popcorn chicken, pork dumplings, roasted vegetables and tiger roll. Everything came out quickly and packed with flavor! I left full, but satisfied. I would come back!!",0
Stopped by today to grab banh mi for my family. The place was empty and didn't really wait that long. I ordered the #1 (sadly it didn't come with pate ) It was pretty decent in taste and well packed with ingredients but it wasn't that amazing. I feel like it was lacking something.,0
"I walked by, and saw that amazing outdoor seating set up, and knew I had to come try the food. Their mini chalets remind me of Europe and Christmas market season! They also have heat lamps to keep you warm and wonderful customer service. Oh, and the delicious food! Green curry was REALLY good, and the pineapple fried rice was also really delicious. We also all enjoyed their lychee iced tea with dinner.I'll most definitely be back, and can't wait until we're pass COVID 19, when I can feel confident about eating indoors again.",0
"I cannot recommend this place enough! The flavors are amazing and veryunique- I've never tasted anything like it. However, be warned- the ""mala"" sauce they use is very spicy because they use a lot of pepper corn (that spice that lingers on your tongue). 

As a vegetarian, the tofu is phenomenal- I've tried them all and have never been disappointed. The vegetables are perfectly good (cooked with a perfect crunch factor to them). The only thing I'm not a fan of are the drinks. I didn't love the flavors and they were pretty diluted. They have massive portions, so you can get one bowl with 4-5 add ons (plus 1-2 proteins) and can split it. I've already gone here 10+ times and have always had a great experience!",1
"Two Wheels is already one of my favorite restaurants this year! The Deluxe Pho is amazing, and the meatballs, brisket, and steak are all delicious. And the broth is so flavorful! I'm not a Pho person, but I love this dish. Yesterday, we ordered via Uber Eats, and I just added some extra noodles and extra broth. The char grilled pork was so delicious! The pork was grilled perfectly, and the baguette was the star of the show. I feel like they should start selling the baguettes, because I'm definitely buying! I'm looking forward to trying the Thai Iced Tea, Vietnamese Coffee, and all the other banh mi variants. Keep it up, Two Wheels!",1
"This place is more like 4.5 stars than 4. Everything I have had here in the past few months has been excellent from their chocolate cake to their mini pumpkin bunt cake and their red velvet cupcakes. I came in on Thanksgiving to pick up a pumpkin cheesecake and it was also quite tasty. I am gluten free so I really appreciate this place and don't feel like I am missing out. Their stuff is also perfect for gatherings. Everything is also dairy free FYI.  Even if you are not gf or dairy free you will still enjoy this place...promise. Staff is helpful, I have only had one annoying experience when I  trying to pick out a chocolate cake for my birthday, I asked if I told them what I wanted if they could help suggest something and instead they just gave me a big book to look through (sigh). Anyway, amazing options for Thanksgiving including cornbread and dinner rolls too. Next year I will get my order in early.",0
"Yeah, I don't know. This was my first time here and it was my birthday smh. My waiters energy was off so I got my food to go. The place is nice and it's a vibe for sure. So after sitting for about 10 min my waiter comes over and takes my drink order and was rushy with me so I picked something I thought I would like. My drink was weak period!!!. Then he attending to his other tables so I sit for what felt like forever for him to come back. He did come back but after taking an order from guests who had just came in and had the nerve to wink at me like I see you I'm coming lol smh. That's when I said let me get my food to go because now I'm feeling some type of way. So the guy brings out my food to go with no bag lol, I'm like hi, can I get a bag smh. And then I left. The crazy thing is that I've been trying to get here for the longest my and my best friend was planning on coming here soon as well. I will give them another try but I will make sure I don't get that waiter again!!!.",0
"Overall, the pizza at the DUMBO TimeOut Market location was good. I was able to order ahead on the timeout app and just went over from our table to pick it up. The pizzas were satisfying as a snack with beers from the neighboring bar at the market. However, I mainly only came here because the lines for julianas and grimaldis were too long.",1
"The restaurant was crowded when we went, and it was hard to get waitstaff's attention. The food was mediocre, and my siblings and I were not satisfied with it. However, it did fill our stomachs. It was difficult to get waitstaff to come by if you didn't speak Chinese. Additionally, you are charged for tea. I drink tea, so fortunately we paid for something we'll actually drink. I ordered desserts and the jelly rabbits were so cute! I'm the only one in my family who loves durian, so I also ordered the durian pastry. They didn't have any durian at the time I ordered, so we waited quite a bit for it. The waiters (non-cart) people were constantly running around and were extremely busy. It's normal to wave like a psycho to get the cart and totally ok to walk up to the cart and check what's in there. I'd go earlier if you want a lot of food, there wasn't much left by the time we got there. Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant, but make sure you go during a less busy time.",1
Quickly becoming our favorite late evening watering hole. The snow pea shoot with bean curd (also has garlic in it!) is fire.The sweet and sour pork (bone in riblets) is very delicious; I especially love the addition of lychees. A+++The fried ginger scallion flounder today wasn't as impressive as it was- not exactly sure why but it was still yummy in my tummy. The chicken. omg. The Chicken. Roast soy garlic toasted chicken whatever it's named- they'll know.. bc it's actually their bestseller here. Is Amazing. Chicken is so silky and moist while the skin is crackling almost like lechon sprayed with fried garlic shallots and scallions w a sweet soy Au jus. Jus chefs kiss. We also had the crispy walnut shrimp which was predictably delicious. Some things u don't Fck with. Uncle Lou we fcking w u any day all day. See u very soon.Ps... if they offer their complimentary sweet soup dessert- jus do it. The taro sweet potato tapioca was just sweetened a tad and so warm and coconutty gingery. Sorta snaps u back into place after a marathon meal.,0
"Finally decided to try out this new vegetarian restaurant and I'm so glad I did! The line moved quickly and we didn't wait long at all to get our food. The burnt broccoli and the farro salad were both loved by my partner, whereas I thought the lentils and polenta dish was amazing. The TFT (Tofu Fried Tofu) was so freakin' good. One thing we both agreed on was the gelato was a not to be missed addition. Such fun flavors. A pro tip: even for two people, just order one of everything!",1
"Came in for a catch up date with one of my girls after she said the one in Astoria has an amazing tequila selection and also because of #TacoTuesday. From what I was told this location has the same extensive tequila selection. Drinks: no happy hour. Drinks were delicious but considering that no happy hour, the ice to liquid ratio in my La Refrescante was interesting lol -- nevertheless the drinks were good! & I also tried the La MoritaFood: I had the Dorodos De Camaron. For the price I immediately wished the portion was bigger. So while it was good, it's also overpriced. After being told the Astoria location has happy hour on food & drink, I would stop there if in the area.",0
"Overall, I thought Lolita's was a decent place to have lunch. The burgers were solid, and the fries were delicious. However, I found it a bit odd that the menu on the website was different than the one we received, and the patties were definitely well done. The service was also good, but I would've liked to see the restaurant checked on more often.",1
"Modern and super clean! You're greeted with all smiles and friendliness. There's a soft drink fountain! Good selection of veggies (found a friend in one of our veggies plate tho) and noodles (way too many to choose from actually, but more variety to cater to non-Asians). Good selection different types of fish balls (I only wish they have the other kind of fish roe balls :( )Broths were bland as any other places but the trick is to go to the sauce bar, take a bunch of garlic, herbs, some sauces and dump that into your broth, boom, life changing.And they didn't have SACHA SAUCE LIKE WHAT",0
"Max Caffe is a great place to come for a cup of coffee and a croissant. The service is always kind and generous, and if you're ever in a hurry, they can accommodate that. I really wish there was a Max Caffe near where I live, but I'm glad it's still there.",1
"I stopped by Central for lunch today and I was really impressed! The location is great, and the indoor dining area looked lovely and cute. From what I could tell, it looks like an equally good option, based on some reviews here.

The service was very consistent and attentive. The food was also very fair price for quantity and quality of food. Plus, there are daily lunch specials which made it even more affordable.

I got the grilled octopus with burrata and fussolini with langostine. Both dishes were really good. I would definitely recommend Central to anyone looking for a good meal at a fair price.",1
"I absolutely loved the restaurant's interior and the cleanliness! However, I was very disappointed with the sushi I ordered. The toro and lobster were both fresh, but the crab was really fishy and weird. The rice was also terrible - it was mushy and had a weird color. Overall, it was a poor experience and I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Noodle Village is one of my favorite Chinatown restaurants and I was so happy to finally get a chance to try it out last weekend. The inside of the restaurant was quite empty, which made it feel much safer and allowed us to enjoy our meal even more. We ordered the soup dumplings, a wonton noodle soup, and a beef brisket soup and everything arrived quickly and was delicious. The pork and shrimp wontons were my favorite - they were so juicy and tender and the shrimp was unbelievably fresh. The egg noodles were also very good and very chewy. The HK style beef brisket soup was good, but the beef was not as tender as I would have liked. The soup dumplings were a great surprise - they were sizable and had a very thin skin which made them very tasty. I would definitely come back to Noodle Village and recommend it to others.",1
"I had a great time at Spoon Table & Bar! The atmosphere was very romantic and the staff was very attentive. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy, which made it difficult to get our server's attention. Nevertheless, the food was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic night out!",1
"I had a really great experience at Taverna Kyclades East Village! The location is definitely better than the one in Astoria, and the portions are definitely worth it. The only downside is that the floor tiles are very slippery when wet, so be careful! The grilled octopus was also a great choice, and the salad was also very good. The only thing I didn't like was the steak tomatoes, and the fried whiting was also great. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
Roast Kitchen is not a restaurant I would recommend. The chicken Gaucho I ordered was dry and the salad was overpoweringly onion-y. I didn't enjoy my experience here at all.,1
I'm glad to have Joe and Pat's in Manhattan now. I used to go to the original location years ago after a round of golf. This is a super chill spot on the LES. The pizza is terrific. Thin crispy crust with some chew to it too. The sauce is bright with a nice tang.,1
"Now that I've noticed that this restaurant has people making fake yelp accounts to react ""funny"" to negative reviews, I will definitely never be going here ever again. what's funny about someone experiencing racism at your restaurant? What's funny about someone not being allowed to join their friends reservation because they were too late? This place is a joke. Maybe that's why they have their staff making fake yelp accounts and voting ""funny"" to all negative reviews. Do yourself a favor and look at all of the 1-3 star reviews and look how many ""funny"" votes they have. Then look at the account names - You will notice they are all the same names.",0
"I had a great time at this Somali restaurant in Harlem. The atmosphere was cozy and casual, and the staff was very friendly. I ordered my food via my phone, and it was a bit frustrating at first, but the food was really good. The roti wrap was especially delicious, and the mango pickle added a nice contrast to the flavors. The vegetables in the mango sauce were similar in flavor to the vegetables in the roti wrap, but they were still very good. The mango juice was very fresh. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something unique and casual.",1
"I ordered a sandwich for lunch (tomato, mozzarella, arugula, and avocado on a baguette), and because of work wasn't able to pick it up until it was closer to dinner time. I was worried that the tomatoes would've made it too soggy to eat, and that the avocado wouldn't have tasted fresh. Even though it was a little soggy because of the tomato, it was still really good. I would definitely order from here again.",0
"My friend and I came to Up Thai around 6:30pm on a Wednesday.  Had my friend been there, we would have been seated immediately.  However, they only seat complete parties, so they put me down on the Yelp waitlist.  My friend arrived around 7pm (those train delays), and we were seated within the next few minutes.  However, it was completely packed around 7:30pm!  The interior is nicely decorated, but it can get loud as tables are near each other.  We ordered the chicken satay ($9), pad thai with tofu ($13), and panang curry with chicken ($14).  The chicken satay was a pretty good deal.  It came with 4 skewers of chicken and a side of garlic bread.  The chicken was flavored well but was a tad dry.  Luckily, the delicious peanut dipping sauce helped with that.  The garlic bread was amazing!  It was a little on the oily side but the flavor was on point.  My friend is a big fan of Up Thai, and the pad thai is a favorite of hers.  I was impressed with the flavors of the curry as well as the amount of chicken and veggies that were in it.  The curry had mild heat, but I wouldn't let that steer you away unless you really cannot handle spicy food.  I was also impressed with the service.  The managers at Up Thai clearly hold their employees to a different standard.  Our server did multiple check-backs and just had a genuine warm and friendly vibe.  Our waters were constantly refilled and you can actively see the supervisor managing the floor.  The only downside to this is that that homey vibe is lost when everything is operating like a business.  Overall, pricing is competitive with Thai restaurants in NYC.  Since Up Thai has put out the best flavors I've tasted in NYC so far, I feel like it's well worth the price and will be back to try out more dishes!",0
"So I took my little sister to this location since there's restrictions of age in the other one and i must say I think I liked this one a bit too much . It's close ! My margarita was awesome . My little sister had a great time for her birthday , service was awesome they wasn't pushy ""! Cough cough .  Food didn't take 5 hours , cough cough.  Came out with the candle and the little fudge cake and the happy birthday song and my sister was happy , and we called it a day ! They made it happen .  Would go back for another margarita !",0
Really just not edible food. I threw out the sushi. The salad had some weird dressing on it and the lettuce looked like it had gone bad. The sushi was mostly rice with small pieces of fish. I ordered dumplings in a peanut sauce and it tasted like watered down sauce.,0
"The pork buns are delicious and make a great appetizer. The waiters were attentive and our food came out quickly. The only downside is that the soup didn't have a lot of flavor and we probably ordered the wrong broth. The main dish I tried was good, but I'll probably try something different on the menu next time.",1
"Only place I go to dyckman for is to go to mama sushi . I go often I'll say just because im big on atmosphere and I really love the food . The staff very professional . Only thing is how long you have to wait for a table sometimes, is ridiculous . But I'll say is definitely worth the wait .",0
"Indian Accent is a solid, higher end Indian food establishment in Midtown with a nice inside. Dined in a few years ago and I remember they also had tasty cocktails. This review is geared towards a more recent experience with delivery for dinner. Food came well packaged and food was warm and delicious. I had the Old Delhi butter chicken that came with basmati rice and laccha paratha.  Great flavors but without being too oily or leaving you feel bloated once the meal is over. Would eat here again.",0
"I recently celebrated a friends birthday here and the ambiance was very nice. One thing that I enjoy is aesthetically pleasing businesses, and the service was amazing, our server was always on top of drinks or refilling our waters, they came to check on us often to make sure our experience was pleasurable. The reason for my 4 star rating is the food was not as amazing as it was presented. The presentation was definitely on point. A few of us ordered several of the dinner specials. My biggest issue was there wasn't a variety in the food selection. If I could expand on anything, it would be to add more green veggies to the menu. The flavors were good. I just wish it was more robust. I wasn't dissatisfied, but I definitely expected a lot more.",1
"I've been here a few times now and decided to finally write my review. I like the grill because it is open during the day as opposed to for dinner. They check your vax cards and then you are seated. A few times we were seated on the elevated area and once we were seated by the window, which I prefer.The grill is small and tight, the tables are essentially on top of each other. If someone behind you needs extra space you are forced to squeeze in to the point where it is almost uncomfortable. The service for the most part is good. We had one waiter who seemingly forgot about us.I've had the Malbec every time and it's delicious. For appetizer I've had the fried zucchini and onion rings. Cooked to fried perfection and lightly breaded.I've had the filet mignon Cajun style, and the grill sirloin. Both are very flavorful. The sirloin was ordered medium but came out well done. The filet was and still is my most favorite steak. For sides I've had the Brussels sprouts and the creamed spinach which was also delicious. We split the cheesecake on one occasion and it was a tad dry.",0
"I had a great time at Village Taverna! The food was delicious and the complimentary pita was a nice touch. The restaurant is located right by Union Square, so it's a great place to go for a meal. I was a vegetarian, but they didn't have a falafel option, so I was a bit disappointed. However, the main dish they had was delicious and there were many sides to choose from. Overall, I had a great time at Village Taverna and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I was very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. I arrived on holiday Monday after Juneteenth and it took 20 minutes to be seated. Then once we were seated, no one came to take our order for another 20 minutes! I was starving by then, so had to leave because it seemed like it would be hopeless. It turns out they only have one waiter for about 15 tables, which is poor planning. Most other tables were also struggling to get their order taken or pay for the bill. I likely won't be returning.",1
"Zooba is a restaurant I would recommend for anyone looking for a quick and tasty meal. The staff is friendly and the food is great. My favorite dish was the cheese hawashi, which was served with a crispy pita and a delicious burger. The only downside was that the burger was a little messy to eat, but it was definitely worth it.",1
"I absolutely loved the food at this restaurant! The oyster appetizer was amazing, and the box we had was made with top quality ingredients. It can be a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it for the quality of food. The dessert was a bit of a let-down, though.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The Australian Chef's food is definitely something to check out. The portions were a bit small, but that's to be expected in a restaurant like this. The staff was very attentive and made sure everyone was getting their wine and food. Overall, a great experience.",1
"Like this place a lot. Been here twice (during covid) and had a really nice dinner each time. So far I've had the steak frites, burger and French onion soup. The soup was really great the first time, a little less good the second (a little watery). Good portion and generous on the cheese which is always a huge positive.The steak frites was delicious, sizable steak (I think 12 ounces, or close) and amazing fries. I am a huge bearnaise fan so I like how they give you an option for au pouvire or bearnaise, unlike many places. Burger was also good, although I'd definitely return to the steak frites when I got back.GREAT outdoor setup if you can get a spot on the street, but the other side is nice and warm too. Overall I like this place a lot, and look forward to coming back!",0
"I had a great time at Los Tacos No. 1 last night! The breakfast burrito was amazing - the eggs, potatoes, and bacon were all cooked perfectly and the hot sauce gave it a great flavor. The only downside was that the burrito was a bit small, but at $6 it's definitely a cheaper option than at Pretamanger. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great breakfast option.",1
"Very vegan friendly and healthy Japanese spot. Everything is clearly labeled and they have tons of variety for vegans, and it's all low calorie. Sushi, salads, bentos, miso and dumplings are all grab and go (Pret style), then they have made to order soups, rice bowls and noodle bowls. I just found out this existed and I really want it to stick around. Perfect for a quick lunch to take back to work, but they have casual seating too that's kind of tucked away",0
"I ordered the spare rib combo from here for delivery, and when the delivery guy came he kept some of the change for his tip. I told him to give me my change and if I want to give him a tip I would. So he ended up getting a smaller tip than what I would normally have given. When I took the food out of the bag the first thing I noticed was that all the rooms were burnt. I called the restaurant with my complaint and they tried to tell me that that was barbecue sauce. He really tried hard to explain that it was sauce. Umm I guess then the sauce was burnt. The fried rice wasn't good either but the egg roll was pretty good.

I only ordered from here because the one I normally would order from was closed today and I was feeling lazy, and didn't want to cook. Lesson learned! I will not order from here again.",1
"This is the original West Village shop of the famous Joe's Pizza in New York City.  It long ago became famous for its pizza by the 'slice.'  I've heard sometimes the owner & founder Pino ""Joe"" Pozzuoli shows up here to work in the kitchen. One thing is for sure....it is always busy.But I absolutely did not find any thing special about the pizza. The consistency of the crust was limp, the ingredients totally ordinary, and it costs a lot more than other slices in NYC.  Perhaps my standards for pizza have risen significantly over the last few years with all the tasty pizzas I have eaten in Philly & Vienna & other cities including New York.  I know NYC takes pride in its pizza and I'm always happy to see traditions like Joe's survive and thrive, but I'll check out other pizzas or slices in the future.",0
"The Indian restaurant is a bit pricey, but the food is delicious. The pulled jackfruit tacos are a genius idea, and the black dal was creamy and buttery. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"This place has serious potential, if only they tweaked their management slightly. Came here with a group of friends on a Sunday for brunch. Walking in, loved the bar area. Whole place has a clean modern feel with essence of an Irish old fashion bar flare. Excellent drink selection, reasonable brunch special. Some of us ordered eggs, some ordered pancakes, everything was delicious. Only issue is, it took us practically one hour to get our meal from the time we ordered, we also didn't have anyone really come by to check on us or let us know the food would be a little later. It was a little disappointing but I would consider going back for drinks.",0
"I went here with three female colleagues on Friday (3/6) after work. As we walked in, the man seating us asked if others would be joining us, and we said two more. He proceeded to say, ""I hope those aren't men or husbands joining you."" Incredibly inappropriate and gross. In addition to that, the drinks are overpriced and the food is not good. Edamame and pine nuts on guacamole? No thanks. Even if the food and drinks had been good I would never return to this place. We couldn't wait to get away from the skeezy stares of all the men who were working there.",0
"Disclaimer: I was not able to take photos but I will do my best to describe the plates. We got 4 tapas and the main issue actually wasn't any problem with the taste. The Empanadas were delicious, the flatbread pizza was decent, and the arepas were good as well. First of all, this place seems to be packed on weekends. So even with our reservation, they seated us about 15 min late. Secondly, they have a nice set up for outdoor seating but they did not turn on the heated lamps until much later in day, even though the temperature was in the 40s that day...and when they did, it seemed to be on power saver mode as it would turn off intermittently. Several customers opted to just keep their coats on. Next the service was ""ok"". I understand it's busy but their timings were off and when we asked for the check, it took nearly 20 minutes for them to bring it. The food size was the major concern, it's priced from 20-30 dollars which even for tapas would make me consider reasonable sized, but one average person could have at least like 3 tapas to be satiated, making this a 3/4 dollar sign restaurant. Something to consider before coming here. Taste was good and ambience was nice with live music. Again, apologies for no picture of food",0
"I had a 12-person birthday dinner here and it couldn't have gone more smoothly. Service was amazing, our server was constantly checking up on our party to make sure we had the chance to order food/drinks. The cocktails were incredible and the food was absolutely delicious. Highlights include the roasted octopus, prawns, pepper croquettes, mushroom crepes and beets. Vibes in this place were also great. The music was at the perfect level so you could still have a conversation but still feel like you were in a lively spot. I will definitely be back here soon!",0
I had a really interesting experience at this restaurant - I've never had something that tasted like this before. It almost tasted like a toasted tortilla but then also has a sesame bread texture. It's crunchy but also soft on the inside where the ingredients are. It's reminds me of a pita bread also but it's much thinner and crispier. They have a nice Yelp check in offer right now and we got the preserved veggies flavor since we didn't want something spicy. (Not sure how spicy the other ones are). I really like it! It's a tad bit salty on the first bite but the more you eat the tastier it gets. Highly recommend trying it!,1
"Glad I got to try this place and overall a solid omakase experience. Came for dinner at 9:45PM on a Friday night. The restaurant is small with a 10ish-seat sushi bar, three omakase chefs and a small alcove space with a table for around 4.SUSHI: we went a little crazy and all ordered the $180, 20+ piece omakase. The meal started with a bowl of sashimi (three small pieces of 3 types of tuna), and some other small sushi/sashimi appetizers that I can't recall. Overall was pretty good but acted mostly as fillers until the actual omakase/nothing was mindblowing. The meal really began once the omakase started. Even though we all came hungry, the 20+ option ended up being a bit too much. I would recommend the step below so you're not excessively full at the end/can appreciate each piece.The sushi pieces were relatively big cuts of fish. As always, the standouts for me were the fatty tuna (the fatty tuna here was probably the best I've ever had), medium fatty tuna, two different types of uni (Maine and Tokyo) and seared eel piece (again, probably the best eel piece I've ever had). They also served some unique pieces like clam, octopus and smoked crab. Can't say I loved those. VERDICT: The truth is, though the quality of the fish and the meal were excellent, in terms of best omakase for best value, this place can't beat Sushi by Bou. It's definitely worth visiting if you're in the mood for spending some $$$ on omakase and a pleasant / filling omakase experiences, but if you're looking for value and same level of fresh quality sushi, I think you can get as great sushi (though smaller cuts of fish) at Sushi by Bou.",0
"The food was delicious and the drinks were refreshing. The only downside was that the tacos were a bit smaller than I expected. The service was good and the music was perfect for the atmosphere. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"I was walking around the city and passed this restaurant when I came down Mulberry Street, on my way to Chinatown. I was exploring and taking photographs and when it was time to get something to eat -- I went back to DA Gennaro! It was a nice afternoon so I sat outside. There were a few other tables with people and they filled up even more after I arrived. I ordered one of the $25 lunch specials. I ordered the Chicken Francese which came with a salad, bread and dessert. I chose Tiramisu for dessert. All of the food was delicious and nice portions, too. For a drink I had a diet coke. One thing to note -- there are no free refills, so every time I got a refill - it was another $4 added to my bill. Oh well, lesson learned. I had several servers -- that's the way they do it here, and they were all nice and attentive.",0
"I had a few things delivered from here this weekend and while they were fine, they didn't meet the mark compared to some recent Thai takeout and delivery I've had. The pad Thai mun poo was the best of the lot, while the papaya salad and the larb were fine, and the sundried beef simply didn't travel well. In person, it was much better when hot and fresh. I wouldn't recommend delivery here but maybe in person would be good.",1
"The chocolate shop section of this restaurant is really cute and has a lot of different options for chocolate lovers. The dark chocolate covered caramelized pecans are my favorite item here and the online store delivers almost all of the in-store products so you can have them delivered to you or a someone else. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high, but the quality of the chocolate makes up for it.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! I ordered the fugazza, the chicken, the spinach with cheese and the corn in bechamel. All of it was great. I also ordered through grubhub, so it was really convenient. Fugazza here is onion and cheese. In Argentina, a fugazza is like a foccaccia and often without tomato sauce. Empanadas were baked. This is how they should be. I would definitely come back!",1
"The food was good and the lunch special was even better  for $11.95 you get a soup, pasta and a glass of wine. The bartender Shanissa was really friendly and funny and so was a regular named Ed. The penne a la vodka was just right. I also had a margarita afterwords. It was happy hour time and the margarita was $5. I sat at the bar with the regulars. Spanish and hip hop music was playing in the background and I can see this being a happy hour spot to a pregame spot. Everyone was so friendly and if I'm ever uptown I'll come back.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The Philly cheesesteak was delicious and the meatball sandwich was also very good. The portions were large and the prices were reasonable. I didn't love the salad, though, it was a bit overpriced for what it was and the iceberg lettuce was really all that was included. But overall I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The staff is unprofessional and racist. They did not allow me to join my friends reservation because I was too late, and then they made fake yelp accounts to vote ""funny"" on all the negative reviews. This place is a joke and I will never go back.",1
"I ordered from here using the Seamless app as they advertised having 25% off on the first order. I got the Lamb Shish Kebab Bowl which contained marinated cubes of lamb, rice, salad, hummus, and baked bread. Red and white sauce were also included. Which I liked using the red sauce to dip my bread in as I found it to have a nice kick. The food itself is pretty good and pretty filling.The service there is what killed it for me as I tried explaining that I was here for a Seamless pickup order and they guy didn't understand what I was getting at and was pretty rude about it until another employee came to save the day.The Seamless discount is what enticed me to give this place a try and although the food is decent, I hate dealing with rude people so because of that, I will most likely be avoiding this place.",0
Not the same as the old two bridges diner on the corner. Menu seems to have been redacted and no longer include the old breakfast platters. Bacon egg and cheese on a roll which is a new York City breakfast classic came with very thin and overly done bacon. The roll was rubbery and did not hold up well.,0
"Jacob's Pickles is a restaurant I've been wanting to visit for a while, and I'm so glad I finally did! The patio area was really cold and we had to move inside, but that didn't stop us from enjoying our meal. I ordered a mint tea and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and both were delicious. The portion sizes were really large, and I was definitely not expecting that. I can't wait to come back and order something off the menu!",1
"I had a great experience at Nish Nush! The food was ready to be picked up on the spot, and the lemonana drink was a great addition. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I was really impressed with Hey Yuet - a mid-range uptown dim sum-focused restaurant paying exorbitant Chelsea rent while providing dishes New Yorkers are used to paying 2/3 of the price for in Chinatown. The portions are slightly smaller, the prices are somewhat higher, and the quality is just a hair different than Chi-town, Flushing or Sunset Park.

The standout item was the Steamed Rice with Spare Ribs. They do the brown glaze for these ribs (as opposed to the clear corn starch + black bean glaze more common in old-school Canto spots), and the combination of that sauce with white rice and bok choy that have absorbed the sauce's flavor is just delicious. The portion was smaller than I'm used to, but...I was prepared for that. Still worth getting.

I loved that they offered the fancier style of custard buns with charcoal dough and edible gold brush. I was spoiled with this upscale version in my hometown of Toronto, but haven't seen many places offer it in NYC. Sadly, HY's version is much smaller (again), and the dough is too chewy, while the custard was too runny and grainy. Still, the general",1
"I was excited to try out this place when I was visiting NY since I have heard about this place from other people. There was only one worker taking everyone's order and making the food but the wait was not long at all. I got the salmon, beef bulgogi, spicy chicken, spicy mushroom and a yuja ade. My favorite was the salmon and the beef bulgogi. The drink was also very refreshing and yummy. I recommend this spot if you're looking for a quick and easy snack in the East Village.",0
"It is just OK. Ambience was a 10/10, service was great but the food didn't live up to the hype. We ordered the chicken satay x2 , chicken lettuce wraps, Beijing chicken and soup dumplings. Soup dumplings were good.The chicken satay is as delicious as they say 10/10, but that's about it. The rest of the food that we ordered was mediocre & not worth $140. Would I come back? Sure maybe, I would give it another try. But for right now this place deserves a solid 3.",0
"Another must go to place in NY. Pizza is always delicious. The thin crust with yummy toppings. Even the cheese pizza is good. I prefer my pizza with toppings, so any of them are delicious.",0
"I stopped by this Thai restaurant after seeing it several times. The lobby is really nice and the food was really good! I got the Tom Yum noodle soup and Papaya Salad. The Tom Yum noodle soup was really good, not too spicy but it was still good. It had a very homey feel to it. The papaya salad was also really good, nice and crunchy. Not too spicy with this either, but it was good. The service was also really good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"The appetizer portions are too small for the price. If you like soba, there is no better place. The soba portions and prices were reasonable. We went on a Saturday evening but made the mistake of not making a reservation and ended up waiting for 2.5 hours for a table. I ordered the jar-jar soba but I liked my friend's goma soba more bc it had more flavor especially if you dip it in their sesame dressing that comes on the side. I would definitely go back to try the other soba dishes. Service here was okay.",0
"I stopped by for happy hour while visiting a friend in Manhattan, and I was impressed with the value. The drinks were delicious, and I especially enjoyed the hummus and lychee martini. The bartender was very friendly, and I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
Jane Restaurant is a great place to go for brunch. The service is friendly and the food is delicious. The atmosphere is also great - it's very comfortable and casual. I would definitely recommend Jane Restaurant to anyone looking for a great brunch experience.,1
"The original Joju location in Elmhurst was on my list forever but as Queens is a trek for me, the new Midtown location has been way more convenient. I have had the classic Sweet Joju (pâté, ham, caramel pork) and the beef bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated ribeye, kimchi) banh mis and while I really enjoyed them, I still think there are some minor improvements to be made. For one, the pickled carrots and daikon lack acid-- they're much too mild and sweet. The lightly toasted baguette, while dependable, lacks the airiness and crispiness that defines an exceptional banh mi. Overall, some solid sandwiches in the area. I would recommend getting spicy mayo and jalapeños added to your sandwich for some smoky, spicy, creaminess. The aji verde is also fantastic but doesn't travel well; get it on the side if possible.",0
"Found this gastropub while visiting New York on holiday. Lots of TVs for sporting events, quick seating, and a plentiful liquor selection here. The food was decent for a bar and the drinks were strong! Highly recommend if your in the area. Located a few blocks from time square and worth the walk.",0
"The Flatiron Room offers a great experience for anyone looking to enjoy some great music and cocktails. The food is not up to par, but the drinks are amazing. The service is very attentive but not hovering - this is a great option for those who want to relax and enjoy their time.",1
"This place has been all the rage and hype among Instagram food bloggers. The obvious comparison on social media and Yelp is with Prince Street Pizza. While many say it's comparable, I don't think it's even in the same league.Got a square pizza with pepperoni. The thickness and crust are delicious, but the corners and sides were practically burnt. I love a crispy corner but while not totally charred, it was ""cooked"" a bit too much. It wasn't even limited to one corner - the black char basically bordered the entire pizza.The pizza also didn't have much sauce - while it's a preference thing, I love it saucy and this place didn't quite deliver. A bit dry.Finally, just overall - while I know a square pizza with pepperoni will be salty, this place was extreme salt overload. After I eat two slices from Prince Street, I don't feel dehydrated all day; this place left me thirsty for the rest of the day, despite tons of water.It's a decent local place, but wouldn't make the trek.",0
"Avoid this place if you want good pizza.  Think airport pizza places. You know, where they make whole pizzas in advance and then throw the slice in the oven. I ordered 4 slices for my nephew and me.  I asked if they would heat them up. I was told they just took the pizza out of the oven.  They hadn't.  I had to ask the server for two trays when she tried to pile 4 slices on one tray.  Sat down to eat and the pizza has no taste and a soft crust.  Pure crap.  So, one water,one can Diet Coke and 4 slices of meat lovers pizza....$30.76!!My biggest regret of the trip to NY.  I wish I had used Yelp first.",0
"I am so glad I finally visited Veselka! The interior is really nice and the staff were attentive and friendly. The Meat Plate I ordered was delicious and I loved the addition of the vegetarian borscht. It was definitely busy when we went, so I'm glad we got in quickly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Jeez Louise Joe's, just keeping doing your thing. Jam packed with a jolt of what an authentic New York slice should look and taste like. While it might appear Plain Jane, this slice is anything but that. Plain slice: The thin crust is what makes Joe's special. Combine it with that thin layer of sauce and that thin layer of cheese and it is a slice that packs a thick punch of quality. Once you try it, you will not want to stop. This is why you get two slices. Unfortunately, because of its FiDi (Financial District) location, it will add up quickly if you let it.White slice: Solid, real solid. I am sold on this one because of the nice layers of ricotta cheese, and that thin layer of garlic that will keep you from killing anybody who walks past you. It is a fairly clean slice too, which is hard for a white slice. Consider these two slices your Batman and Robin, your Jerry and George, these two slices go together.You also get to enjoy the sight of One World Trade (the Freedom Tower) as you eat your pizza.Writers Note: The original Joe's Pizza is located on Carmine Street in Greenwich. Definitely try that one out too for comparisons sake.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good. However, nothing really stood out to me. The drinks were all pretty standard, and the mousse was definitely the best dish. All in all, it was a decent experience, but nothing to write home about.",1
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Guadalupe, and I have to say that the food was fantastic! The steak burritos were especially delicious - the amount of meat was solid and so were the burritos themselves. They came with a generous amount of rice and little beans, plus guacamole, salsa and sour cream on the side. The only downside was that the portion size was a bit small, but overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant for Korean bbq and it was still pretty packed on a weekday night. The overall taste is good, but service was okay. The meat quality, however, is not as good as it used to be. But, on average, I still think it's a decent place to eat.",1
"I went to this place on a Friday before a concert. It's a super convenient location to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. It wasn't super crowded when we got there at first around 6 p.m., but it started to pick up during our meal. We had a reservation and because of traffic were late, but they were very nice and had a table available for us immediately. The staff was extremely nice and the decor is trendy. I like the interior design. We ordered the mushroom/truffle flatbread, fried calamari, the pretzel, the nachos and Korean lettuce wraps. We also ordered a chicken quesadilla but I think they forgot about it because it never came. No biggie, that's when we ordered the pretzel, which was really good. We asked for the quesadilla without chicken, but were told it was pre made, which made me think it wasn't going to be that fresh anyway. Overall, this place was good - accommodating, convenient, attentive and the food was very tasty. I'd definitely come back and recommend it.",0
"Pandan Chicken looks beautiful but the chicken was too salty. Don't know if the leaf wrap on the outside adds anything to the dish since it was deep fried. All types of cuisines whether it is Spanish, Chinese and etc, the leaf wraps are boiled or steamed and the process added flavor and holds the flavor inside. This wrap is partially wrapped. The sweet and sour dipping sauce is great though.  Pan Mee was just ok and it wasn't what I expected. It tasted more like mediocre Japanese soup and not Malaysian at all.  I've been dining in tons of Malaysian restaurants for over 15 years.",0
I've been to Selena Rose several times in the past year.    Food is better than expected and always cooked as requested.  Drink specials are good and you can never go wrong with a margarita pitcher.    Only issue my girlfriend and I have is the service.   The service is usually always slow and they seem disorganized most of the time.,0
"I was really excited to try out Salls, but unfortunately my experience was not great. We entered the restaurant at 11:10 and were told that they were not open until 11:30. This was funny because it was clearly stated on the door that the restaurant opened at 11:00am. The male employee was very stand offish towards us and barely made eye contact when we were trying to find out where we should sit. We order steak and eggs with the bottomless mimosas and I'm not sure why they asked how we wanted our eggs, because we were all served 'well done' on all aspects! My steak was very small and thin, eggs resembled hockey pucks! At $35 a plate, most of us sent our food back! It took forever to get all the plates out. My second steak was literally served to me raw, I'm not exaggerating as you will see in the picture. I sent that back, and at least the outside of it looked like it touched a hot surface when it was returned to me! It was still pretty extra rare on the inside and not what I asked for! Eggs were better second time around. Many of our group complained that the food was not cooked appropriately once they received it. You",1
"We had reservations for Sunday brunch and were seated right away. I ordered the oeuf au plat, which was a baked egg dish with mortadella, comte cheese and crispy baguette. It was so unctuous and comforting. My husband ordered the roast chicken and raved it was delicious. The wine served are all natural wines - I tried two different whites that I did NOT like - before I fell in love with the rose. Our server was patient and wanted to make sure that I got a wine that I enjoyed. For dessert, we perused the dessert options, but ended up deciding on the pancake (after hearing another table next to us order a pancake ""for the table""). This was a wonderful decision - the pancake is something you should order - and it is perfect for sharing. Sweet and buttery goodness. Despite all of the hype of this place, our dining experience felt very warm, friendly and easy like a Sunday morning ought to be.",0
"I swear I blinked and these multiplied. When the heck did they get so many locations....but whooo hooooo more locations with this magical kitchen! My god their chicken is delicious. Ugh and the green sauce!!! I love sauce and theirs is quite delicious. Three friends split the matador combo and had a round of drinks....each paid 25. A steal for that juicy ness! Pio pio exemplifies ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Bravo!!",1
"Comfort food that doesn't make you regret it, but slightly expensive.Food (5/5) - everything tasted amazing; the potatoes were excellently fried, the chicken shashlyk was melt in your mouth smooth and really well seasoned (not dry and tasteless on the inside), and both the chuchvara and the cheburek were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. None of the fried food was overly greasy.Price (3/5) - for the portions, this was a tad on the pricier side especially in the area. We paid $80 for everything. No leftovers or anything.Service (4/5) / Ambiance (3/5) - prompt but couldn't locate our reservation, somehow. The inside was really dim and the outside was a little dingy but worked in a pinch, and the decor was green and bright and kinda cute! Good place to grab a quick meal maybe.",0
"My bf and I love eating at Excellent Dumpling House! It saves us the trek to Chinatown for soup dumplings and it's also extremely convenient for us to get to.We always order the xiao long bao and each always get our own order. I've had the kung pao chicken and it was okay. The fried dumplings are pretty good too. Lo mein has a nice smoky wok flavor. I've always had a satisfying meal here and will continue to eat here. Also to note, my bf is an extremely picky eater who says he would gladly take a pill to obtain all of his nutrients if it means he doesn't have to eat food, since he doesn't particularly enjoy eating (his fatal flaw). However, he gives this place two thumbs up!!",0
"Exceptional.There are so many great places in NYC, but the really special places are those that you get to enjoy a bit before EEEEEVERYONE knows about them. And while I'm contributing a bit to shooting myself in the foot, this is one of those special places.Hermana lives at the center of a Venn diagram of great food, great drinks, great service, and really excellent entertainment.The real draw for me is the music. Live jazz, pretty much every night. This isn't karaoke or something comparable. This is real live jazz music by phenomenal musicians and vocalists.The food is great as are the drinks, but both are eclipsed by the service. These are genuinely friendly people that want you to have a good time.I hope folks stop by Hermana to listen to some tunes and just enjoy the vibe.Note that they add a modest cover charge for the musicians to your bill.",0
"This is a great small noodle spot. I stopped by for a late lunch during the week. It was pretty empty (probably because it's new) but it was clean, staff was friendly and very attentive and welcoming. I like that they offer noodle soup and bubble tea. I had ginger tea with their beef noodle soup and both were very tasty. The soup bad a alot of flavor, perfect amount of heat balanced with a good noodle to protein ratio. I would definitely visit again if I'm in the area and I highly recommend.",1
"I ordered a pick up for the cowboy bowl with Daring plant based chicken ($12.50) for an early lunch around 11. There was no line, and the order was ready on time. While the ingredients for this bowl were simple, the proportions were balanced, and the sauce was not too heavy and tied everything together well. The ""chicken"" was a bit tough to chew but was salty and went well with the lettuce. Just wish there were more vegan bowl options on the menu!",0
"I really hate coming to New York for pizza.  I get depressed knowing Chicago has nothing like it and only the deep dish which makes me wanted to diet for six months straight. Lots of white flour. As usual, this place hit the spot. I had chicken BBQ which had breaded chicken with cheese and BBQ sauce. Embarassingly enough I also had one of my THREE dinners there later that day and returned for the standard cheese slice with that signature new york chew to the crust. I am sad as I type and in serious withdrawal. The guy says to me ""Have you seen us on TV?"" I say ""I'm from Chicago"" Replies ""You don't have a TV in Chicago?"" I love NY.",0
"The restaurant has a Pig status outside and in the bathroom, super cute. For appetizers we ordered the soup dumplings which was so freakin good and the fried dumps. Which they give you a sauce tray with 4 diff sauces. For main we ordered the BBQ PORK RIBS, they're known for this dish. Sticky honey glazed ribs! Omg + everything is family style so larger portions. I wanted more pork ribs tho :) We also ordered the Beef hotpot which also comes in either fish or beef. Spicy so if you can take a heat, you'll love this with a side of rice. 

They also do Peking duck, carved table side for you!  Check it out!",1
"Overall, I thought the brunch at this cafe was pretty good. The wait for food was a bit long, but the food was comparable to other Manhattan brunch spots. The prices were also reasonable. I wouldn't necessarily come back based on this experience, but I'd definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Had a nice dinner at Sakagura.  We were able to make a reservation same day after emailing the restaurant. The fixed price menu was very good. The $85 prix fixe excludes sales tax and gratuity. We added on one dish to our dinner, the tofu and unagi salad. Our favorite dishes were the unagi/tofu, katsuo tataki and the blancmange dessert. The madai tsutsumi yaki sadly was over cooked. We also tried the sake beginner flight trio. The service was good. The decor was different than anything we've ever seen. Amazing really how they transformed a windowless commercial space in a NYC basement into a Japanese village. BrilliantGlad we tried Sakagura.  The menu is seasonal so we will return when the menu changes in the fall/winter.",0
"I came to this restaurant with high hopes, but unfortunately my experience was not as great as I had hoped. I ordered the Chile Pork and Pollo a La Mexicana tacos and they were just very subpar. The chile pork was good but not spicy at all. The pollo a la mexicana was even worse- the chicken was falling out of the tortilla, the chicken had no flavor at all, and the green sauce on top was the only flavor that it had. The staff was friendly and quick, but that didn't make up for the poor food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and would only come back if I was passing by.",1
"Overall, I thought the brunch at this restaurant was decent. The food wasn't anything to write home about, but the atmosphere and decor were really nice. I would recommend checking it out if you're looking for a relaxing brunch outing. However, I'm definitely going to be looking for other brunch spots that are similar in price point.",1
"This preppy restaurant has great food, service, and vibes. Been wanting to checkout JG Melon for a long time and finally made it up here. There was a long wait but Deff worth it. We got seated at a private 2 person outdoor/indoor spot and it was puppy friendly so we brought our pup. The place was vey clean and the wait staff was super attentive which was great.

I ordered the mozzarella sandwich for an appetizer which was really good with the lemon slice.

For the main I got the Bacon Cheeseburger as I feel that is where all the hype is for this place with cottage fries and she got the Turkey Burger.

The bacon cheeseburger was good Deff did not live up to the hype but was happy I got it. Prob try it again see if I was there on an off night.

The cottage fries were so airy and round and just awesome. I've never had fries like that.

The Turkey burger!!!!! WOW! This things was amazing! Let me say this again, It was amazing. The flavor profile just popped. I would suggest this to anyone even those who aren't Turkey burger people. Sooooooooooo good",1
Yes yes yes! The crispiest thin and pan pizza I've ever had. I am a Chicago Native and love Deep Dish but this may change my mind. The thin slices are about the size of my forearm. The pan is as big as my whole hand. Sorry Chicago but I fell in love with New York Pizza Suprema. This place has been around since 1964 so they must be doing something right. The line for pizza never stops and they are constantly making fresh slices and pies. They have free delivery and also have dine-in seating with plexiglass separating each booth. Both Andrew Zimmerman and Anthony Bordain have visited and eaten here. I am usually the last person to finish eating but it was so good that I finished before my friends got 1/2 through theirs. Go here and you'll fall in love with the pizza.,0

"I dragged my friends to try this place with me because I've only heard good things. We weren't disappointed. When we arrived there was a line but it went by quick! They require you to show your ID and Covid-19 vaccine card (so make sure you bring that with you). As you're waiting in line, they hand you a paper where you place your order. They only serve Tonkotsu and veggie ramen so keep that in mind. They allow you to get extra noodles but not extra broth. I didn't order extra noodles and I thought everything was evenly distributed. I also ordered the Premium Yakibuta, (Sweet marinated pork slices served on the side) they were pretty good but I wouldn't order them again. Kind of pricey for the amount of slices they give you.

The whole experience is really cool and fast. They sit you down in your own little eating area and next to you are other people but there is a small wall between you two. Sitting in front of you is a wall with a cut out where they bring you your food and drinks. The staff works fast and are friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone, to the people who are first timers of ramen and to people",1
"This rating would've been higher if our waiter was more pleasant and did his job correctly. For a super busy Saturday night, he could've made a VERY nice tip from our party of 9. But his horrible attitude, screwing up our drink and food order and then overcharging us for drinks just made it a less than enjoyable experience. The food was decent but the menu made it REALLY difficult to understand certain food items, like sauces or cheese that I wasn't familiar with. I wish there was a guide in the menu so that I didn't have to google things to understand what I was ordering! We started off with the amazing table side guac. We got 2 orders and between that and the extremely tasty salsa, it was a perfect appetizer. The drinks (when they were finally correct), were delish! We all ordered different margaritas and they have the full gamut of flavors and specialities based on your taste. I had a smoky ginger beer margarita and it was so good! We got Mexican corn for the table and it had a really nice flavor, and not on the cob which was good for our teeth! Most of our party got tacos, some got fish dishes which they raved about and I got the tres enchiladas. So the waiter said there was one chicken, one beef and one cheese with different sauces. He was only correct about the different sauces. They were ALL chicken, which was fine by me, I like that the most of the 3 but he had no idea what was inside!! We decided on not getting dessert because our dinner had run over 2 1/2hours and we had to get to our next destination. Not sure I'd return too quickly for Mexican food. Plenty of other places around with less hassle.",0
"The Carbone is a restaurant that is known for its overhyped food. I went to try it out and my friends and I were not impressed. The pasta was all very normal, replicable at home, and overpriced. The vodka rigatoni could hardly justify $25 to me when I can make my own vodka rigatoni that's just as good (if not better) at home for at least half the cost. The branzino for $95 was also questionable. Overall, the food was OK at best and I would not come here again.",1
"Overall, we had a pretty mediocre experience at the Ainsworth. The food was decent, though nothing particularly stood out. The waitstaff was a bit brusque and slow, and wasn't particularly friendly. The venue itself was nice, with a cozy and welcoming ambiance, but our group didn't really enjoy our time there.",1
"Ippudo is a pretty good restaurant but not great. The ramen we ordered was a bit disappointing, but the baos were really good. The miso akamaru ramen was a bit salty, but the staff was really speedy which made up for it. I would definitely come back and order something different.",1
"The original location of this restaurant is really good, but this one is not as good. The food is not as good, and the value is not as good. The service is good, but the atmosphere is not as good.",1
"I enjoyed this quaint and cute carriage house with a friend. The tea was good and it came with a tier of mini sandwiches, crumpets and desserts. I was considering this venue for a bridal shower but there is not enough space and seats are crowded. Service is good.  I would love to come back but I do not see how people can have large events here.",0
"P.S. is really a great spot. This as our second time here. I am fully vegan and mostly gluten free, whilst my husband is fully gluten free (celiac) and vegan at home. There were a plethora of selections for us the both and the food was marvelous. We got the brussel sprouts and the golden beet salad to start, he got the buffalo maitake sandwich, I got the Thai chicken sandwich, and he got the brownie and ice cream for dessert and I got the pumpkin mousse. It was all SO good!! We split the two burgers / sandwiches and we were so happily full and content, not overly stuffed...The first time we came was with my parents--one is a carnivore who is veg-curious and very interested in food preparation and the other a carnivore, but she loves vegan food and is herself a culinary mastermind. There were buffalo maitake wings, sandwiches, burgers, golden beet salads, and possibly some desserts... P.S. was a big hit!!!It's a definite go-to for anyone in the neighborhood, so speedy and efficient, and delicious food.",0
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. This place is super packed! We got put on a wait list. They originally said 45 min to an hour wait, but we were called back for an available in about 20 minutes. In order to be seated, the entire party needs to be present. Also, they don't take reservations over the phone so you have to walk to the restaurant to make a reservation in person.We sat indoors to eat. The interior is very cute! Very warm and cozy vibes inside. Ordered chai latte and cappuccino. Both were very good. My friend said the cappuccino was very strong!For our entrees, we ordered the bronte burger (with truffle fries) and shrimp pasta. The bronte burger was served on toasted ciabatta bread. The burger was super juicy and tasty! Ordered it medium, and it was cooked to perfection. The shrimp pasta was so good! The sauce was very creamy with a hint of lemon, and there were quite a number of shrimp in the dish. So many shrimp to share between my friend and I. We loved it.We also loved the crispy brussel sprouts! It is best to eat it when it first comes out. After a while of it sitting at the table, it gets a little soggy since there is sauce in the brussel sprouts dish.Thanks for a great brunch on a nice October Saturday afternoon! Definitely recommend!",0
"Boqueria is an easy & delicious place to catch up with friends over family style tapas. Laid back vibe and extensive menu with a combination of classic Spanish tapas and other inventive small plates. Ordered the bacon wrapped dates, sardines, patatas bravas, shishito peppers and meatballs - each dish was flavorful and paired well with the tempranillo! Make sure not to leave without an order of the Nutella stuffed churros.. such a memorable & gooey dessert! Would definitely be to try more tapas at this UES staple.",0
"Wow! Beautiful interior, great service, and delicious food. They have a great brunch deal - $35 for an entree and bottomless drinks! We loved that we were able to switch drinks throughout - we tried different mimosa varieties and sangrias. Our food was tasty across the board - I got seafood shakshuka and my friends got the seafood omelette and the salmon with poached eggs. Our waitress was attentive and nice, and when my friend lost her ring, 3 other servers helped her look for it! We were blown away by this experience and immediately made a reservation for a birthday in the summer. Highly, highly recommend!",0
"I had lunch at this restaurant around 12:50pm and it was a total zoo. People were waiting on pickup orders for 1-1.5 hours and many people cancelled. My food took 30 minutes to come out.



I ordered the salt and pepper pork chops with rice. It was a big portion but didn't stand out in any specific way. The rice I got was dry and hard too.



I also ordered a salted fish and chicken fried rice for takeout. It is also a nice portion and smells nice but has very little chicken or salted fish. Don't really taste it until you hit a big chunk.



The place itself is slightly nicer and more western in feel than other places but it doesn't really justify the long wait times.



Might raise the score if they get their act together.",1
"We went to this NYC night club and it was terrible. We bought a table and were approved by the GM, but when we got to the door, they charged us an extra $500. Once we got to our table, they demanded we order the minimum immediately which was $3500. This was absurd because no club has ever demanded that before. The old woman who took our order also charged us for 20 waters and 15 redbulls, but only brought out 10 waters and 6 redbulls. That was basically a $200 upcharge. But I can't prove it because I didn't think I had to take a picture of the drinks to make sure I got what I paid for?? The service was the worst. They couldn't even afford glass cups/shot glasses. They gave us plastic. This isn't a dive bar.",1
"Came for brunch on a Saturday with a group of 8 people and we are so satisfied with our experience here!!!!! Upon entering the staff gave us the most warm and welcoming greetings. We were a bit early for our reservation so we sat at the bar while waiting for our table to be ready. The server grabbed us in perfect timing to take us to our table.We ordered a bunch of dishes to share with everyone and everyone was absolutely thrilled with the way their meals turned out. The pav bhaji had chips in it which added such a great crunchy texture. Loved the spice levels in this as well. The lamb for me is the star of the show. If you know me you know my favorite meat has been lamb and they cooked it flawlessly here. Pair this lamb with garlic naan for the perfect flavor experience. So tender, juicy, and full of all the aromatic indian flavors! Cheese culcha was a crowd favorite - reminded us all of something like an indian pizza tandoori chicken was another crowd favorite - such a classic indian food staple. tasted so good! can never go wrong with ordering chicken tikka masala! overall we were all so happy with the food and will definitely return!",0
"We absolutely loved our experience at Soba Noodle Azuma! The Azuma Gozen is the perfect option if you are looking for a large set meal of a variety of delicious Japanese favorites including soba or udon noodles, assorted tempura, sashimi, seasonal side dishes, and ice cream or mochi. The cold soba and hot udon are both top notch (plus you can choose from 3 sizes of soba, all for the same price), the tempura is crispy and tasty, the sashimi is fresh and practically melts in your mouth, and the mochi is the ideal way to finish off this fantastic meal.

At $23.50 for this huge portion of incredible food, Soba Noodle Azuma is a great deal. The staff were super friendly and extremely attentive, ensuring that we were enjoying our meal (we definitely were). The restaurant has standard Japanese decor with ample seating, much of which was available when we arrived.

Overall, if you are a fan of soba or Japanese food in general, you must make a visit to Soba Noodle Azuma. I guarantee you will leave the restaurant very full and happy!",1
"My food was just ok,, but maybe i chose the wrong item. Pad something with mushroom, and then choose the protein.My bf dish, the chicken basil is actually pretty good.We went on Sunday night, its a small place with maybe less than 10 tables, wasn't full, but itt was one man show server, so service was a bit show. But the waiter was very nice, and i understand he was a bit swamp.Ambience was nice, chill and casual.Portion wise,entree was pretty big portion.I'll give it a try again next time i'm around :)",0
"I was not impressed with BCD. The banchan was plentiful and, in taste, definitely was a smidge above average. This time around, we had kimchi, marinated garlic stems, pickles, potato salad and spicy dried squid. My favorites were the potato salad and spicy dried squid. The potato salad had a touch of sweetness, thanks to the addition of raisins in the mix and was mayonnaise-y without being heavy. The spicy dried squid was perfectly chewy and thoroughly permeated with the fragrance and kick of Korean gochugaru. I'm also a fan of the fried mackerel that comes with every entree. The entire fish is deep-fried to a crisp which means the whole thing is edible--bones and all! My soondubu, however, was not so impressive. I went with the Doenjang, which should be a classic flavor, considering soybean paste is the base of all their tofu soups. However, my soondubu was just plain salty and excessively so. If it were not for the comfort of having something hot to drink on a wintry day, I would not have finished my bowl!

The table also went with an order of top",1
"Man, I cannot believe that I have not written a review of L'Express in the 17 years that I have been visiting. It's funny that I have spent about half of my adult life dining at L'Express for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and post-drunk feedings at 1am, 2am, 3am, you get the picture.I would classify this L'Express as a classy diner, mainly because it is open 24/7. In all of the years that I've dined here, I can honestly say that I've never had a problem with the service or the food. I will be honest and say that I have not tried too many things, outside of croque madames and beef tartare, on the menu, but I have never been disappointed with those items. Well . . . back in the day, the croque madames were served with two sunny-side up eggs instead of one (I'm just being nitpicky). In addition to food, L'Express has a very wide array of wines, beers, and special cocktails so there is a little bit of something for everyone. All in all, if you want a low key meal, easy meal in the Union Square/Gramercy area, this is the place for you.",0
"Doughy, soggy and a bit too greasy.Grandpa's and Johnny's on Dyckman are far superior. That said even crappy pizza is pretty good...so it's got that going for it I guess.",0
"Hou Yi Hot Pot was a great experience! The food was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that it was a bit more expensive than some of the other AYCE hotpot spots in Chinatown, but it was definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good AYCE hotpot experience.",1
"This is a difficult spot to get a reservation at and when resy sent a notification that I was able to get in at 8pm on a Friday I was excited. Checking in at this restaurant is a bit chaotic. They don't really have a check in spot and it's one of those restaurants where you come in and wait 5 minutes for someone at the restaurant to acknowledge that you are there. The complimentary bread they provide is delicious. Very soft and comes with great olive oil. To start we had the shrimp and the Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were good, but didn't taste particularly unique. The shrimp was served room temperature which was a bit disconcerting although maybe that's how it's supposed to be served. We then split a spicy red sauce pasta which was great and then a sea bass. The service was generally very good- would come back.",0
"I came to this restaurant with my dog Gerbert and sat on the stools in the front, which was so nice of them (so dogs friendly!). Immediately ordered the burger and two $4 happy hour dishes: the mozzarella and basil and the mini pork lasagna.

The burger is not your usual ketchup-livered burger. This ones got sophistication. It drips with a cheddar cheese I've never seen before - this melted almost frothy cheese along the edges and top of the burger. The bun is delicious, the meat is soft and fresh, the char on the meat is yummy. The whole thing is great, just not necessarily that gotta have it-kind of burger. It's borderline too classy for me.

The mozzarella and basil is so fresh and delicious. It's served at room temperature (like a good restaurant should!) and I'd get the full appetizer next time. The mini pork lasagna is interesting, but I'm not such a pork fiend so kinda bowed out early on that one. I'm not rushing back here, but it's a great plan b when your favorite restaurant is booked.",1
"I'm a huge fan of falafel, and the falafels here are my favorite! I always opt for the harissa falafel, which IMO isn't too spicy, and I add shug (green spicy sauce), housemade pickles (definitely get these!), and spicy peppers. The hot sauce and spicy peppers give the sandwich a great kick, and they're free addons! You just have to remember to ask for them at the register. I often cannot resist splurging on an order of their fries with saffron aioli. The portion is large and definitely big enough to share. I may however be known for polishing off the order solo ;-)",1
"Gotta say some of the other reviews are spot on, wish I had read them all before stopping by.To start? Overpriced Halal cart food. There's really nothing special or worth the cost, as it's basically served from a cart in the kitchen to your plate in seconds. It's likely sitting under a heat lamp or microwaved.So if you want fast food at $20-30 per plate prices (with smaller portions and no sauce or seasoning) then by all means you'll love this place.I did not. However, the food was slightly ... okay, without the price in mind or the painfully slow wait staff. It wasn't great, or really that interesting, but it did not leave me feeling like the visit was worth it. Again, a food cart would have been more flavorful, which I find strange but maybe they're catering to tourists who don't know any better?The one thing this restaurant does have going for it is that the interior is nice. It's got a unique charm, a little dark but inviting.",0
Del Frisco's is a steakhouse that is located on Sixth Avenue in New York City. The restaurant is known for its excellent service and attention to detail. The steakhouse offers a variety of ala carte items as well as a generous pour of wine at the bar. The steakhouse is a carnivores delight and is just steps away from Sixth Avenue.,1
"Often hard to get a table, but there is a reason. Enjoyed the octopus --crispy light tempura coating but tender chunks served with avocado and olives; meatballs have a nice flavor (a hint of cinnamon); zucchini cakes were my least favorite--very creamy almost like a croquette, just ok; and the hummus is always off the charts. This time I upgraded to El Guapo. It is the usual delicious hummus with a crispy avocado in the middle and a spicy salsa. Yum. The house made focaccia is so good too. The potato gnocchi cacio e pepe are also great. They have a gorgeous wood burning oven (and a chef) that does great stuff.",0
"I was disappointed with my meal at the Kings Highway restaurant. The location is clean and bright, but the food was bland and service was slow. I ordered a gyro wrap and mixed gyro platter, but the gyro was so bland that I couldn't even taste it. Some of my party members didn't receive their food until the rest of us had finished, so we ended up just taking it to go. They need to up their service and food quality if they want to compete with the Kings Highway branch.",1
"We had dinner at Korean Express, thinking it might be a little cheap considering you order at the counter and take your food to the table. It wasn't exactly cheap, although the  service was good, something which has to be mentioned. Rozena thought the MSG in the chicken curry was overwhelming. I can't say I could tell the difference between that the packaged Japanese curry we normally have. Not sure if that's a good thing. Probably not. The beef bibimbap is plentiful, with beef accompanied by an egg, loads of carrots and lettuce, bean sprouts and plenty of zucchini. It's a good dish, albeit unspectacular. Not a bad option if you are hungry but we have certainly had better elsewhere.",0
"I absolutely loved my experience at Jules! The venue has a great ambience and vibe, and the food is pretty basic but the drinks are delicious, making the $30 bottomless + brunch a great deal. The Kir Royale, in particular, is one of the best drinks I've ever had. The staff here is also really kind, taking amazing care of us throughout our meal. I highly recommend Jules if you're looking for a great spot to catch up with friends, celebrate a special occasion, or take a romantic date.",1
"I was really disappointed with this restaurant - the service was incredibly slow and the drinks were very expensive and extremely strong. The mussels were the only good thing, but they were quite pricey too. The yuca fries were also great, but the brussel sprouts were so soaked in sauce it was practically inedible. The bacon was over cooked and extremely chewy. I probably won't be back.",1
"The first time I tried mighty bowl I loved it. Food was great quality and loved the price for it. It came out super quick and I thought the chicken was really authentic and tasted great. However the second time I came here, I ordered takeout and was missing two of the items. Disappointed but still would come back",0
"I had a great time at Van Da! They have great outdoor seating with twinkling lights and a warm ambiance. The servers were very courteous and quick. We got drinks, the Tumeric Branzino (4/5) and Grilled Jumbo Shrimp (4/5). The Tumeric Branzino was great - the skin was crispy and it had a variety of toppings that came together very well. The Grilled Jumbo Shrimp was a bit difficult to wrap and eat - my friends found it a bit hard to do. However, the sauce was great. Van Da is on the pricier side, but the portions are pretty small and we all were full after. I'd recommend getting an entree and some appetizers. Overall, I had a great experience and loved the vibes!",1
"TLDR: 5/5 Did not disappoint. A little pricey and kinda packed but once you have your food, nothing else matters. I actually found this place in search of other places to eat at and my radius was way too far and so this place popped up. You always get a little more skeptical when you see a 5 rated establishment. You think there must be some kind of mistake. But it wasn't! Food: Spring Rolls (non veg): 5/5 - These were piping hot when we got them which is of course ideal.  They came with some extra little sides to compliment the rolls and boy did it make those bad boys pop even more! So delicious. Braised Short Rib Pho: 5/5Listen, ya'll did not have to go off that hard! Everything everyone said about this was true. For $17, I ate like a queen. The meat was tENDer and fell OFF the bone immediately. The broth was like drinking the elixir of food. I thought that would give me eternal satiation. It was one of those meals that didn't need anything else added because it would almost be offensive if you did. I don't know what else to say, get this. Vibes: 4/5 It was giving me hang out with friends to first date vibes inside. Very cute interior and not too small either. They also have a couple seats outside which matched wonderfully with the inside. You might have to wait however depending on if you want to sit inside. (We were there for quite some time so they did nudge us to leave. Personally, not offended) The ambiance did get quite well not as ambient, it got kinda loud given it was a Friday night so just anticipate that. Overall, this might have been the best Pho I've ever had. I'm definitely coming back. -Cooley Complimented :)",0
I see a lot of mixed reviews here so my friend and I decided to swing by on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated right away as there weren't that many customers. Our dishes came out pretty fast and for the price it was pretty decent! It's a really homey vibe which was nice for a casual meal! Honestly for the price I think it was decent. The dishes are pretty simple and the portion size is a bit small though.,0
"The Poke Salad at this restaurant is definitely a bit on the pricey side, but the quality of ingredients is definitely worth it. The salad is packed with protein and healthy greens, and the portion size is generous. The only downside is that the avocado is a bit small, but the rest of the ingredients are delicious. Delivery was on time and everything was neatly packaged. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious, healthy meal.",1
"I think if you have fairly high standards for Asian cuisine, this place is average. Atmosphere and service is wonderful, and the food is good, just not top-tier. The chicken skewers were okay, but the Ba Mee Poo Moo Dang was delicious - definitely a dish I would get again. The portions were small, but comparable to other places of comparable prices. I would recommend this place to anyone, but just not at the top of my list for restaurants to visit.",1
This place was surprisingly good. I got the Piselli E Prosciutto pasta and enjoyed it. I went in with some hesitation because I wasn't sure if the pasta would be al dente but it was perfectly al dente. The pasta itself is a bit thick and the cream sauce was thick too so sometimes it clumped together in the takeout container and it was hard to pick up with the fork. The combination of the ham and the peas was really yummy. I do wish the cream sauce had a bit more flavor but it seems like these are all very basic pasta dishes so it was enjoyable and filling. My order took about 10 minutes to be ready and it cost me about $13. Staff was very friendly too! They also included a wooden fork and a little side of parmesan cheese.,0
"Up Thai is a great place for vegetarians and those looking for a well-spiced meal. The food is fresh and well-made, and the delivery is always on point. The only downside is that it can get a bit cramped inside, but the outdoor seating is really nice.",1
"I had an amazing expire experience at this restaurant! We got there around 1:30 and only waited for 30 minutes. While you are waiting here, you can order cocktails to kill time. Also they provided menu at the waiting area so you can do your research for the noodles you want to order later.

Walk in to the dining area, they don't have a lot of tables and the design are simple, you can hear all the waiters will greet you with Japanese. Love it. Feel special lol

After we get seated, water, menu, everything's set. I ordered noodles and also their yuzu martini. The drink is so good, very fresh, and the noodles are amazing. The service is good, they are friendly and efficient. I heard someone will say that the waiters will try to push you to leave then they can service the next customer, but we stayed like 20 minutes. And they didn't cake to ask us if we wanted to check. I love it.

The price is not high and the quality, the service is really good!",1
"This is your typical sports college / bro / loud top 100 hits --- bar.   There is an upstairs and downstairs, lots of room to have a large group drink. The staff was nice. The beer selection was mediocre and the mixed drinks were standard. They play a lot of football/sports games on the TV so a good spot if thats what you want, but too loud to watch.Also the bouncer was v annoying on the way out; just kept telling us to ""move"" as we were on the sidewalk waiting for an uber, legit made us stand 30 feet away before he stopped bothering us. (Empty outside and not a ton of foot traffic)Long story short; if you want to drink with the bros of NYU, here is the spot. Not necessarily a bad spot, but just know what you're walking into.",0
Have known Victor for years .. Great host and truly cares about the details .. Great food and even better drinks .. always nice coming here,0
"I recently visited New York and had the opportunity to try out some of the city's most popular pizza spots. I was definitely impressed with Square Slice, as their pizza is a great representation of what you would find in New York. VS is also a great place to go if you're looking for something a little different from the traditional New York pizza. Village Sq is a great place to eat if you're looking for something a little more filling, and their hot honey is amazing. Overall, I had a great time visiting New York and was able to try out some great pizza spots. I would definitely recommend visiting if you're ever in the city!",1
"I was happily surprised to see Fieldtrip in midtown. I have been to their Malcolm X location, and the food was delicious. The food served at the Rockefeller location was tasty, but the portion was so small. I had the Fried Chicken rice bowl, and as you can see from my picture, the amounts were small. I don't remember being that way from their uptown location. I must have gotten a few teaspoons of rice for a rice bowl. :) I hope quality control returns to this establishment.",0
"The Folly is an excellent bar for happy hour and dinner. The drinks are strong and the food is delicious. The DJ is usually pretty good, and the specials last late into the night. I would give it 5 stars, but something is missing for the perfect score.",1
"For all the hype I expected so much more. The space was gorgeous, the staff was attentive and gave good service but I found the food beyond subpar. Had the steak and eggs and did not enjoy any part of it. Meat wasn't good quality and wasn't cooked medium like I asked. It was like chewing gum. The potatoes were terribly overdone. Everything was cooked till black and greasy. See photo for reference.My friend enjoyed her pasta dish so there was that.",0
"I came to this restaurant on a weekday and got their lunch special. You can get 2 starters and 1 entree for around $11 which is a really good deal! I tried their Shrimp Tom Yum soup, Chicken Coconut soup, Vegetable dumplings, and Vegetable Crispy Rolls. Both the soup taste okay, they're both pretty sour. I would not recommend the vegetable dumplings, you could definitely get better dumplings elsewhere, but the vegetable rolls were pretty good. For the entree I tried their chicken pad thai and chicken drunken noodles. Both entrees taste delicious! Overall, I prefer the entrees over the starters but the food is great for the price! I would definitely come back to try more entree dishes.",1
"I am so so happy I found this place! I was wandering around trying to figure out what I wanted for lunch and came across casa nomad. It's so cute and clean inside and everyone who works there is super nice and friendly. The hand sani at check out was definitely very much appreciated. And the food. Omg the chicken was moist, the curried cauliflower delicious, and the Brussels sprouts were really tasty. Def a fan and will come back my next time in the city.",0
I had a great experience dining at this restaurant last night. The outdoor ambiance was beautiful and really set the mood for a romantic evening. The food was fantastic - my favorite dish was the eggplant chips. The octopus was also really good - it was very flavorful and had a great texture. The service was outstanding - everyone was very polite and attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"The Urban Eatery is a great spot for breakfast if you're looking for something local and affordable. The seaweed rice balls are a nice touch and the miso soup is pretty good, albeit a bit on the instant side. The karaage was also very good, and the service was friendly and attentive. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this spot!",1
"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant, but unfortunately my experience was not positive. The food has definitely gone more ""authentic-sounding"" (in name alone), but it's the same sugary salty goopy food from the 1989s, only more expensive. Additionally, the food can be inconsistent - one day my hot and sour soup was dark brown and super sesame-y with zero tofu, had solidified-gelatin before I got home. The very next day my hot and sour soup was extremely sour and light brown with gigantic chunks of tofu and very watery. It seems like they came from two different restaurants and two different recipes. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of this place - I'm sorry.",1
"The diner is small, but the hustle and bustle is definitely worth it. The Reuben was delicious and really made me feel like I was in New York City. The place gets packed and waiting is normal, but it's definitely worth it for the delicious food.",1
"Restaurant on 2nd floor of museum of Jewish heritage.  Came for show (harmony - great) and museum.  Got there early for brunch. Service great, view great.  Food amazing  restaurant open during museum hours.Daughter had Huge delicious challah French toast. Son had significant- small but again delicious. I had ""red caviar blinis"". Wife had ""healthy duo"" egg and lox sandwiches.  Other than French toast portions were small, so also got a large bagel and lox.Note they have 5 types of lox. The two we had were great Oh,  its kosher too",0
"The Wayland is a great spot for drinks and dinner. The drinks are refreshing and the food is well-presented and of decent quality. I particularly enjoyed the Tequila Time Machine and the Hear Banjos drinks. The chef's plate is a great deal and offers lots of food for the price. The only downside is that the space is not very large, so it can get a bit cramped. Overall, a great choice for drinks and dinner in the city.",1
"Not a typical New York slice. Not terrible but not as good as a typical slice.Had some pepperoni pizza from here today.Pretty meh for me. It's ultra thin crust, to the point where it's too easy to get overcooked. Light on sauce, with decent cheese and larger slices of spicy pepperoni.  The schtick here is they give you sauce on the side to dip your pizza into. I wish it was ranch instead like at Gumby's pizza. I only used the sauce for the crust.When slices return, I will try the heritage sausage and al pastor by the slice and will be back to review those interesting slices.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying out this new takeout place that just opened up on the UWS. Unfortunately, my experience was not great. The chicken wings were dry and lacked any flavor, and the dipping sauce was also very bland. The Mac and cheese was also a disappointment - there was no cheese on top and it was very bland. The tots were good, though a bit greasy. And the waffle fries were fine. However, everything was cold and damp when I got it home, which was disappointing. The service was friendly at the door, but it was a bit confusing as to how to order. Overall, I thought this place would be great, but it was not. I would not recommend it.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ambience is really cozy and the lighting is pretty dim, which made it feel really intimate and welcoming. The small tables are perfect for a quick meal, and the larger table setups can be quite crowded, so be prepared for a wait. The location can be a bit hard to find, but it's tucked away down a flight of stairs underground, so it's reminiscent of some of the food shops in Japan. The food here is great - it has a wider selection of Japanese food than typical tapas found at a izakaya, and the selection of alcohol drinks is top-notch. The restrooms are available and clean, and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a fun place to eat with friends or coworkers and enjoy some good Japanese food.",1
Their chicken with chili oil is probably some of the best I've had in the city without all the bells and whistles of a fancy restaurant. I love that they made this dish available in a fast casual environment where I can just pop in on a random day and get it to go. Usually I have to go some expensive restaurant to find this dish.The cold skin noodles or liang pi is actually quite unique. More saucy than I'm used to and has a slight tomato flavor. It was quite addictive and refreshing especially on a hot day. I think this and the spicy chicken are a must especially since they're both spicy cold dishes. I also tried the beef noodle soup which had a nice springy noodle with very tender beef. The soup was okay but nothing special. I think I would return for just the cold skin noodle and chicken but would love to try some other menu items.,0
"I had high hopes for this restaurant after hearing great things, but I was a bit let down. The chicken was a bit bland, and the rice was just normal white rice. However, the pandan jelly and sweet sticky rice were both good. I also really enjoyed their noodle soup dish - it was a bit bland, but I added all the complimentary sauce and it made it much better.",1
"Little Park is the sister to the Dutch. While Andrew Carmellini has numerous restaurants, I sort of think of the Dutch and Little Park as bother and sister spots. The Dutch has more meat and less vegetables and appeals to a broader crowd. Little Park is the quieter, more veggie forward and farm to table. It is great for breakfast, lunch, brunch and dinner.",0
"Lil' Frankie's is a great place for some pizza and pasta. The pizza is definitely good, but not great. The sauce is a bit too loose, so the pizza dough droops in the center. The crust is also a bit burnt, but that doesn't ruin the meal. The spaghetti limone is divine, and definitely worth trying. The gnocchi are also good, very light and tasty. However, the tomato sauce they came with was a bit too sweet for my liking. Overall, Lil' Frankie's is a great place to go for some casual Italian food.",1
"I really enjoyed the tingly and spicy cumin lamb noodles! They were packed with flavor and the lamb was really tender. The noodles were soft and chewy, and it came in a good portion. One thing that was a little inconvenient was the noodles sticking together. This made it harder to eat, but other than that, I really enjoyed them.",1
"We had a great time at American Girl Restaurant! The staff was friendly and the environment was clean. We ordered the chicken cesar salad and grilled chicken sandwich and they were both delicious. The lettuce was crispy and the dressing was just right. The only downside was that the margaritas were a bit heavy on the lime. But overall, we would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Sold by the pictures, especially with the scallion pancake as a wrap! So my BF and I decided to check it out, but it was just okay. Its a small shop, cute decor but the food was just okay. The scallion pancake didn't have that crunchy exterior and the braised beef was too tough. But the tater tots is a safe choice :).",0
"Fusion tacos go against my principles, but then so do some of my likely votes in tomorrow's election.First up was the Japan Taco, starring shrimp tempura. Close enough to the fish taco paradigm, it help ease my inhibitions about switching away from the ""right"" kinds of tacos. The Cuba Taco was a nice surprise, not drastically different than carnitas, but the pork was certainly better than Chipotle and the orange was a fun twist.Sampling the most shocking-on-paper effort, I regret that my comments are inconclusive. I didn't have high hopes for the Italy Taco, but I figured it was a chance to be journalistic. To quote Roger Ebert's review of ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, ""I can't recommend it, but I would not for one second discourage you from seeing it."" Ingredients include shrimp oreganata, cannellini beans, olives and cotija cheese and oreganata sauce. Is there anything with wrong with these beans appearing here? It's not like pinto beans and black beans exist on tacos due to an iron-clad law of the universe.Returning to more familiar fare worked well. From the Classic Mexican Tacos sections, I got the juicy birria, which comes respectably close to what you'll find at the acclaimed trucks. I'm super-curious about the Local Tastes section, with entries such as the Italian sausage-laden Staten Island and the Brooklyn, with corned beef.So the tacos worked more than they didn't, and the spacious set-up and friendly service get the highest recommendations. And this fusion skeptic must commend Planet Taco for one category where it outranks the more classical players - as of press time, there are 11 sauces. I didn't try the ""scary"" one but enjoyed three of the hotter chile offerings plus a mild one with horseradish.11 sauces",0
"I had a really enjoyable experience at Pio Pio. The food was delicious and the service was very good. The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I especially enjoyed the music playlist, which was a mix of English and Spanish songs. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"The beer selection at this restaurant is limited, but they do have Guinness on draft as their namesake. The interior is nice and the service was ok. The waitress forgot some of our drinks, but they do offer flights for those who like to try things. Not my first pick, but I'd come back if asked to.",1
"The pizza here is definitely some of the best in NYC, and the line can get pretty long, but it moves quickly. The crust is always crispy and the sauce is perfect - not too heavy or too light. The only downside is that sometimes the crust can be a bit thin and the toppings can be a bit stingy, but overall this place is definitely worth checking out.",1
Came here to try something new. The reviews look great. Tried the set and a few add-ons. Bibibap is mediocre. The kimchi soup was disappointing. Tasted more like sweet and spicy soup watered down. The kimchi itself needs more time. The bbq meat we had. The seasoning for the flavors were almost all the same. There was not much differentiation between. The server did not tell us how to increase the flame. So our friend tried it himself and did not know how to do it. We bbq'd for 2 hours since the meat took so long. Which was my friends fault but also no one telling us where the switch was. The desserts were okay. Tried it. Not coming back.,0
"The atmosphere was good and the waiter was friendly. The zucchini squash was more like smashed squash, not much flavor but just some spice sprinkle over the top. The mushroom was really good. The trout was basic but acceptable. The chicken was there but I don't usually like chicken breast but it was not too dry so surprisingly. Overall, it was a decent meal.",1
"We never dine around this area so this spot was a pleasant find. Food was delicious and had an authentic greek taste to it. We ordered the chicken kebab and the lamp chops. Taste was great, nicely seasoned and well made. The chicken was nice and tender and my lamb chops were perfectly cooked. Delicious! At the end of our dinner we were given complimentary dessert - small pastries. We sat in the front room which was very casual sitting. From the host to our waiter we were greeted nicely. Over all Very friendly and accommodating staff. And the decor has a feel of bar/lounge/restaurant mix. 2 main sitting rooms and a large bar area in between. One room seems more formal than the other.",0
"I had a great time at this Georgian restaurant! The food was very interesting and the wines were great. The bread bowls with melted cheese and a raw egg were delicious, and the Chakapuli with white wine was a great dish. The dessert was absolutely delicious and very rich. I would definitely come back here and recommend it to others.",1
"The restaurant had a busy atmosphere on a Wednesday night, so I was happy to be seated. I started with the chicken liver which had a good flavor, but the milk bread could have been better. The appetizer was lackluster, but the main dish, the Snow Crab noodle dish, was good. The price point was reasonable. The restaurant is tucked away in Alphabet City and might be more of a curiosity for locals than someone looking for a good meal.",1
"Decided to do a sit down restaurant to get out of the summer heat, hoping we would be sitting in some nice a/c unfortunately it was not cool inside. We ordered drinks and one dish to share . Bill came to $70 so a bit pricey. Drinks were ok. We ordered the camarones cuzo .The sauce is creamy snd tasty snd loved the sauce that was put on the table before we ordered as an accompaniment.  I might comeback to try the chicken dish which seemed to be a popular item from the table around us. The decor is very unique",0
"Came here on Friday night and opted to try the 3 course food and wine pairing menu which was featuring a chef from Florence. The appetizer salad was okay, but the appetizer pasta was terrible and tasted like something from a diner. The main meals (ravioli and veal) came out freezing cold and tasted bad. They tasted so bad that we told the waiter we did not want to eat them (which I never do) and the waiter let us order entrees from the regular menu instead. The new entrees (ravioli and veal again) were better, but nothing special that you would expect from this expensive, nice Italian restaurant. The wine that paired with the meals was okay. Needless to say the only great thing about the restaurant was the beautiful ambiance and nice service. I really wish the food was better because I wanted to love this place and have it become a staple in my dinner restaurant rotation, but it just fell flat.",0
"I recently celebrated a friends birthday here. The ambiance was very nice. One thing that I enjoy is aesthetically pleasing businesses. The service was amazing, our server was always on top of drinks or refilling our waters, they came to check on us often to make sure our experience was pleasurable. The reason for my 4 star rating is the food was not as amazing as it was presented. The presentation was definitely on point. A few of us ordered several of the dinner specials. My biggest issue was there wasn't a variety in the food selection. If I could expand on anything, it would be to add more green veggies to the menu. The flavors were good. I just wish it was more robust. I wasn't dissatisfied, but I definitely expected a lot more.",0
"I feel like German cuisine isn't really sought-after outside of the Oktoberfest season. It was a coincidence that I was craving it during the month of October! I stopped in last night with a friend to experience the legendary Anthony Bourdain-worthy Heidelberg. There was a 20 minute wait for a table and they just kept on turning. The inside looked very woody and authentic. The wait staff was dressed in traditional German getup - suspenders and all. Our waiter was very prompt and friendly. I ordered a Spaten lager to drink and it was such a delicious brew. The beer itself wasn't even super cold but it tasted amazing. It was almost a shame to taint it with the taste of food. I had the Jagerschnitzel as an entree and it was so hearty and flavorful. The buttered pasta on the side was really good as well. My friend said that he enjoyed his smoked pork chop. We also shared a gigantic pretzel that comes with a delicious cheese sauce. We skipped dessert but I took up the waiter's offer on a schnapps. They had the longest list I've ever seen! I chose the mint one and it was strong, minty, and sweet all at the same time. It did settle my stomach nicely though after all that beer and food. I would totally return any day, week or month of the year!",0
"So this is the second time I've ordered from this place. Unfortunately, I don't recall what I got last time but I believe it was a half a pound of brisket.  I don't recall what it was like but I remember it being decent. For tonight, I got the pulled pork with kale and chili on the side. The pulled pork was good. The sauces were OK but I actually liked dipping the pulled pork into the chili. The chili was very good! The portion size was OK for the pulled pork. The kale was absolutely terrible. Bland and totally flavorless. Definitely would not get that as a side again! Overall, I would say between 3 1/2 to 4 stars but I would definitely give them another shot!",0
"The Covid Times offers a great weekend lunch experience. The wait was short and the server was very thorough in cleaning the table before getting us seated. The service was prompt and our recommendations for drinks were spot on. The food was flavorful and not authentic Mexican, but it was good for mexican cravings. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and thoughtfully put together. Overall, a great experience.",1
"I have never eaten at a vegan restaurant so this was a new experience for me.  My sister and I have tried several times to go to this restaurant but each time something happened that we had to cancel.  Finally got to go on a Sunday afternoon.The first thing I noticed about this restaurant is that it smells like heaven when you walk thru the door.  I'm hungry now just thinking about it.We both ordered drinks - I had the sangria.  It was good - I've had better but I've also had worse so all in all it was ok.  For my entree I had the portobello strips with sauteed broccoli and sweet potato souffle.  My sister had the ""riblets"" with mac and cheese and sauteed spinach.  So I can honestly say the food was delicious!  I tasted a little of the mac and cheese and a piece of the riblet and it was really good.  I enjoyed my food as well EXCEPT the portobello strips and my sister's spinach was luke warm at best.  That was a little disappointing.  The other thing is that the servings aren't big so I would suggest getting an appetizer - which we didn't so I was still a little hungry after eating my entree which leads me to dessert.  I was set to have a cupcake but was told they were out of them so I settled for the cheesecake with strawberries and my sister had praline ice ""cream"".  Her ice ""cream"" was very good tasted just like dairy ice cream.  My cheesecake was ok but was a little dry - not as creamy as regular cheesecake.All in all it was a good meal - I  would definitely go back.",0
"I recently visited Modern Asian Cuisine, and I have to say that the restaurant was very clean and modern looking. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and I was happy to find a soft drink fountain on site. The menu had a good selection of vegetables and noodles, as well as different types of fish balls. However, I was disappointed with the bland broths. The best part of the meal was the sauce bar, where I was able to find garlic, herbs, and different sauces to improve the flavor of my broth. Overall, I thought the food was good but the broth could use some improvement.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant on a friday night and it was pretty crowded. I made a reservation but the wait was 30 minutes for a table inside or outside was ready right away. The only downside is that the tables outside near the door don't have heaters and it can get chilly. I ordered a mojito and it was good. The size was decent too. Overall, I thought the food was good but I only had drinks here so I can't speak to the quality. The bathroom was pretty busy when I was there so I would recommend coming here during peak hours.",1
"I really like this place. Such chill ambience and the indoor seems so modern and contemporary! The place is connected to a hotel and apparently there's a rooftop there as well!! One star off for MIA server towards the end of our meal and overly salty salad. The food was good overall. I particularly liked the chips with the guac and green salsa, the smokey pina colada and the ribs (green salsa with ribs= the best!!!). However, the sauce for the shrimp salad was really salty for me, but the shrimps were cooked so nicely that overall the dish was still tolerable; although I had to eat them with chips to cut the salt flavor. The tacos were decent with good flavors. The ribs though, were ridiculous. Just the right amount of fat, seasoning and tenderness. They also served them with the delicious green salsa... yummm...Probably one of the better ribs I've had in awhile; and I'm picky with ribs and red meat in general since I was so spoiled in the Midwest and the south. My pina colada was creamy, not too sweet, semi strong, Smokey and yummy! Overall, would come back again when I'm craving Mexican food!",0
"I felt like have some pizza and my friend recommended me this place. I thought I found other my favorite place for pizza. Food(3/5)-I ordered mushroom with basil tomatoes sauce pizza for delivery. I like this place pizza but not the best. This place pizza was not too big than other places and enough tomatoes sauce and cheese. I didn't request them to extra tomatoes sauce or extra cheese but I thought it better I didn't requested them to that. If you gonna try this place pizza, don't extra sauce or cheese and please extra with any of vegetables or meat. I wish my pizza had more mushroom. Quite little of mushroom than sauce or basil. I got confused I was ordering just cheese pizza with basil. Dough was thin, not oily and very savory but little tough that it was a bit hard to chew. Service(5/5)-I ordered pizza for delivery a lot and I never seen any places gave me plates when they delivered. This place delivery your pizza with plates. It was amazing delivery service which's I never seen it. They delivered my pizza on time. Sometimes other places delivery late and it was just warm but this place wasn't.",0
"I've been to Pianos as a patron and as a musician, both upstairs and downstairs. I've seen it busy, and not so much and have been here on almost every day of the week. Its a solid music venue, wish the DJ was not so loud downstairs, but generally a good vibe, nice stages and always cool bartenders. Last night when I used my drink ticket, the wine bottle ran out walf way through the glass so they poured me a whole new glass in addition to my half glass. Very unexpected but they treat musicians nicely. I'll update for sure when I try the food eventually.",1
"Jacob's Pickle is a restaurant that I've been wanting to go to for a while now. I finally got the chance this year and it did not disappoint! The service was great, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was really nice. I especially loved the baby back ribs. They were so tender and fall off the bone delicious. The slaw was also really good. It was tangy but not too mayo'e, and it had just the right amount of shoosh oh. The potato salad was also really good. It had the right amount of mayo and was really crispy. The bread pudding was also really good. It was like cornbread and pound cake had a fluffy baby. I would definitely recommend trying this out if you're ever in the area.",1
I stopped by for happy hour while visiting a friend in Manhattan. We don't have happy hour in Boston so I enjoy the novelty (& value!). The value was great and the drinks were yummy. I got hummus and the lychee martini. I was pleased with both and our bartender was very friendly.,0
"All around solid brunch. They were really accommodating of our crew, despite our large size. Friendly wait staff. Pretty cool quasi-grungey, LES decor.The food was pretty good and fairly priced. Solid cocktails, and only $7 a pop or whatever.The food was good, too. My BLT wasn't the largest dish, but I really enjoyed it. All the meals around the table looked good.But will I be back? Nothing blew me away. But a solid LES establishment in a neighborhood flush (and packed) with options.",0
"The Harlem Tavern had a pretty poor experience with their hostess on MLK day. When we told her how many people were in our party, she seemed annoyed and assured us it would be a long wait. In reality, they were quite busy but not ridiculously so. The wait time ended up being about 45 minutes, which was about what she had initially told us. However, despite the wait, we were able to get a table and our waiter was really good. He was funny, personable, and made excellent recommendations for food. The food itself was good, but I wouldn't necessarily come back here.",1
"Happened to be walking by today and saw this cute little restaurant situated in the basement level and decided to try it out. Best decision I've made in a while.  As I descended the flight of stairs, I felt like I was leaving the hustle and bustle of the city.  The restaurant is lovely, and the vibe is welcoming and calming. I ordered the ramen burger, sweet potato fries and chicken skin. Man, oh man, that ramen burger was delish!  The ramen noodle buns were crispy and held up well till the last bite.  The ground angus beef patty was very juicy and topped with sweet teriyaki sauce.  I literally inhaled this burger and wiped my plate clean! The sweet potato fries were a great complement to the burger.  Perfectly fried, not too oily, slight sweet and crunchy.  The yuzu tomato dipping sauce was perfect with the fries. The chicken skin grilled skewer was interesting.  I mainly ordered this out of curiosity.  I thought the chicken skin was nicely done but could do with some kind of dipping sauce.  I imagine this would be fabulous with the ramen.I must also mention that the service was on pointe.  The waitstaff were attentive and service was quick. The prices are very reasonable, and the food is delicious.  I will definitely come again.",0
"The reviews were not wrong. They have indian and indian fusion with chinese cuisines. Place looks chic and service was good. Food was delicious. Perfect amount of spices not overly salty, which most indian places tend to be. Portions are not very big but enough for two people to share. We ordered two appetizers and a lamb dish and the flan for dessert. That I wasn't too crazy about. It was very dense and thick. However, I'm definitely come back to try other dishes.",0
"Disclaimer: I was invited by the owner to a complimentary lunch for me and a guest. Honestly, I couldn't love this place more. This is a small family run business. They've been opened for 3 years and almost closed twice since Covid! The owner was extremely friendly. The establishment was clean af and they have options galore! From customizable breakfast platters and sandwiches, to an extensive salad bar, to their longggg list of unique sandwiches, you literally cannot go wrong. It took me forever to figure out what the heck I wanted but I can't say no to prosciutto, fig and arugula. They source their bread locally and all the ingredients are natural, organic, and sourced from local farms. The sandwich was filling and came with a side salad. Delicious!The ultimate cobb salad was insanely huge. It had turkey bacon, grilled chicken, blue cheese, beets, boiled egg, avocado, tomatoes,onions, and piled high on a bed of greens! My momma loved it. . Their sandwich photos are insane. Also, xheck out my foodie adventures @saltandsavorStay hydrated. Stay safe. Tip yo server!",0
"Returned for dinner after unsuccessfully trying to get in at Hillstone; my friend friend and I secured a walk-in here instead. Started with the Tequila mockingbird cocktail, which was amazing, then shared:+ Whole crispy mushroom - I'll probably get this every time I come here, it's that good + Fluke crudo - another standout + Estrella (chicken liver pasta) - decent but not sure it's worth the hype+ Duck - good, had a really vinegar-y flavor though which is not my thing + Pear crisp - amazing, I can never resist a fruit-based dessert Next time: I want to finally try the burger, which is only served at lunch. 4.5 stars.",0
"I recently checked out this new 24/7 Indian restaurant called Bambu and I'm really impressed! The food is decent and the convenience is unbeatable. They're on Seamless so you can order and get your food delivered right to your door. And best of all, they're open 24/7! I can't wait to try their boba :)",1
I ordered the chicken bowl and it was good. The place was really busy when I got there. I ordered through the ritual app and my order was ready in 6 minutes. Will definitely be back to try more of theis lunch bowls.,0
Always my go to lunch spot when I'm in the office.  The bowls are decently priced for Midtown especially in today's environment - you can get a bowl between $10-$12.  I usually get the falafel salad and add in mostly all of the toppings that you can choose minus a few.  My favorite topping is their garlic whip - it's so light and fluffy but yet still has that garlic flavor. Love spreading the whip on the pita bread that they give on the side.  During lunch hours there's usually a long line but it goes by quick (or so it seems) - I usually order my lunch online ahead of time for pickup.  I come here at least once a week to get my Naya fix.,0
"I went to Benson's to watch the second half of the Women's World Cup and was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere. There was only one TV, but it was in a great environment with about 10 people watching. I had the avocado smash ($15) and it was so yummy - filled with avocado, poached eggs, and greens. I also enjoyed their draft stout for $6. Dave the server was wonderful and gave me a 10% check-in discount. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area.",1
"During the holidays we visited family in New York City and stayed at the Arlo hotel  in Soho The room rate for New York was extremely reasonable at $ 200 a night and included free gym membership A ""happy hour"" from 530 to 7 every night  at the hotel bar which included unlimited Heineken drafts or good quality red or white wine The hotel has a cool vibe  with people visiting from all over the US and also  many  European guests I met people from Austria and England while there.  The only disappointment was breakfast it's a fixed price $25 buffet but the selections are something that I would expect to find  at a  Holiday Inn Express not up to New York City standards Other  than that  the hotel was in a great location is impeccably clean and furnished in a very modern  almost Scandinavian design I highly recommend this Hotel in New York just go somewhere else for breakfast",0
"The service was so so so wonderful. Funny story - I had booked a reservation for 7 out of town relatives for a Friday night at 6:30pm. When I checked my reservation at 3pm the day of, I realized I booked it for the following Friday. I frantically called them to see if they had any openings for that same evening. Even though they were pretty much fully booked, they were able to slot us in that same day and only a little bit earlier. The front desk works miracles. When I finally arrived at the restaurant, the scene was lit. After work happy hour folks everywhere. Honestly, it looked like a fun scene and would recommend it as a place to bring coworkers. That said, we were planning to dine and we had a 6 year old with us. It was quite loud in the original spot they sat us at (next to the bar). At our request, the manager let us sit upstairs in the back. I'm so thankful for their hospitality and consideration. The actual food was good! Everyone has a great time, particularly with the shared charcuterie appetizer. I don't think anything was too memorable but everything was tasty. I would describe it as upgraded America bar food. Great option for people near the Times Square area.",0
"Da Claudio is a great Italian restaurant for quick, good food. The gnocchi was delicious and they provide generous servings of fresh bread. I wasn't a big fan of the calamari, though, since it was hard to eat (huge pieces). Overall, I would recommend Da Claudio for a quick meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The decor is really nice and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend it for a casual lunch or dinner. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded, so be prepared to wait a bit.",1
"Tip: it's very helpful to use the Yelp waitlist before coming here.Came here during prime brunch time and I got the French toast. The food was decent, not sure if it was worth the money given that we were seated in an area where you can grab to get food on the go. We kept getting our table bumped by people passing and going nonstop and it wasn't very comfortable. I don't think I would come back again.",0
"I had Nish Nush for lunch yesterday and it was very good. My meal was difficult to eat because it was very wide. I liked the dressings and the staff was friendly. I recommend Nish Nush for a quick, health-conscious meal. The pita bread stood out as being exceptionally good.",0
"I haven't been here for years but apparently they renovated the place. I missed how it was before where you take off your shoes and sit at a low table. I came here on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner with a group of 4 people. We ordered the gyoza, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, fried scallops, the Kobe platter for 2, and the assorted vegetables. I especially liked the takoyaki and the Kobe platter for 2. There was a lot of meat and the pricing is cheaper than Gyu Kaku Japanese Steakhouse nearby. I brought a cake from Panya (Japanese bakery) nearby. I forgot candles but they were nice enough to provide a candle, cake cutter, plates, and utensils after the meal. The staff were super nice. I would definitely be back! They seem to have daily specials and the deals were posted outside.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The plant-based fried chicken sandwich I got was really good, and I loved the bartender who served me. I would definitely come back here, and I'm looking forward to trying more vegan options on the menu.",1
"We are so lucky to have several good restaurants nearby that serve Indian cuisine.  Chose the nearest one for last night's takeout, and we enjoyed an excellent meal.  We've eaten inside in the past, so that was a sure bet anyway!

Last night we called and walked over to pick up our dinner, still hot and fresh.  The $18. takeout or delivery special is a great deal - an appetizer and an entree, plus naan, raita, chutney, and condiments.  The portions are generous; I even had some of my bhindi masala for lunch today!  My husband ate all of his chana saag (except for the forkful I had to taste, excellent!).  The long grain basmati rice is still fluffy and fragrant and I'll be able to incorporate the bit of leftover rice into one of the coming week's dinners.

Overall, a very good meal and a very good deal!",1
"I walked by and the window decor said no spicy tuna and no California roll when all I was thinking about was a spicy tuna California roll. With crunch, you have to have crunch. And spicy mayo, blasphemy without it. I probably wasn't going to find what I needed here, but I could be persuaded.When you just want a handroll, you need a handroll. Mostly when the pictures of the handrolls on Yelp look great too. That's how everyone does dessert right? It's like an ice cream cone of rice and seafood. We were seated promptly in the private dining room for the dessert round/last call on food.Others at the table watched as the first handroll arrived. Envied by all, I was granted the first bite of the night. When you just want one of my blue crab handrolls slow fed into your mouth. Inviting isn't it?Toro handrolls, too. Followed by a nice sip of sake. Our birthday guest at the table also got a hamachi handroll that I will be thinking about until the next sushi adventure. Time to ride out in our toy bamboo-leaf boat.",0
Loved the proximity to Hudson Yards and the great ambiance at this Mexican restaurant. Started off with guac and had prawns and rice as my main dish. The food was excellent and the drinks were good too. I took a star off for the rude attitude of the server. Despite me clearly ordering a specific drink she brought me out something different. I didn't realize it until I had a few sips and then told her. Instead of apologizing that she brought me out the wrong item she acted as if I had changed my mind. She took the drink away without apologizing and came back 15 minutes later with the correct drink. Frustrating and silly. It was reflected in the tip. Had she comped the original wrong drink and then brought out the right one everyone would have been happier.,0
"I was craving the rice noodle with curry fish ball lately and was glad to find them at this place! I tried going on a couple of Friday afternoons but they were all sold out of either the rice noodle or the fish balls. However, I finally got them on a Saturday morning. Definitely go there early in the day if you're craving the rice noodle with curry fish balls so that they won't be sold out by the time you get there. After getting this item, we ate them right away even though it was hot. The sauce was so delicious and it was the perfect amount to eat the rice noodles with. Can't wait to come back again!",0
"My wife and I did a quick city date on a sleepy November Sunday, and got lunch at Bryant Park Grill just as they opened. We ate in their tent, it was a bit too breezy to eat outside. The tent tables were well spaced, the tent was comfortably heated, and the space was filtered with about 6-8 filtration units. We were in there with about 2-3 other parties. By the time we were done, that number had about doubled - it was a good time to bounce.Service was attentive, if a little overenthusiastic. Hey, these are covid times, I think everyone's smiles are a little bit forced. Cocktail was tasty, it was called the winter sangria martini or some such nonsense, it was pretty much a red grapefruit cocktail. We liked it, and the food came quickly enough that I didn't have to order another, which is a perk of eating early, when your order opens the kitchen.Food was pretty good. My hanger steak could have used a pinch more salt, and the fries were passable, but you need more than passable fries if serving steak frites. My wife's grilled chicken sandwich came with a mountain of chicken, but no accompaniment, no salad, no nothing. Just a sandwich on a plate, like it was a steakhouse. The sandwich was tasty, but it looked weird sitting on that big plate.Costs weren't nutty, but I didn't look too hard at the tab. If you're like Michael N and are worried about ""expense account larceny"", there are places that are FAR worse ripoffs than BPG (Nusr-Et, anyone?)I've had better experiences at BPG, but I think they're trying, and I'll give a lot of leeway. The place was never that fantastic, but the location, people. Consider this - compare BPG to say, the Loeb Boathouse. Great location, but the restaurant? Meh (and by ""meh"", I mean ""closed""). Or Tavern on the Green. Do you see where I'm going?Would be five stars, but for the fries. It's steak frites guys, and potatoes ain't expensive ...",0
"Char Sue is a Japanese / Asian - influenced restaurant, located on Lower East Side.the interior is pretty eclectic and relaxed. tables are spread out mostly in the front of the space. the bar is tucked in the back. it's very much a chill hangout spot for dinner and drinks (beer, wine, and sake only). good for low-key date nights or group dinners with friends and family.**happy hour runs on several  food dishes and a few beer and wine choices. the happy hour reduced-price appetizers are smaller than the regular menu portions. Happy hour til 7/730pm**eats? good to very good and beyond.*the happy hour black pepper beef taco is  awesome--lots of flavor. little bit of kick. crunchy. and plenty of meat. $4 per taco. *happy hour pork taco tasted very good. nice variety of flavors. different from the beef taco, yet satisfying. $5 per taco*happy hour ""pooty fries"" aka asian poutine. crispy fries covered in asian spices and short ribs and topped with cheese curds. $7. very shareable for two.*happy hour yakitori bacon + enoki was good, but i don't think i'd order it again. there's better stuff on the menu.*entree: 5-Spice Short Ribs Rice Bowl. the short ribs and pickled veggies were on-point. good mix of flavors. also easy to share if you're not super hungry. $20. i added an egg for $2--worth it.happy hour beer options ~$4 and wine ~$6.the service is helpful and fast.drops mic cuz i am feasting on fantasTACOS!i outzzz",0
"AJ's Omelet had good flavor and spice in the drink and entree, but needed more salt in the eggs. The side salad was also minimal, but the fresh cheddar biscuit made up for it. Server was attentive and refilled our water when necessary. I would recommend AJ's for brunch but prefer their pasta options for dinner.",1
"The Dolar Shop is a great place to get your meal on a rainy day in New York. The soup can be a little spicy, but it's definitely worth it. The selection of meat and vegetables is great, and the wagyu pancakes are especially delicious. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"This cash-only restaurant is small, unassuming, and perfect for quick, delicious Asian comfort food. As soon as you walk in, they ask how many people are in your group, and then usher you to a table. The atmosphere is casual, and the waitstaff let the food speak for itself - delicious Asian comfort food. The menu is simple and straightforward, with only a few options per dish. We ordered off the menu and everything we ordered was perfect - especially the namesake dish, the Porkchop Over Rice dish. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, and was accompanied by pickled vegetables that really balanced the whole dish. The portions were reasonable and the prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick and delicious Asian comfort food fix.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The waitstaff were all wearing masks and following the CDC protocols, and they were very attentive with water refills and answering any questions we had. The menu is on your phone, and all of the utensils are wrapped and served individually. I loved that the menu was huge and had something for everyone (vegetarian, gluten free, etc). The only downside was that our table was on a crate, and it shook every time someone walked over it, but that wasn't the restaurants fault. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious, and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
I got delivery from here due to all the amazing things I've heard about this restaurant. It was good but they hype definitely disappointed me on the meal. I want to go back when they reopen and give them a true shot.,0
"I had a great time at Sophie's in Murray Hill! The service was really fast, and everyone was friendly. I loved that I always got huge portions, and the green sauce was amazing. I definitely recommend checking this spot out for your fast Cuban fix.",1
"I had an overall great experience at this restaurant. My friend and I came in for dinner and got the tsukemen, the veggie ramen, and the karaage. I was pretty disappointed in the karaage, which I thought was bland, under-fried, and kind of soggy. Neither of us finished it. The veggie ramen was okay, it wasn't super exciting (but it was veg ramen so I'm not sure what we expected). I know this doesn't sound like a 4-star review thus far, but the tsukemen...oh my god. I think this was the greatest ramen I have tried in my entire life. It was so garlicky and flavorful, without being too fatty or salty. I'm not usually a huge fan of tonkatsu ramen because I always find it overwhelmingly fatty. This managed to be incredibly flavorful without being too rich. The garlic was phenomenal. And, the noodles were ideal consistency. This was a flawless ramen dish (the veg ramen was a nice palate cleanser between bites of the pork, too).

Also, the service was great. Our waitress was very present and friendly! The atmosphere of the restaurant was",1
"Keepin it real out here in MidtownTried this place cause it's close to my work. Neat tiny little spot. Food is slightly pricey to me for the type of food served but still reasonable for Midtown. Got some dumplings and a pork bao and they were all pretty good. The pork bao is literally shredded pork inside a sweet bun (different from what i'm used to, with no other ingredients). Honestly after a while, I can't tell the food apartment for all the dumpling spots (this spot, Vanessa's dumplings and bunch of other dumpling shops). Also I picked up the food, and the dude literally handed me the food in a to go box with no bag. It's close to work so it's not an issue for me, but yea should at least offer a bag. Revision: Also just found out they didn't add cucumber (missing greens) in my Bao. Not cool....Peace",0
"Any time I see a 4.5 star place on yelp with a good amount of reviews you know I have to try.  I love the minimalistic decor in here. They don't try to be those typical greek places with flags everywhere and murals of Santorini or Mykonos.  The decor is toned down but it gives it that chic cool west village feel. It is also a spacious place unlike maybe west village restaurants that you are packed like sardines. Anyway, we had a really nice waiter who was from Greece and he made the experience very nice.We started with the revithia and saganaki. The saganaki was fried and a different preparation then you would normally expect.  It was also crusted so they had some sort of batter on it as well. I really enjoyed it actually. The revithia (chick peas) was a simple dish. It really is only boiled chick peas and I would skip it next time. The beets were also simply done but beautifully flavorful... so good.  For our entrees we had kleftiko and stuffed cabbage. Both were solid authentic dishes. The kleftiko is something you don't find at my places and is on the heavier side but hit the spot. The stuffed cabbage is an acquired taste for many but for me the flavors work. The sour cherry dessert is also authentic and delicious. Check out my pic of it!All in all, this was a solid meal. The greek wine we ordered was also spot on.  I would come back and recommend it especially if you are looking for an authentic greek meal.  It is a little more upscale than your typical greek taverna but who cares!",0
"What a delicious, reasonably priced meal we had in Little Italy. I ordered a side salad ($4) and sausage and peppers over linguini ($14). We asked for a bread basket, which our server brought out to us. Everything was phenomenal. The salad was nice and fresh (served with vinegar and oil), the pasta dish was absolutely phenomenal (good portion), and the house bread was nice and fluffy (perfection once topped with the salty butter). I would happily return, since I enjoyed my meal there. However, NYC is a big place, so I probably will not. My only critique is that the service was a little rough around the edges. Yes, I understand I'm in NY, and things are speedy, but our server rushed us a bit. He was nice enough though. Besides that, everything else was great. The atmosphere was nice (candle on the table, cute checkered tablecloths, clean bathroom, etc.",0
Such a great restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting so it's good for dates or a friendly get together. Service is efficient and friendly. The food here is always delicious. We got the cold pea soup to start and it was the best! My husband got the special lamb vindaloo pie and I got the fish & chips. Both were delicious. Cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. We've also been here for happy hour and the scotch egg was perfect. The beer and wine selection was also good here. Will def be back to try the other foods on the menu.,0
"Dined here with a group of 6 for a friend's birthday.Was disappointed at the availability of their food. I was super excited to try the ikasumi uni ikura soba (cold squid ink soba) after seeing it on the special menu and looking through photos on yelp, but sadly, they didn't have when we went. They also did not have the ice tempura (dessert).Ended up getting the goma soba, which made up for it. Our waitress had recommended it to me after I was undecided on the other sobas. I ended up really enjoying it. It has a really nice and fragrant sesame dressing on the side, which was the star of the dish in my opinion. Half my friends ended up really enjoying my entree more than the one they got (jar jar soba). For dessert, we got the special (yuzu cheesecake and matcha creme brûlée). Though small, it was definitely worth it. We devoured that thing in less than a minute. Amazing customer service. We did have to wait 2 1/2 hours for a table on a walk in basis, but the staff were all very friendly and polite. The lady who had made our walk in reservation tried her best to shorten the waiting time, which was really nice.",0
"They generously donated lunches to our hospital ICU staff in partnership with Feed the Front Lines. They were so wonderful throughout -- kept me updated on the delivery time/traffic situation, briefed me on the dishes, and best of all, the most delicious options that fit everyone's tastes. They sent us chicken and rice, chicken on pasta, and a vegetarian/dairy free curry rice. I loved my chicken on pasta -- it had the best flavor with just the right amount of kick. Everyone had positive feedback for the other dishes, also.So grateful and appreciative of their generous work to support healthcare workers at this time. COVID may have been around for a while, but the strain and exhaustion for healthcare workers is still real, so the morale boost is always appreciated. Can't wait to go try their restaurant in person!",0
"Washington Square on Jan 2, 2021. Although there's no inside dining we were able to enjoy out Sicilian and Caprese pizza outside at a table accross the street. The pizza was nothing spectacular but tasty nonetheless.",0
"Food 4.0/5.0Service 3.5/5.0Value 3.5/5.0Decor 3.0/5.0Overall 4.0/5.0Very good food, portions were pretty generous, and prices more than reasonable. Great option for a nice soba lunch. And now they're on the online delivery platforms too! Would come back.",0
"I had a month-long hankering for avocado toast so when a new Aussie cafe opened up in the neighborhood I had to come try it out.  My husband got the chicken sandwich and OJ. The OJ came in a tall thin glass with ice, making it pretty diluted for $6 that seems waaack. Fries were super similar to McDonald's which was exciting, but the sandwich was pretty bland in terms of seasoning -- maybe ordering an unhealthy option at a healthy-ish restaurant is not the way to go? idkI had ordered an egg (+$3) to come with my avocado toast, as did the girl at the table next to ours. Mine arrived without said egg so I asked for the egg to be added and received a side egg, hers showed up with two poached eggs on top :( y u no indulge my egg love sonnyboy, wouldn't come back.",0
"I absolutely loved my experience at this ramen spot! The ramen was piping hot and tasted amazing. The tofu was cooked perfectly and didn't come out oily or fried. The spiciness was just right for me, and I was able to enjoy every bite. The portion size was perfect for me, and I was able to finish the whole bowl. I definitely plan on coming back here!",1
small grab and go type of place right next door to Grand Central. seating is available for 2-3 people. staff was very nice and efficient. i ordered a seasonal drink: a rose cardamom latte with oat that came out to $8. great espresso but definitely not an everyday visit due to price!,0
"I used Seated to make the reservation (I was planning on coming here anyway, but decided to see if it was one of the options and thankfully it was, otherwise there would've been a wait). I got two tacos and my friend got a quesadilla. I got a margarita and she got the sangria. Good food and priced fairly. Would come again if I'm around there again.",0
"I came to try something new at this restaurant and the reviews looked great - unfortunately, my experience wasn't as great. The set I tried wasn't very good - the Bibibap wasn't very flavorful and the kimchi soup was disappointing. The kimchi itself needed more time to really taste good. The bbq meat we had was also disappointing - the seasoning for the flavors were almost all the same, and there wasn't much differentiation between them. The server didn't tell us how to increase the flame on our bbq, so my friend had to try it himself and wasn't very familiar with the process - which was his own fault. The desserts were okay - but I didn't particularly enjoy them, so I didn't come back.",1
"I made a reservation at Keens for my husband's birthday and he loved it! I specifically requested to have happy birthday written on his dessert and they did not forget!My husband and I tried their Mulled Wine since it was a cold windy night. The wine was warm, flavorful, and subtly sweet...basically a warm sangria!Their Butter Lettuce House Salad was light and refreshing and better than your traditional Caesar Salad.The Thick Cut Bacon appetizer was huge. You get three pieces and it's definitely enough to share for the table.Their Hash Brown was more of a baked mashed potato. It was good but it wasn't anything special. The Porterhouse for Two was nicely done. We requested it to be cooked Medium and it came out just right. The best part was the Keens' Coffee Cantata! We wanted dessert but didn't want anything too big. The ice cream sundae was generous on the fudge and whipped cream. We ate every last bit of it!",0
"I really really fell in love with this place last night!! Came here for drinks before seeing Jerry Seinfeld at The Beacon Theater because it's right next door. My review is solely based on their drinks and they were fantastic! Our bartender was a very sweet guy with tattoos wearing a hat with ""BOY"" in glitter. I told him I wanted the frozen Paloma drinK (order it and thank me later) but also wanted something spicy. He suggested a jalapeño tequila floater on the frozen Paloma + a spicy rim. How awesome right?! My friends ordered the chips and guac + salsa which looked amazing but I didn't have any because I was still full from lunch. Coming back here ASAP!",0
"My friends and I went here spontaneously for dinner as there is a nice offering of ceviche and Peruvian food. We shared the classic ceviche, chicken empanadas, and lomo saltado.Food is decent overall, just that the portions are a bit small for the price and quality is not super amazing to justify such small portions. The classic ceviche is fresh but it was a very small amount of fish with a large portion of Inca corn, which is not too sweet but makes a nice pairing with the ceviche. The chicken empanadas are good in itself, even better with the yellow and green sauces they provided (it wasn't spicy at all!) The lomo saltado is pretty good: the beef so tender and juicy, with flavorful onions and fries on the side. It's not too salty which is great compared to other lomo saltados I have tried in the past.Service is pretty good unlike what other reviews say. It's just a little hands off but we got what we needed in a timely manner.",0
"Was looking for a quick eats option in the area, and searched this little spot crammed away along West 4th Street. Only a couple of stools inside and a bench outside, this outpost is reminiscent of most Mexican street carts you'll find in the city (but indoors).Menu is straightforward and plenty of options to choose from. Settled on one Carne Asada Taco ($3.80 including tax). Food comes out within a few minutes, including the works of lettuce, salsa, guac, and a lime (unfortunately cheese is extra). taco is thankfully double wrapped as ingredients are spilling out as soon as you take a bite. Liked the flavor of the salsa and guacamole, and while the meat is generous there wasn't much flavor in the steak itself. For a quick grab and go, you could do worse in the area. Keep as an option if you see lines elsewhere.",0
"WARNING: Prepackaged food from a *Chinese/Asian* supermarket served to you with restaurant pricing. I am confused with the high ratings for this place. Based on the reviews and lack of seatings in other nearby restaurants, I decided to pop in here with some friends on a Friday night. Aside from cute signage, everything else just went extremely bad. Tonkotsu Ramen ($13): $0.33 ramen you can purchase at the supermarket topped with a sad limped cabbage and literally melt-in-your-mouth char siew (and not in a good way). The flavor of the char siew was indescribably gross. Reminisce of college school days when you living on a budget, but what angers me is that they charge me full price for a mediocre college meal. Tonkatsu, pork cutlet with curry sauce ($10): Again, another packaged item. Curry cubes you can purchase at the supermarket and not even the good kind of curry cubes with a poorly fried pork cutlet. Pork Belly/Bacon: The worst dish of the night. Not only was the pork belly overly dry and burnt making this dish entirely inedible. Needless to say, I would never be returning. I am offended by the audacity of this ""restaurant"" serving packaged food.",0
"Ordered the una don and green tea mochi. The food is normal, not very special but still good food. The table was close to other the neighbors and there we're a queue like 7 pm.",0
"I ordered delivery from here and I really enjoyed the food. My favorite dish was the kale salad. It was a great mix of flavors and the portions were really big. The only downside was that the cauliflower was a bit oily, but overall it was a great meal. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"The ramen is alright, had their signature it basically only has pork and spinach as topping for $15, doesn't include egg, or bamboo shoot or anything else. Soup is basic, not very rich. Had better ramen in the area for a cheaper price Service is fast and they have couple tables outside. Took advantage of their happy hour for $4 beer.",0
"Great ramen and good value for the portion size. Plus, the way they package food to go is perfect. I had the classic ramen and for carry out on a Sunday evening it was ready in around 30 minutes. They package the ramen thoughtfully with a tall container holding the broth while a bowl has the noodles and other toppings. So you can easily pour the broth on the noodles. Some places do not give large enough containers to mix everything so I really appreciate this detail. The classic had good flavor and the pork was really tender. I added in some corn for crunch. There was also raw onion which gave some bite to the bowl as well though I had some pretty big pieces - so that's really my only piece of criticism. Otherwise the meal was delicious, and I hope to dine in sometime soon. Everyone was very friendly during pickup and they had a steady crowd for a Sunday night.",0
"I had been seeing too many posts of this place's food so finally decided to try some on a Friday night. We made a reservation but still had to wait a bit once we arrived. Due to being a group of six, we got seated kind of in the corner which really only let us see one television, which was unfortunate during the first rounds of March madness. For drinks we just did some light beer due to a special, and you know exactly what you're getting with that. Food: Wings: Very crispy and delicious but spicy tasted the same as mild. Tempura Shrimp: Huge portion, very good but needed more spiceMix and Match Sliders: Tried a few and really enjoyed most of them. Loved the variety. Corn: I always love a side of Mexican corn! It was good but could have been more flavorful.In the end, it was a decent experience and it's always good to have options above the run of them ill bar fare.",0
"Fieldtrip's midtown restaurant is a great find! The food is delicious and the portions are generous. I had the Fried Chicken rice bowl and it was quite a filling meal. The only downside is that the quality control was not as good as at their uptown location. I don't remember the portions being so small, but I am glad I visited this location and will definitely be back!",1
"Dim Sum Palace's Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), Shumai, Chicken Feet, Lo Bak Go (radish cake), etc. are some of the best dim sum I've ever had! The Mango Smoothies my boyfriend and I got were also refreshing and delicious. The only dish that wasn't great was the Xiao Long Bao, which was unfortunately just not very flavorful. Otherwise, everything else was delicious and I'll definitely be back to try more of their dishes.",1
"My usual favorite Deli didn't have many options on Saturday and so me and my friends look for another spot and ended up here. At first we were excited because it looked decent, there are a HUGE variety of options, and I tried a lot of food here and there. Apparently the price is almost double similar deli elsewhere, but at first I thought maybe they will taste better too, hence more expensive. Absolutely not. The meats (both chicken and pork) are kind of dry, the veggies and salads are okay but I'm talking edible (not better than other deli), the shrimp salad actually has huge shrimp with good texture but afterwards for unknown reasons my tongue felt weird and itchy. I know for sure I don't have seafood allergy because I've had all sorts of seafood literally all my life, but I know it might happen with old seafood that are no longer fresh. Afterwards I also feel a little bit nauseous although thankfully no vomiting or food poisoning episode. My friends also said they feel somewhat nauseous afterwards. For the price, the taste, and the overall experience, I really don't think I'll come back anytime soon except if I really have 0 option left and was starving. Plus service also wasn't vey nice",0
My husband and his cousin likes to come here for their Monday night special. They raved about it many times. I was expecting really good food. We ordered 4 orders of different entrees for me to try and only 1 of it was good. Everything else was okay. Nothing special about here aside from Monday night special price,0
"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant - the atmosphere is always cozy and the service is always friendly. The only downside is that it can be difficult to get a table, but it's worth the wait. I especially love their octopus - it's cooked perfectly and has a crispy light tempura coating but is still tender chunks. The meatballs are also delicious - a hint of cinnamon gives them a nice flavor. I wasn't a fan of the zucchini cakes, though. They were very creamy and almost like a croquette, and just didn't taste that great to me. But the hummus is always amazing - it's creamy, flavorful, and crispy on the outside. The house made focaccia is also a hit - it's always so fluffy and delicious. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant - I highly recommend giving it a try!",1
"The restaurant is pretty neat and the food is pretty good. However, the spiciness level can be pretty high, so beware if you're not used to it. The service was good, and the meat was of good quality. Overall, a decent experience.",1
"If there's one thing that you can say about Spanish restaurants, it's that they know how to make food that tastes amazing. From the jamon to the paella to the churros, everything I tried was superb. The prices are a little on the high side, but it definitely pays off in terms of quality. In terms of accessibility, this place is top notch. There's an accessible gender-neutral/companion/family restroom as well as accessible stalls in the women's/men's rooms. The only downside is that the seating is quite limited, so it can be tough to get a table. All things considered, though, I absolutely recommend checking out Spanish restaurants if you're ever in the area.",1
"I visited this restaurant with my family and we all had a good time. The atmosphere is family-friendly and there are plenty of tables. My favorite dish was the Meat Lover Pizza. It has tomato sauce, mozzarella, bacon, pepperoni, and sweet Italian sausage. The toppings were all very good and there was plenty of them. The only downside was that the bacon was barely noticeable and the Italian sausage was almost nonexistent. Overall, I thought the price was very reasonable and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The atmosphere was casual and the service was prompt. The food was fantastic and I especially loved the biscuits - they were the best I've ever had! The only downside was that I didn't get a chance to go inside because my niece was getting a little bored. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good meal.,1
"I'm a huge fan of the Fig & Olive franchise, but sadly this one misses the mark.  The restaurant itself is beautiful like they all are.  And the service was pretty good too.  But the food was not.  The menu is the same as the others but it's served sloppily.... it's wilted, there's not the usual care taken.  The app plates were dirty. It was painful.",0
"A great go-to NYC dinner spot for dinner with friends or a date. I hadn't been in years, and was pleasantly surprised that the food is still superb. Enjoyed the fennel salad and the rigatoni with meatballs (sooo good - had to keep my friends from stealing it off my plate). The people I went with got the artichoke, heirloom tomato salad, tuna spring rolls and ribeye and really enjoyed those as well. Topped it off with a great bottle of wine for a lovely evening out.",0
"Got delivery through DoorDash from here. The grilled chicken spicy basil udon has an odd taste to it - like they put ketchup and sugar in the sauce. The chicken also tastes really artificial. Also got the Taro dessert, but it's much denser than I thought.",0
"Mezzaluna had high marks before the pandemic, but in the past year, I have found the restaurant to be inconsistent. 

The good news is that my wife had a great meal there pre-pandemic. We were seated in the street side COVID hut. It was open on one side, but was plexiglass and there was music playing. The space was very echoic and loud. There was a waiter's station immediately next to my wife's chair. The staff would spray disinfectant about 6"" away from her head every five minutes. 

After a while, I spoke to the host about it. He apologized and it stopped. 

The chairs were uncomfortable and the small table was lower than usual. We were started off with some OK bread. Wine by the glass was OK. The food almost balanced the dining experience. The special artichoke salad was very good. My wife said that the branzino was among the best that she ever had. My heart said pasta, but my head said healthy, so I ordered salmon. It was OK, but well done instead of the medium that I requested. The space was not conducive to lingering.

My wife really liked the food.",1
Not readily top of mind versus the stockyard of other more famous meat palaces in NYC but Del Frisco's can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any of them as service and attention to detail are both excellent. No surprises here as the steakhouse formula is executed to perfection  - ala carte everything and a generous pour at the bar leave only room for the memory of a perfect ribeye bleeding out on my plate. A carnivores delight right off Sixth Avenue. Just go.,0
The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a vegan restaurant.,1
"The duck jianbing was pretty good - it was a little more moist than ideal, but it was still delicious. The cucumbers were a nice touch, and the whole thing was very tasty. I'm definitely going to come back here for takeout!",1
"Food: 4.5/5I've been going to this restaurant for years and it's always been one of my favorites. Located near the Canal Street stop, this restaurant is a gem in Little Italy. During my recent visit, I ordered mussels in red sauce as an appetizer, linguine vongole in white sauce and a spaghetti bolognese. They actually got the appetizer order wrong and gave clams in red sauce but it was pretty delicious. I was happy they made the mistake as I might have found a new go to dish! The clams were perfectly cooked and had a very generous amount of garlic. (I love garlic!) The linguine with white sauce was good but not the best. It tasted a bit bland and needed more salt. The spaghetti bolognese was amazing and made up for the linguine. It might have been the best bolognese sauce I've ever tasted! I would definitely recommend the bolognese!This restaurant is the only restaurant where the bread basket does not go to waste. Their bread is always perfectly baked and warm. It is served with a side of the most addicting olive oil/cheese/pepper concoction. I have a really hard time staying away from their bread.Service: 4.5/5The service here is always above par. There's so many restaurants in the area that these guys make sure you're treated like family. Everyone here is very friendly and professional. I've had one bad experience here during the summer but they seemed pretty understaffed that day. Ambiance: 4.5/5Cute little restaurant located on the corner. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Nothing fancy but very cute and cozy. Great place for casual dining or with family.Overall: 5/5Great establishment with amazing staff and service.  Their red sauce here is ridiculously good. I would definitely recommend you try this place if you're in the area.",0
"4 stars based on food only - Snagged an outside seat today.  They are trying their best but the table fan is a bit useless as it fell off our table.  There are multiple air conditioning units on the top floor on top of the restaurant that dripped water during the meal but at least it was hot out and that was a bit refreshing.  They may want to save some seats for walk in vs just reservations for inside - shouldn't punish people by putting them outside if they don't think 2 weeks ahead for a lunch reservation.   Ordered crispy tuna crispy rice, 5 tiny pieces to share between 2 of us - was good, but again very tiny.  Also had the 5 create your own set  - thought that would be enough for 2 people at the price of each roll, but it was barely 2 1/2 bites. We got the poke tuna, spicy tuna, ikura, grilled eel and yellowtail. Presentation was 10/10 very pretty and instagram worthy.  The fish was fresh and rice was soft and chewy as it should be.  Food and presentation on point.  Would recommend for that",0
"Han Dynasty is a classic Szechuan place in East Village catering to spice seekers, with trademark dishes like dry pot and tripe in chili oil alongside more tame lo mein and fried rice options.One of my friends raves about this place and has ordered their wings literally dozens of times on Caviar, so my boyfriend and I made our first visit a couple months ago.Dan dan noodles ($9) were disappointing-- oily, only a few bits of pork, and not very spicy. Overall plain. Dumplings in chili oil ($8) were unmemorable. I didn't feel like their indications of spice were all that accurate.Dry pepper chicken wings ($11) were the best of what we had. Great wings and perfect level of spice. I'd come back for these alone (or simply order in). Addictive.The atmosphere is middle of the road; I like the lighting and there's a nice buzz from the crowd. Asian lagers are reasonably priced. Service was quick.Overall I wasn't wowed by my first visit but I'll give them a few more tries as there must be some secret sauce here.",0
"I ordered delivery from here and only really enjoyed 1 out of the 3 dishes I ordered. I got the following:-pork soup dumplings: these were just ok. The dough was very thick and the middle of the dumpling just seemed empty. -pork dumplings with chili oil: these were very good. I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the dish. I would recommend getting these.

-beef with bok choy: this wasn't good at all. I don't get why this got such good reviews. It hardly had any flavor and the beef was mushy. It almost tasted like the beef was fried and then the sauce was soaked up. The texture of this was not good at all.

I don't think I would order delivery from here again.",1
"Ordered take out, most of the ramen was way too salty, flavors more suited for a dip ramen. Miso ramen, shoyu ramen, and curry tantanmen were extremely salty, though the miso ramen had a complex miso flavor. The mayo pork donburi was okay- creamy and rice cooked perfectly. Packaging for ramen works well- separate containers for toppings, and a divided container for noodles and soup. Delivery was delayed because the restaurant was too busy so ramen was lukewarm. Karaage would have been good if it wasn't steamed in its own heat in a sealed container. No sauce to accompany either. Quite expensive as well.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant and had a great experience. The counter lady explained the whole menu, even with a line forming behind us. The spicy beef is really spicy (I regret not getting the lamb(- oxtail was succulent and fell off the bone- They are kind of stingy with the meat- Noodles are thick and filling; pause- I added black vinegar, which was a plus). The turnover is fast...we were order number 50, they were on order 64 within fifteen minutes. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"We really enjoyed our dinner here, have passed this place many times and always seemed busy - glad we finally tried it!! So many Thai restaurants in this neighborhood, yet hard to find one we really like! Spice is indicated on the menu by a symbol that means ""mild spicy."" I like spicy, husband not, so we shared papaya salad but asked for it to not be mild spicy, and they obliged. It was fresh and crisp and delicious. I asked for my eggplant/tofu dish to be more spiced than mild, and the waiter wrote that down, but it was barely spicy at all. Next time I will be more insistent! My husband was very pleased, though, that his Lovely Nest, on the menu as mild spicy, came out as he asked for it, not spicy at all. Tiny place (hey, it's in Hell's Kitchen, every place is small!), but comfortable seating and good acoustics even when packed. It was obvious on that Saturday night that they do a brisk takeout business as well!",1
"This experience genuinely confused me. I came here with my dining partner because I reeeeeaaallllyyy wanted pancakes and I'd read the avians had good ones. The staff was fairly nice and accommodating. We were seated right away and given time to pick what we wanted. I originally asked for banana and chocolate chip pancakes. A couple minutes later I was told they had no bananas so I asked for chocolate chip and marshmallow pancakes. My dining partner asked for chocolate chip pancakes. We also ordered the chicken tender appetizer. Instead of chocolate chip and marshmallow pancakes, I received chocolate chip and *graham cracker* pancakes. So strange. They were alright. A bit dry because of the lack of marshmallow Instead of chocolate chip pancakes, my dining partner got chocolate chip and walnut pancakes. Even more strange. The chicken tenders were groundbreaking, though. Truly the perfect amount of crunch and tenderness. The honey mustard was fantastic and overall the highlight of the meal. Not sure if I'd return for the service, but I'd return for the tenders.",0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at Los Tacos No. 1. The tacos were overpriced and the place was just so damn crowded I pulled up on a Tuesday night with a friend, the line moved incredibly fast. I was so impressed. With a line out the door, I waited all but 5 minutes. We ordered two carne asada tacos, the cactus taco, an agua fresca, and horchata. I love that the tacos come with all the fixings (salsa, guacamole, onions, lime). But I got flour tortillas. The carne asada was really delicious; tender meat, a little bit of a kick, juicy guacamole, and petite. The agua fresca was refreshing but watered down. My friend said the horchata was good so I'll take her word for it  But what really put the nail in the coffin was the cactus taco. Everybody in the comments said it was good so I took a leap of faith but damn. I fucked up! Cactus was slimy, lacked seasoning, and because it was diced rather than sliced, the texture was just all off for me. I wanted a crunch factor or something to relieve me from",1
"I came to this restaurant after work, and it was on a Wednesday. It was your typical slow restaurant day, where you're the only other table there. I ordered my drink and my friend's ID expired, so she was denied a drink. The food was okay - I enjoyed my French fries and my enchilada. However, the soy wings were just OK. I had about two passion fruit drinks that definitely had no alcohol in it. If I'm in the area late and need food, I'll give this restaurant a try again.",1
"I tried out Song E Napule tonight and it wasn't really my thing. The crust was a little too soft and the crust was a little too chewy. The toppings were plentiful and nice size, but I wasn't really impressed.",1
"One of my favorite spots in the City. I haven't been here for a while, but this place never fails me. Andrew, our server, aced it! Pleasant, attentive, and gave a great recommendation for a drink.Appetizer: steak tartar. Yumm!! We had the skirt steak, special of the day. Lucky for me :) it was made to perfection. And since I don't like any sauces on my steak I asked it will be all on the side. It came on a separate plate with the Chimichuri sauce, shallots, carrots and roasted/fried hot peppers. It was delicious on its own. Ginger martini was delicious. I had two, thank you  The drink special was Cognac sangria. It was interesting. You could smell the Cognac but the flavor was dominated by the red wine. Than Andrew recommended a local dark beer. It was a perfect match for the steak. For dessert we had Creme' brûlée which was perfectly crispy on top and rich, silky inside. I love this place. Don't know why I didn't review it before and don't know why I haven't been here for so long. My bad. Hopefully... will be back soon!",0
"This restaurant may be decent for some, but I found it to be Bland and not worth the price. The chicken was dry and lacked flavor, and the sides were also not very good. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"The food at this restaurant was not great. Although the pan fried chive dumpling was enjoyable, the rest of the food was greasy and soft. The service was good, however.",1
"Got them mixed meat don for delivery and got food poisoned the same night. The char shiu tasted bland, the clam and ground meat is only spicy without much other flavor. I felt I can't digest the food well after eating it. The longer after I had the food, the worse I felt. Eventually at night I puked them all out.",0
The $1.00 per slice of cheese pizza is a great deal in Times Square. The staff are friendly and the pizza is ok - it's New York Style  thin crust with a very thin layer of cheese. The quality is average for the price paid. It's worth to visit especially for on the go and on the run snacking and quick bites.,1
"I've only been to this place when they had a live band. With the band, it's extra enjoyable, so really it should get an extra star for atmosphere when there is a band. No cover! There is a small floor for dancing. So if not dancing, you can just watch and enjoy your beer and/or meal.They have a decently priced beer that comes in a boot. Highly recommended as the boot glass is adorable. Also, I've had there spiked apple cider with Jack Daniels. Mmm.. They have a big pretzel with spicy or sweet mustard. 50% off discount on Yelp for the big pretzel. Had tried their chicken wings, latkas and biercheese dip. I recommend the biercheese dip and chips. The chips are potato pieces. The chicken wings were okay, not too impressive. The potato latkas were good. Highly recommended. Overall, it's a decent bar.",0
"This place is great! I came here with my vegan friend and it is delicious. It is vegan fast food, and I would consider it a restaurant. It was super tasty and I am not even vegan. I am highly impressed and it was actually super busy for a vegan restaurant in NYC! Which was impressive. I loved the buffalo wings I got and the mac and cheese. The cauliflower was delicious as well. They have a variety of drinks as well! I highly recommend. The only downside is it is pretty pricey and I wish the portions were bigger. I would come again!",1
"I feel like it's hard to come across a decent place for traditional Korean food, so I was excited when my friend took us here for dinner. We came on a weekday evening and the wait was about 10-15 minutes. We were seated and served warm barley tea and various banchans. I was definitely impressed by the variety and taste of the banchans, especially the homemade tofu. We ordered the kimchi tofu stew since tofu dishes are their specialty. The stew was really flavorful and the serving size was generous. They also included mung beans in our rice for added nutrition. Our server was very attentive and brought us extra side dishes. At the end of the meal we had nurungji from the leftover rice. We ended up paying about $20 each with tip, which was the first time I've ever paid more than $10 for tofu stew. However I definitely think you're paying for the quality and service, so I would definitely recommend this spot if you're craving traditional Korean food.",0
"I think Dorrian's Red Hand is a great place to go for a drink or meal. The service is always great and the atmosphere is comfortable. The only downside is that they don't have a lot of drink options, and it would be great if they could update the board with beers available. The food is also okay, but I especially liked the breakfast burger. It was cooked medium well and was hot and juicy with a nice poached egg on top.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The steak was cooked perfectly and was definitely one of the highlights of the meal. The sides were a bit of a let down, though, as they were relatively small and not very good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would definitely go back. Just be aware that it is a bit pricey.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was great and the atmosphere was very tranquil. The service was good as well. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying some of their other dishes.",1
Updating my review to send a message to the manager. Please add the arugula kabocha salad to your seamless/grubhub delivery menu. It is only on ChowNow menu which I'm outside the delivery zone for. I walked 20 blocks to the restaurant to eat this salad as a result. Just hoping to gain the privilege of having it delivered to me. Thanks!!,0
"I should have looked at the food photos before going here. Was craving some good Southern biscuits & ordered expecting a cherished style like drop biscuits or baking powder biscuits but what I got was not that at all. The biscuits here are of cornbread consistency but without the corn flavor, instead just an unremarkable flour taste comes through. The fact that the biscuits order comes with a generous variety of different jams, preserves & butters just doesn't make up for the flavor & texture issues of the main attraction.Ordered the hush puppies as well, which looked appealing, as they featured a nicely browned, crunchy exterior with a soft corn & herb-flecked interior. However, the flavor was rather bland & did not pair well with the creamy dip accompaniment.Service was very friendly, especially given that I went on a busy Fri night. The menu options are varied & interesting. But unfortunately the food I tried was a big let down.",0
"Overall, I wasn't too impressed with my experience at this restaurant. I ordered my lunch and didn't receive any confirmation email, so I called them to ask. The person who took my phone call spoke very limited English and it was hard to communicate. After 20 minutes, they finally received my order, but it took over 1 hour to get my food (my office is very close to them). The Pad Thai was average, nothing special. The portion was huge, but I wish they could send me a notification so I know my order was received. The food was just okay, the delivery was pretty slow, and the ordering process was extremely inconvenient. I don't think I will choose this place again.",1
"Going to give three stars for now because it was late but I'm very underwhelmed. I've had great arepas before, and these just weren't it. The empanada was meh. I did enjoy the tequeños though. I knew they weren't hot because you couldn't get a cheese pull with the amount of cheese in there you should have. Because it was late everything was warm/cold. I wanted something, ANYTHING to be hot. We just tried an Arepa with cheese to see and the arepa was almost like stale and hard because it was so cold. I didn't care for the Downtown Arepa with short rib. The servers were very nice though. I went at 8 and it was pretty dead so I'll definitely give it another shot. Maybe I'll try another one of their locations instead, at a busy time so everything comes out fresher. They were also out of cachapas which I wanted to try but it's okay. Three stars because when you go to an establishment, you expect to be given good food any time that you go, despite it being late. I'll give it one more shot to pull me in. I was starving but I could still admit it was all meh.I DO love; however, that for every meal they donate to a child in need in Latin America. Which is why I want to give it another shot. Like I really wanna like this place",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was so cheap and delicious, and the line was never too long. I especially loved the pork and the duck - they both tasted great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap and tasty meal.",1
"I came here twice and got a totally different experience in term of food. It is a decent size restaurant with many sakes option. The service was good during both times. From the way they communicate with each other, it doesn't seem like this is open by a Japanese person. Still the food was way better than other restaurants around the neighborhood. Below are the food you have to get. Ahi tower - it was full of flavors. With the size of the tower, it was definitely enough to fill you up. Salmon Osaka - it is a half cook with torch, very tender like melt in your mouth with fresh salmon taste. Hamachi Kama - grilled collar of yellowtail fish. Eat it when it is hot or it might be fishy. All the combo sushi were alright. Quality was better than most of the restaurants but you are paying a higher price for them. Sashimi and sushi set of 8 piece can fill up a person. Then you can add up for your party size of which combo to get.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for dinner and was really impressed. The food was great and the drinks were amazing. The prices are a bit steep, but it's worth it. The atmosphere is great and it was really quiet when we were there so you could hear yourself talk. I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I ordered a pizza from this restaurant through DoorDash and was extremely disappointed with the results. The pizza looked as if it had been transported on its side because none of the toppings were on the pizza; all of it had slid to the side of the box. Aside from that, the pizza crust was extremely soggy and there was an overload of peppers, which overwhelmed the entire flavor. The pepperoni slices were literally tasteless. I wouldn't order from here for delivery again.",1
"Prince Street Pizza is a great option for pizza in the area. The line was long, but thankfully the slices were quick and tasty. The standout dish was the classic square pepperoni piece, which was flavorful and crispy. The vodka sauce slice was also good, but the margarita slice was my favorite. Overall, a great option for pizza in the area.",1
Went here with a Reservaton and the place was closed...  maybe i ll try it some other time and it I'll be open,0
"Stayed at this hotel for staycation for several times. Rooms are small but organized so I found it cozy. Bed is firm enough to ensure a good night of sleep. Remember to pull down your curtains cuz if your windows are facing the courtyard, people can actually see each other, like, clearly. Very front desk during daytime. But night time not so much. We ordered delivery but the front desk didn't give us a call when the delivery was here. When we went downstairs to pick it up, the front desk just stared at us without saying anything. COLD.  But otherwise this place is not bad, especially given that the price dropped a lot during COVID.",0
"I ordered this as a drunken impulse really late at night, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and price! Definitely will be coming back, I got one of the combos and it was delicious and flavorful",0
"The Indian Project is a great restaurant with superb customer service. The decor is bright, cheery, and very good, and the selection of beers is excellent. The food is also very good, and well presented. I will definitely eat there again!",1
"I'm disappointed by the quality of the tsukemen here. The broth was not rich and creamy: it was oily, separated, and much too garlicky. The noodles were chewy and a little on the overcooked side. The meat is no longer charred and succulent, it is flabby and limp.",0
I had a really bad experience at Makiiny restaurant. The food was bland and I didn't enjoy it at all. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,1
"This place is delicious. They serve an extensive and varied menu of Japanese cuisine. The ambience inside has a modern feel but is warm and well lit. You have to try their Udon noodles. It's perfectlycooked. Soft, chewy, and tasteful. The staff is also so nice and genuinely friendly. They accept reservations and walk ins. I would come back here again.",0
"Got a poke bowl with 3 scoops of protein (around $15) and enjoyed it for the most part. I ordered the 3 scoops rather than 2 scoops thinking there would be a good amount of fish in it. It's great that they allow a pretty good variety of unlimited toppings including premium ones like crab salad and seaweed salad. However, I was really disappointed in how tiny the scoops of fish were (I felt like I was just eating rice and the other toppings rather than a poke bowl with fish).  The sauces were pretty good (spicy mayo and wasabi Mayo) and I liked the combination of flavors. Just wish they can put a fair portion of fish in each bowl.",0
"We ordered delivery and really enjoyed our meal from here. We got the beef carpaccio to start and it tasted very fresh. To add some flavor we added our own balsamic vinegar because it needed something added. We then got the gnocchi with fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce which was also very good. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and the fresh mozzarella was a nice addition. The tomato sauce was a little tart but the dish was still good. We also got the fresh ravioli with meat sauce, which was also good.",0
"I had a great time visiting the natural history museum, but I was really looking forward to some good Italian food afterwards. I was a little disappointed in the selection at little Italy, but the gentleman outside the restaurant was really persuasive. The house wine was delicious, but the buratta and lasagna were really delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"Came here for a birthday dinner for a party of 6 with a reservation. We were seated quickly, but it took awhile for us to receive the menus or for the server to come to our table. Service throughout the entire night was pretty poor.We ordered quite a bit of food, but since they were only cooking on one side of the table, I wasn't able to get a photo of everything. We started off with the Beef Tartare which was a hit. I'd definitely recommend this! As for the meats, the presentation of everything was lovely, the portions however were so small for the amount we paid. Compared to other KBBQ places in the area, I don't think it was worth it. To top it all off, we asked for them to bring out the cake since it was my sisters birthday, and they brought it out to us in the bag it came in. Candles weren't lit, and the cakes were still in the box. So odd, but I don't see myself coming back here. I can't justify the price point or the ratio.",0
"I thought this place was okay. Went here with my friends on a Wednesday night. The vibes and the music (DJ) they had that night were great. We got seated in the lounge area- we asked the waiter if we could move because there was a weird stench that was likely coming from the bathroom. Sitting by the window was better. Drinks were pretty good and average price for the city. And food was your standard bar food. I ended up getting the 8th Ave burger. Nothing to rave about but just what I needed after having been a few drinks in. Wouldn't go out of my way to get here, but if you're close by and looking for a place to grab drinks after work, I would recommend.",1
I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch and was really impressed. The prices were reasonable and the food was great. The chicken pad thai was my favorite dish. The staff was attentive and made sure I was always taken care of. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.,1
"Wolfgang's will always be good is the tldr.Is there anything special about the food at Wolfgang's? No. But is it good, and consistently? Yes. Is it fancy to new heights? No. But is it good enough to impress a general audience, and is it reliable? Yes.That's what Wolfgang's is, and does so well. It is a nicer steakhouse that does everything consistently right. And best of all, they have many locations, and can accommodate large crowds with no problems. It's no surprise that they are a prime location for the finance crowd, as it's the perfect place to bring all your coworkers and flex on them...and have a good time of course.In terms of pricing, there is a lot of food for the price you pay. $70 might sound like a hefty price for steak, except it feeds around 2.5 average people. The secret behind this is that their steak is drenched in butter. Good? Yes good tasting, but not good for your health. It's Wolfgang's, it's a good time to leave your doctor on read.For wines, the list is huge, but somehow lacking in a lot of places. The trendy wines, you will find. The extremely expensive Petrus, DRC, Lafites...you will also find. But the area in the middle is a bit rough. There are quite a lot of overpriced $50-80 wines that go for almost $200. There are a few bargains you can find if you have a good cache wine prices. From my memory, the Shafer was only 2x markup, and a while back the Stag's Leap FAY 2006 was only selling at $220 at the restaurant, which to me is at least $150 a bottle retail so...that's quite good.When they serve you, they do so professionally, and almost swarm you to get hot steak fresh on your plate. It's a joy to watch, and highly coordinated.So in conclusion, is Wolfgang's the place to be? Given a crowd and a bigger than normal wallet, yes. It's kinda like a casual joint if it were $$$, if that makes sense.",0
"I had a great time at Malibu Farm! The food was delicious, the cocktails were perfect and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"Nice place to get southeast Asian food. They do Thai/Malay/viet so a mix of everything. The food is good, and the owner is super friendly. Family owned type of restaurant. Nothing fancy here, reasonable prices (especially for east village).",0
"Overall, I thought the food at this restaurant was good. The flavors and textures were on point, and the service was great too. However, I wasn't completely blown away by the dishes. The jackfruit salad was very sparse, with mostly papaya and a few shreds of jackfruit. I don't think I would find myself wanting to come back here especially since it's a bit pricey. The bottomless brunch option was nice though.",1
"I had a decent experience at this taco spot. The tacos were a bit pricier than some of my other favorites, but they were packed with flavor and very tender. The chips were also a bit bland, but the seating area was nice and shady. Overall, I would recommend this spot if you're in the area and are looking for a good meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The kale salad was delicious and the Luca pizza was really good. The only thing I didn't like was how the service was a little slow, but other than that I would definitely come back!",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Little Tong. The food was pretty good and definitely unlike anything I'd tried before. We got the Grandma chicken mixian, the mala dan dan mixian, pea shoots, & the garlicky tingling mixian. The pea shoots that we got to start were really excellent. Flavorful & perfectly cooked!

The broths in the garlic & grandma chicken soups were incredible. They make such a flavorful, complex broth -- everything is perfectly spiced and the garlicky tingling mixian really did tingle. It would have been nice if there were a few more vegetables in the soups. Also, the chicken was PERFECTLY cooked. I will say that I was not big on the noodles. They were very bland and had a kind of soggy texture.

But overall, the space is really cute, the service is good, and the food is fun and interesting. I really enjoyed Little Tong.",1
"I love delis, so when I saw that my usual favorite wasn't open on Saturday, I looked for another spot. I was really excited when I saw that this place had a HUGE variety of options, and I tried a lot of food. Unfortunately, the prices are almost double what I pay at other delis, and the quality of the food isn't as good. The meats (both chicken and pork) are dry, the veggies and salads are okay, but I'm talking edible (not better than other delis). The shrimp salad actually has huge shrimp with good texture, but afterwards my tongue felt weird and itchy. I know for sure I don't have seafood allergy, because I've had all sorts of seafood literally all my life, but I do know it might happen with old seafood that are no longer fresh. My friends also said they felt somewhat nauseous afterwards. For the price, the taste, and the overall experience, I don't think I'll come back anytime soon.",1
"The warm lobster Cobb salad at this restaurant is a great way to start your day or lunch. The lobster tails and claws are cooked perfectly, and the salad is full of fresh ingredients. The only downside is that the lettuce is a bit too sparse for a salad as an entree, but the veggie side is a great addition. The service is good, and the outdoor seating is a nice bonus.",1
"This restaurant doesn't seem like it would be sneakily, addictively delicious, but I was proven wrong. The chicken over rice is so good, and the rice is SO TASTY it's weird. The daikon soup is actually my favorite thing on the menu, and it comes with the chicken which is perfect. The staff is also really nice. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to my friends. 5 stars all the way!",1
"It's a no brainer for a quick bite of what NY is about. Square slices, though not your typical NY slice you think of, but are starting to become a norm in this city. Still a fair representation of NY pizza if you ask me. Pizza in this city just hits different and definitely on a different playing field. VS is a sort of new comer to the pizza game and are doing it right. Of course everyone knows prince st. pizza and they'll always have a place in my heart, but VS is as good if you're going to compare apples to apples with the square pep slice. Less wait times along with some more modern takes like hot honey, Village Sq is an easy choice to satisfy that carby goodness we all crave. Stay fat mother sucker",0
I had a great time at the Smith! The food was great and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great brunch experience or a place to take the family when they are in town.,1
I ordered take out from this restaurant and enjoyed it! The chicken enchiladas were my favorite dish - the green sauce was yummy! The rice and beans were also delicious. Loved the rice! Next time I want to try dessert I just wasn't as hungry but the meal was completely filling.,1
"I came here for take out and got the Pepper Boy egg sandwich. The food was out quickly and was very hot and fresh. The sandwich tasted great! My only complaint was that it was kind of small and could have used more sauce. The eggs, cheese, bread and peppers were all great! Thanks!",1
"I had a decent experience at D J Reynolds, despite the rainy day atmosphere. The wings were above average, and the fish and chips were also decent. However, the service was not great. The waitstaff didn't seem to have it together, but the fish and chips were good nonetheless.",1
"Gammeeok is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in NYC - and the best place to get seollongtang, of course. I came with a party of five at around 5:30 PM, and we were really happy to see that there was no wait and we were seated immediately. I ordered the seollongtang deluxe this time - which had a bit more meat included and a bigger bowl! The seollongtang was pretty good - although I kept adding seasoning, it was still a little bland :( but I guess that's how seollongtang is! The meat cuts were not amazing, and were a little skimpy, but the flavor of the soup was still very good. Something I have always admired about gammeeok is how freshly cut the kimchi is - they literally cut it right in front of you! Best kimchi I have had in the US. We were also visited by the owners (I think?) a few times, and they always asked if we needed anything or needed refills of kimchi. Overall, a pretty great experience. I would recommend sticking to the regular seollongtang rather than the seollongtang deluxe, especially if it is your first time trying the soup!",0
"I was really impressed with the pizza here! It doesn't taste like anything I've had before - it's really unique. The customer service was also really good - they were very friendly and accommodating. The only downside was that the pizza was a bit expensive - $4 for a veggie slice is a bit steep. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! It's a small shop with no seating inside, but they have some small tables that seat two or outside. There's usually a line here, but it's definitely worth trying or frequenting. The prices are affordable, the service is friendly, and the food is delicious - I highly recommend the bulgogi (not pictured). They also had some fun drinks if you wanted to pair your food with tea or juice.",1
"Really enjoyed my meal here and was happy to see that all of the wait staff were wearing masks and following the CDC protocols. They were very attentive with water refills and answering any questions we had. You scan the menu on your phone and all of the utensils are wrapped and served individually. I love that the menu is huge and has something for everyone (vegetarian, gluten free, etc). I do feel like they're trying to cram a lot of tables into a small outdoor space and our table was on a crate so it shook every time someone walked over it but that isn't necessarily the restaurants fault. Overall, the food was fresh, hot, delicious, and reasonably priced - definitely recommend!",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for dinner and I was really happy with the experience. The establishment is clean and following social distancing guidelines. Menus are all mobile, hand sanitizer is provided on each table. There is constant cleaning being done and everyone is wearing mask. The drinks were $13 and up and super delicious and strong! The empanadas were amazing - I tried the shrimp and cheese options. Portions are generous, flavorful and very fresh. I plan on returning for their brunch soon.",1
"This place looks small, but there is additional seating downstairs. When we arrived, the main floor was packed, so we were escorted to the downstairs sitting area. The main issue is that the waiters and waitresses are not as aware that there are customers downstairs, so we felt neglected throughout the meal. Service in Chinese restaurants is supposed to be hands-off, but neglecting service is not ok. We spend 90 minutes here when it would have been less than 45 minutes just because no one comes down regularly. Someone in our group had to almost go up before someone comes down to serve us. I shared the pan fried hand pulled noodles with roast duck, fish ball with meat inside noodle soup, steamed vegetable dumplings, and xiao long bao with a friend. The pan fried hand pulled noodles are quite chewy yet slightly soft, and it was very flavorful. The roast duck is pretty typical, but there is quite a bit of fat on it that I had to get rid of to thoroughly enjoy the duck. The fish ball with meat is okay, as it was not as good as I expected, and the noodles (same kind as the pan fried ones) are a lot softer than the pan fried version. The steamed vegetable dumplings are pretty standard, and the xiao long bao was okay. Overall, I was disappointed by the service and some of the dishes we ordered, but I would still recommend people to give it a try once and just go with the pan fried noodles if they want to know what hand pulled noodles are like.",0
"If it is not obvious by now, my favorite fried chicken is most definitely delicious, perfectly crunchy, light crisp Korean Fried Chicken from Koko in the East Village and on the Upper Westside. Koko is also known for being the ""Best Korean Fried Chicken with Soul"" and I agree. Koko also serves Bulgogi Bibimbap, Seafood pancakes, Gun Mandu (Dumplings), Parmesan Fries, Sweet potato fries, Crispy Garlic fries, Soon Tofu Udon, etc amongst other things which we've yet to try. Yes, of course, I will be back. Yum!

Koko is a cozy minimal decor with cute chicken posters on the walls, plus good music playing in the background. The staff is friendly and owner.

"This is a place where it's probably best to stick to a few dishes like the pork chop, chicken, & oyster pancake. I had the beef stew noodle soup and it was not good. The beef stew was on the dry side and oddly cut. Any tendon was hard to chew. The white noodles were ok. The broth didn't have much flavor.The wontons with chili oil were better but barely had any meat/filling. There's also a pork & vegetable wonton version that may have more filling, but we didn't have that.I tasted a piece of pork chop and it was decent. It is cheap, so I'll give it that.",0
"1 star for food 1 star for ambiance 1 star for service My friend and I ordered the soy garlic chicken wings. The wings were not up to my expectations. If you like more of a drier wing and a crunchy touch this would be your type of wings. I personally like more wings more juicy. My friend on the other hand prefer wings that are super crispy.I also order the Bulgogi, it was really dry as well. (It was over cooked) I definitely had better. Overall I'm glad I tried it.",0
"Ok, so it's quarantine so places that are still open automatically get a +1 stars. This meal had raw food  which is an automatic 1 star, so this is a 2 star experience. Let's dive in ...Scallion Pancake (3/5): Beginning positive, the pancakes actually have good flavor which was nice. The center of the pancake was undercooked but not raw. The sauce is rather sweet which I thought was fine. Vegetable Roll (4/5): Cooked through, crispy, and sweet. For a couple of bucks this checks the box. Hot and Sour Soup (4/5): Standard hot and sour with a decent balance of flavor and ingredients.Chicken Seaweed Broth Soup (4/5): It's some seaweed and chicken broth. Take it as what it is. Vegetable Lo Mein (2/5): This veggie lo mein is not only lacking flavor but also vegetables. Basically consists of lo mein noodle, a bit of vegetable oil, and a sprinkle of shred carrot and onion. General Tso's Chicken (3/5): This is your mall-quality General Tso. The chicken is sweet, fried, but not saucy enough -- and a few florets of steamed broccoli accompany this too. It could have achieved a plus one if there was any sauce to dress over this two-ingredient dish. Pork Soup Dumplings (1/5): So as eluded to, this was raw. Each dumpling has a tiny piece of raw pork surrounded by gelatinous broth. The picture does a better job of describing this than words can. TL;DR: If the soup dumplings were cooked through we would have ordered from here again (at least during quarantine).",0
"I stumbled upon this gem during happy hour and decided to give them a try. The menu had just recently changed a bit so I was sad to not be able to get the Cuban sliders. The restaurant looks a bit small from the front but they have a great space for groups and some great happy hour deals. I ordered the guac appitizer I do with it had a bit more flavor. I decided to go with the regular cuban sandwich and I was happy I did. It was cooked extremely well and though I didn't love the yuca fries they weren't bad. The margarita was mixed pretty well and was on the happy hour menu which was great. Not sure if they have flavored margaritas but ill definitely check next time. The service was amazing though, he was definitely attentive and made sure that everything came out quickly which was great. Definitely a must try",0
"My friends and I shared calamari, fried chicken, oxtail, and ssam platter to share. Everything was good, but I especially loved the fried chicken because its skin was very thin yet crispy and the meat was very tender. It went really well with their soy sauce. I also highly recommend the ssam platter as it's very filling and so delicious. Instead of just white rice, they served glutinous rice rapped in bamboo leaves that reminded me of Chinese zongzi. In terms of the portion size, I think 2 appetizers and 2 entrees is just right for 3 people. We could've gone for another appetizer but we saved our stomach for the dessert: honey butter chips with vanilla ice cream. IT WAS SO GOOD! They literally drizzle warm honey over crispy potato chips and it tastes amazing with the ice cream.I also got their watermelon gin and it was so delicious! The only downside is that the food came very slow, but I would definitely come back here to try more food.",0
Soo happy we came across this location. They have an amazing deal of a glass of sangria with a hot dog for $5. Food is yummy and beautiful outdoor seating!,0
"My friend and I wanted to grab brunch after doing a workout class around the area. This was only a few blocks away and had good reviews and pictures on Yelp.Upon arrival to the store, I almost felt like I was transported out of NYC. Since I'm not a tourist, I can't vouch for this, but it seems like one of those places that appears on TripAdvisor. It has a tourist trap vibe.Once we were seated, we were inundated by the waitstaff. Literally 3-4 of them came to ask if we were ready to order within 5 minutes of sitting. Others described it as amazing service, but it might be too amazing for my taste. We couldn't sit and enjoy our food or each other's company due to how often they came by. As for the food, the brunch deal was good. It came with tea or coffee, a cocktail and a meal. The food was ok. I don't think I will be going out of my way to come here, but may be a convenient and average option if I find myself around the area again.",0
"I'm a big fan of this restaurant. The pepperoni grandma slice is one of the best things on the menu. It's extremely crispy and thick cut, and the pepperoni is hot out of the oven. The long lines are definitely worth it.",1
"I had a great experience at Seasoned Vegan! The food was flavorful and fresh, and the decor is lovely. The one downside is that there are not many soy-free options, but overall I had a great time. I ordered their raw lasagna and it was amazing - definitely one of my favorite dishes! I also sampled the Nefertiti salad and the mac and cheese, both of which were very good. The Nefertiti salad could have had more toppings on it, but all in all it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend Seasoned Vegan to others!",1
"Overall, I thought the food here was really good! The miso butter clams were my favorite, followed closely by the uni noodles. However, I wasn't really blown away by any of the dishes, and there were a few things that didn't really hit the spot for me. I was able to make a same day reservation for 2 without any trouble. The place is quite small, though. One thing that I didn't particularly enjoy was the beef curry rice - it was a little too dry for my taste. All in all, I thought the food was very good and would recommend it to others.",1
"Had the cronut dupe because I couldn't make it to the original one before it sold out but it was disappointing cus it's so greasy. Luckily, they have a coffee/tea menu so I ordered a cup of iced tea and it helped cut down the greasiness and the sweetness but it's a little overpriced. I love their birthday cakes cus it is very sophisticatedly made. The cream is very smooth and milky and the cake is very spongy.",0
"I came back specifically for the dumplings, but unfortunately they didn't taste as good as before. The dumplings themselves were just ok, but compared to the amazing dumplings I had the first time, they were just average. Similarly, the kimchi tots didn't taste as salty as the first time, but I prefer my tots to be crispy and for me less is always better. Overall, the food was just okay - not as great as I initially thought it was.",1
"Le Botaniste is a unique and beautiful restaurant with delicious vegan food. The tap water is delicious and the Veggie Bites were nothing to write home about. The green pea hummus was, well...different? The founders were friendly and welcoming. I wish they were in Los Angeles, I think in West Hollywood they would thrive... for what they were offering.",1
"I got my order to go, steamed rice roll with mixed veggies because there is no indoor seating!!! They have a huge outdoor seating section but it does not have heaters, so unless you like eating in 30 degrees I suggest getting it to go! With that said, my food traveled really well and all of the sauces were packed really nicely so I would totally get this for takeout again. The rice rolls might seem plain but the sauces really make it, make sure you ask for all the sauces (sweet soy, peanut, sriracha) because the noodles just soak it all up and make it so flavorful and delicious. The noodles are soft and the veggies give it some crunch, for $5.50 I would order this steal any day.",0
"The staff was unprofessional and did not seem to care that they had guests waiting. The interior of the bar was cool, but the concept is not worth the price. I would not recommend this location to anyone.",1
"Boucherie is a restaurant that I have had mixed experiences with in the past. However, my most recent visit was a completely different story. The staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, and the food was absolutely amazing. I started with the Boucherie Old Fashioned (Buffalo Trace, Patron Anejo, Plum, Lavender, Lemon Oil) and it was smooth and delicious. For appetizer, I ordered the steak tartare (with capers, shallots, parsley, and a quail egg) and it was amazing. The quail egg was a great addition, giving it a bit of a kick. For my entree, I decided to go with the Boeuf Bourguignon. This beef is so tender and flavorful that I didn't even want to try any dessert. Overall, I had a great experience at Boucherie and I am looking forward to returning soon.",1
"Its around $6 per pound...but I underestimated the weight of some of the food. I ended up spending $20. I got the jerk chicken, two different types of rice, collared greens, fried chicken, bbq chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, a bit of fried fish, and potatoes. For the amount I got, I think the price should have been $13 or so but it is what it is. The food is a hit or miss. The rice with the beans and the jerk chicken were amazing. Id definitely get those again. The fried chicken wasnt that fresh but after, I bought the fried chicken again and it was MUCH better.I did not like the collard greens or the bbq chicken. The mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, potatoes, and fried fish were average. I'd recommend just getting the fried chicken, jerk chicken, and the bean rice.",0
I really enjoyed my visit here. I give 5 stars for the food. The vegan calamari is delicious. They have a good size menu and a variety of items to choose from. A reservation is recommended on weekends during busy hours. The service is hit or miss depending on the visit. Will be visiting again to try more items on the menu.,0
"-CONS-waited 30 minutes, even for solo dining -noodles are okay-not the best broth; there could be more depth of flavors-you gotta peel your own eggs and I hate peeling eggs-char siu was okay -pricy, even without the frills and toppings+PROS+customizable tonkotsu ramen bowls+servers are helpful, instructions posted everywhere +coat hooks behind you, bag hooks near you+efficiently run with the lit up seating chart, the forms to order+broth is still satisfying and enjoyable +noodle refill, why not?+ideal for solo dining when you want minimal human interactionI wouldn't proclaim this my favorite ramen joint, nor am I sure I'd wait 30 minutes again. But if looking for ramen nearby and there isn't a wait, I wouldn't mind stopping by. It's definitely a great place to try once but the price point and the wait for a pretty average bowl of ramen isn't worth it for me.",0
"Telio is a teli-no. Prices are absurd, and the quality of the food wasn't great. The service was terrible, and we had to wait a long time for our order. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
70s basement chic for 80s children hanging out well color me surprised and very pleased. Super cozy and comfy place to catch up with friends. Jazzy. Wasn't here for the food at all.,0
"I went here to just to get some quick Thai food because my usual spot was not open and boy was I surprised at how delicious the food was. I had the vegetarian pad Thai, green curry and spring rolls and everything was outstanding!!They also have a great lunch and dinner special. It's only around $16 for green curry, rice and spring rolls. They quality is really good and the service was excellent!!Instagram-@traveleen_gurl",0
"This was a really fun and unexpected restaurant. The small plates allowed us to try a lot of different things and share our thoughts about them. Our favorites were the lobster roll and the octopus over rice. The steak and the jowl and the yellowtail were also good. The pop rocks was a fun dessert and the injeolmi mousse was really good. All in all, this was a great meal and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was 5/5, the atmosphere was great, and the service was excellent. My favorite dish was the Toro Ssambap and I would definitely order this again. It's the perfect amount to share between two people (but I would honestly just order an entire one just for myself). The Wagyu Ramen was also amazing - the wagyu just melts in your mouth. The Truffle Bimbimyun was also good but will probably not order it again. They do not skimp on the truffle!! It was just a bit too heavy and hard to finish for me.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"I was in the mood for a different Thai Place, I've passed by here a number of times and decided to try it. I got the Tom Yum noodle soup and Papaya Salad. The Tom Yum noodle soup was good, not very spicy but it was still good. It had a very homey feel to it. The papaya salad was good, nice and crunchy. Not too spicy with this either, but it was good. The service was also good. Summary: overall it's not bad, will probably stop by again in the future maybe.",0
I had a really good time at this Italian restaurant. Their pasta dishes are always well sauced and they have a good selection of different pastas. The rigatoni funghi e salsiccia in particular was really good. The pasta was slightly still tough but most of the pieces were good. The sausage mixed in was good and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet and savory. They also have good complimentary bread that's fluffy and served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar! I would definitely recommend trying this place out!,1
"Flor de Mayo! *Insert heart eyes emoji*Wow... How can one restaurant make me so happy!?The food is always amazing! During this (most recent) visit I switched it up and got chicken and broccoli and wow... I have been day dreaming about it since!!This place never fails with the food and service! It is like they recognize their audience and make you feel like family! Even with COVID restrictions, they are the VERY BEST!!***FYI-- I do not Like how they remodeled this location, but I guess I will eventually get use to it.",0
"Came to celebrate two friends who had just quit their jobs that day. The table bread brought out at the beginning was decent. They served it with a lightly spiced bean and olive oil side that was good, though I didn't quite get the beans and ended up just dipping in the oil. I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and the sauce was delicious but the pasta was too overcooked for my taste, something I was quite surprised by. All in all, this would have just been a three star experience but they threw in some free dessert and a cute little celebration at the end. Tip: bring bug spray if you are dining on the patio in the summer--they don't have any for customer use!",0
"Sapphire is a decent restaurant with acceptable service, fine food, and an average ambiance. The area is very nice (Columbus Circle) and the prices are a bit high, even for midtown Manhattan. There is nothing wrong with Sapphire, but nothing stands out either.",1
"Usually I can rely on Yelp reviews. You can't always be a winner in picking good restaurants. This was one that I lost . I picked this restaurant because my son is vegan and the had a list of vegetarian options that he could get what he needed. We started off with guacamole and chips. The guacamole was very bland.I had the Chef's special Chicken Burrito. The only thing that was special was the lack of Chicken in it. If I wanted a veggie burrito I would have ask for one. I have never had a burrito with carrots in one. Very strange. This burrito and whole dish  lacked in size. For $24 I want to walk away feeling stuffed. My son had the  California Vegetable Burrito. He said it was alright. Same price with the same feeling I had . Not worth the price.Sorry to say , find other options when looking for a Vegan / Vegetarian and a good Mexican restaurant.",0
"Since there are only ever two options and standing room that's smaller than my shoe closet, making the trek here can be hit or miss depending on what's on tap. The ramen tap.One time, I had a very mediocre lobster ramen by forgotten-chef-I-didn't-bother-to-remember. It had a good amount of lobster meat (so yay for that), which was overwhelmed by too much other crap going on--onions (dafuq?), corn, cabbage, cumin, butter (huh?)--I swear, my lost MTA card was probably in there somewhere, there was so much stuff. Chefs: Experimental ramen isn't carte blanche for you to just throw in EVERYTHING, then simmer for 6 hours hoping it all tastes good. It's not an effing casserole a tired working mom puts together on Monday night. It should have thought...and balance...and consist of ingredients that actually complement each other.

Another time, I had a much more traditional (re: better) tonkatsu that was filled with lip-smacking umami. So yeah, YMMV.",1
"I opted to try Sweet Chick brunch on a Saturday morning when it wasn't as busy as usual. The restaurant itself has a casual and relaxed feel, which was great because it was a good place to catch up with friends. Our food items were both underwhelming. The waffles were good, but nothing special. The chicken was dry and not very flavorful. The service was great, though. Our waitress was very attentive and refilled our water multiple times. Overall, I would say this place is your average brunch spot, but nothing too special.",1
"So happy we stopped by for dinner. The establishment is clean and following social distancing guidelines. Menus are all mobile, hand sanitizer is provided on each table. There is constant cleaning being done and everyone is wearing mask. The drinks were $13 and up and super delicious and strong! The empanadas were amazing , we tried the shrimp and cheese options. Portions are generous, flavorful and very fresh. I plan on returning for their brunch .",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at Soon Du Bu! The high quality of the food was evident from the start, with starters including delicious kimchi pancakes and a delicious vegetable tofu soup. The waitstaff were efficient and quick, and our table was seated within 10 minutes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great vegetarian meal.",1
"We had a wonderful time at Lox on Christmas Day! The cafe was very cozy and the service was excellent. The food was delicious, presentation attractive, and service was very good. The smoked fish and caviar dishes were of the highest quality. I loved the buttery challah and delicate blini that came as accompaniments along with fresh vegetables and pickles. My mom was still savoring her memory of how good whitefish salad was a week later, and my dad still dreaming about the delectable mon (poppyseed) pastry. We tried chocolate babka for dessert and it was rich and flaky, a perfect rendition of the classic cake. Unlike most Jewish delis, service was very good here. They enthusiastically accommodated all our requests. The waiter was a cutie. There is no cocktail menu but they have a full bar. I ordered a mojito and the chef himself brought out a gorgeous drink artfully arranged on an island of ice, with a generous extra serving that my dad enjoyed. A lovely lunch all in all.",1
"The people at this restaurant are so friendly and really try to please their customers. The interior is beautiful and full of lights and lanterns, and it really gives the restaurant a warm and inviting feeling. The food here is both traditional and fusion, with a variety of dishes to choose from. While it was decent food, I didn't find it to be particularly outstanding, and the prices were a bit on the high side. The enchiladas red chili sauces were really good, though, and the chicken taquitos were decent too with moist chicken. The blue card avocado salad lacked a lot of flavor, though, and I would recommend sticking to drinks and appetizers rather than entrées.",1
"I really enjoyed our visits to this restaurant. The fried dumplings and dumplings in soup are really good and we almost always finish drinking all of it. The soup is really good that we almost always finish drinking all of it. My parents also liked their soup, too. Their dumplings are big in size for the low price. The chicken with basil and pork with chives are delicious both fried and in soup. We were not a big fan of their pancakes. It takes longer for them to make the dumpling in soup than the fried ones. They accept cash unless you spend over $15 then they will take credit cards.",1
"Came here for lunch with little to no expectations, considering the average reviews. It is one of their many locations scattered throughout the city, this one is in turtle bay and mid-priced. The crowd is a mix of diplomats and embassy folks (the UN is close by as are many foreign embassies) , a handful of wealthy-ish ladies who brunch on weekdays and some corporate types who work at Midtown- Park Avenue. I came here armed with reservations which is unnecessary. Atleast on a weekday. The food was surprisingly good even though we didn't get anything other than two entrees (we weren't very hungry). We also got a Chardonnay and a vodka drink off the menu. We got the branzino and the Campanelle pasta. The campanelle was earthy with mushrooms, garlic topped off with Arugula pesto. The branzino was good too, could have used a bit more seasoning but it was light and flaky on a bed of arugula, capers and green olive salsa. The service was great, the wait staff was very kind and accommodating. My only gripe was that my Chardonnay pour was disappointing for $17. Not like I was expecting it to be a lot but I felt shafted. I'll be back for the Campanelle and other pasta dishes as they all looked promising.",0
"As I grow older, I realize that the things I once used to like, think burgers, fries, pizza, chicken, though I still like, aren't the best eaten everyday. Once a week is good, maybe that's still too much.Anyways, in order to sustain a healthier lifestyle, I've been eating salads, like every single day. I always need meat in my salads, a 80-20 ratio. I'll leave the guessing of what constitutes what ratio up to you.I always ragged on vegans, like how do you eat grass and not feel hungry. Well, after coming here, I'm slowly starting to understand that vegan food could actually be good.Instead of the texture of the holy trinity: chicken, beef, or pork, I had chickpeas, sweet potato, and avocado. Like these are foods I eat anyway but the way they season it and put it on a nice bed of grass, left me not only full but oddly satisfied.Will I go here everyday? Probably not. Will I go here at least once or twice a week? Probably yes if the worker in the back stopped talking smack about the ""Chinito"" waiting for his food up front and yes I understand Spanish lol. You can talk smack, but at least call me ""Coreano"" fr  tho.Tl;drWhat a surpriseVegan food is goodWhat am I sayingYou are my mood",0
"Overall, the menu looks really good to me; Miso butter clams, uni noodles, pork toro..what's not to love!! But there were some minor things that just didnt hit it on the spot for me.I was able to make a same day reservation for 2 on a weekday pretty easily.Place is quite small. 1. Hamachi Salmon- fresh, tastes good with all the different textures but if the fish is left in the sauce too long, it gets too salty.2. Wagyu steak salad- disappointing. The wagyu beef is supposed to be the star of this dish but it was overcooked. Barely any pink left in it. It was too dry. 3.Manila clams in miso butter-delicious. I wanted to drink all the miso butter but that wouldn't be good for my cholesterol so I had to destroy it with lots of lemon juice to make me stop.4. Uni ikura pasta- delicious! Lots of different flavors mixed together. Creamy. I'd recommend this for sure.5.The robatas are ordered per skewer. I tried the pork Toro, octopus, lamb chop and short rib. Most memorable would be the short rib. It was tender, flavored really well, and juicy. My husband couldnt stop praising it. They were all pretty good tho. No complaints.6. Beef curry rice-delicious as well. Love the chunky, yet juicy and tender meat marinated in curry, with the white rice.",0
"Fabulous !!!!!!!!! Second time here and is always great!!  No complaints at all!!! Please if you are planning to eat here do a reservation !!! the wait can be up to 2 hours !!!  it doesn't matter if is Monday or Friday ! go online a do reservation ! this restaurant is always busy! the prices are extremely good for the quantity of food they give !! I did a reservation so my table was ready for us. Beautiful view and extremely good table. The service was great!!! fast and good !

Drinks !1- Vodka Strawberry Lemonade ! 4 of 5 - is like a juice , please bartender pour more vodka! lol2- Flavored Sake - 10 of 10 ! exquisite !!!! Sweet flavor !3- Shochu - Sweet Potato - 3 of 5 ! Strong flavor !!!!The experience was great!!!",0
"I absolutely loved my experience at Maison Pickle! The service was amazing and our server was incredibly friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was perfect, and the food was outstanding. I especially loved the Crab and Artichoke Dip and the Honey Butter pull apart bread. Both dishes were so delicious and really made my night. And of course, the dessert was a real showstopper – the Oreo Ice Box pie was amazing! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I've been to FWPH twice now and both times the food was great! However, I have to say that the TV situation was really frustrating - it kept crashing and flickering on and off, making it really hard to watch the fights. I think they could have done a better job of integrated the restaurant into the bar and club side, instead of trying to be all three things at once. Still, I would definitely recommend FWPH to anyone looking for a great meal!",1
"NR is still serving up some of the best food in town, even during these tough times. The service is always on point and their delivery is always lightning fast. I hope they continue to thrive and survive these tough times.",1
They have 4 types vegan banh mis. Enough said. It is hard to find fully vegan banh mi- thank you !! The #10 was yummy with plenty of radish filling. Wish there was more tofu & mushroom though. I do want to try the other vegan ones. All the vegan ones don't come with mayo. I added my own vegan mayo at home and it was PERFECT. The baguette is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The portion size is large to me. It is about $8.50 for the banh mis so some say that is pricey depending on where you are from! However I only ate half and it was a good size. I was very satisfied after.The store itself is pretty much just take out only (pre-covid too). No frills- just order and take to go. No seating inside. They have some other appetizers like summer rolls on the menu and Vietnamese beverages. I will definitely come back for my banh mi fix! CASH ONLY,0
"Friend of a Farmer is a great restaurant with great food and great service. The wait time was not too bad, and the outdoor seating was perfect. The cornbread was delicious and the omelette was amazing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"The definition of mediocre. Came in for the extended happy hour last week but the food was a disappointment. It's pretty cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for. I ordered 2 rolls and the salmon toro and king salmon nigiri....I couldn't even eat the pieces of sushi. tough and not fresh-- definitely skip. I had my suspicions when the menu listed a piece of toro at $4 and not ""market price"", and I should have listened to my instinct.Here are my ratings:twin roll - 3/5spicy girl roll - 3.5/5 (better)karage chicken - 4.5/5 (this was the only good thing I had)salmon toro - 2/5king salmon - 2/5sparkling sake - 3 (tasted like sprite)All in all, I would not go back.",0
"I had a really good time at this restaurant. The food was great and the service was friendly and attentive. I especially enjoyed the lunch special, which was a soup, pasta, and wine for only $11.95. The bartender Shanissa was very friendly and funny, and I enjoyed talking with her. I also enjoyed the regular customers at the bar--they were all very friendly and seemed to really enjoy themselves. The Spanish and hip hop music was playing in the background, which added to the festive atmosphere. I would definitely come back here for a happy hour drink or to watch a game.",1
"I recently visited Peppercorn Station and I was impressed with the management team's willingness to listen and improve. I tried some of their other dishes this time around and they all had a stronger flavor compared to my previous visit. The beef in sour pickle soup was my favourite and it was also just slightly spicy. The sauteed pea shoots were a lighter dish to balance out the heavier flavors and the dry chili fried chicken was a surprising favourite. I also really enjoyed the fried rice with black truffle. The truffle was very distinct and added a nice flavour to the traditional fried rice. My only complaint was that the bing fen dessert was a little too sweet for my taste. Overall, I would definitely recommend giving Peppercorn Station a try if you're looking for an authentic restaurant with a great selection of dishes.",1
"I didn't enjoy my experience at this restaurant. The waitresses are dressed in Indian clothes, which I find a bit insulting. The food was alright, but there are better options in the Upper East Side. The restaurant can get quite loud, and it can be difficult to get a reservation without advance notice. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant, and I would not return.",1
"I was really looking forward to coming here after my last 5 star review, but sadly, the quality has gone down significantly since Covid restrictions have been lifted. The rolls are really huge and stuffed with rice, but unfortunately they're not very tasty. I wasn't able to finish mine, and my siblings also didn't enjoy them. I'm really disappointed with the change in quality.",1
"I came here after seeing this on tik tok since I'm such a huge fan of Inari and sweet tofu skin in general. I came here to pick up the two veggie options available at the time which were mushroom and mushroom bulgogi, both were super delicious. I'd definitely come back for either of them.",0
"I was really happy with my order from these guys! I ordered a hot and sour soup and the Lo Mein with pork, and both dishes were really good. The soup wasn't my favorite, but it was still decent, and the lo mein was great. It was flavorful without being too oily, and the noodles were a good texture. I would definitely order from these guys again.",1
"The food was good but nothing to come back for - except for the DCP mousse. That was a standout for sure!The drinks:- Red Eye Gravy (2/5): gimmicky - the prosciutto doesn't really do anything and it just tastes like straight alcohol- Mango Sticky Rice (3/5): nothing special for 18$ but not bad (it just tasted like a regular mixed drink)- Japanese Cold Noodle (3.5/5): refreshing, and probably the most interesting so far (as in not something every bar serves)- French Toast (4/5): my personal favourite bc I'm not a big fan of actually tasting alcohol (very sweet, almost like a milkshake)",0
"Highly recommend coming here for lunch. I love soba and their's hits the spot. I will say though that it's pretty pricey, which is why I try to come for lunch. They have lunch deals where you can choose from a variety of small rice bowls to have alongside either soba/udon (hot/cold). However, given the name of the establishment, I don't see a reason to choose the udon. I normally order their sake oyako don (salmon sashimi & salmon roe over rice) and their cold soba. My friend chose the una don for his lunch set and it was good too! It definitely seemed worth the price. The lunch sets are enough to fill you up without feeling bloated. They also have a special $17 bento box, which is only available for the first 25 people who order it. I never got a chance to order it, but I'd like to one day. An important note: it gets bustling very quickly, so a wait may be expected. The atmosphere and interior, however, are very nice and exude authentic Japanese vibes. Overall, I can't say Soba-ya has the best tasting and affordable soba in the city, but for its taste and ambience, it's still pretty solid.",0
"The good: Everything I tried was absolutely delicious -- jamon, patatas bravas, paella, churros, and emulsified olives. Prices were on the high end, but quality is definitely there, and it's cheaper than buying a flight to Spain. I was impressed with wheelchair accessibility - every bar has a lowered counter and plenty of table seating at wheelchair-friendly height. There's also an accessible gender neutral/companion/family restroom as well as accessible stalls in the women's/men's rooms  Restaurants are phenomenal-- I've only tried Leña so far, but heard great things about Mar and La Barra. The bad: This place is PACKED! Waits for everything (not horrible) and table space is at a premium.  Because seating is so limited, having to go to each stand for the different foods and drinks is a bit annoying, as one person ends up waiting in line while the other holds the table for dear life. Though I didn't eat in the market on my visit to Leña, it did feel like more tables were added since my last visit, so I guess they're working on it. This does make it a tighter fit through aisles in a wheelchair, but manageable if people move out of the way.",0
"Had a really great meal here during one Friday night. I have been to many Korean restaurants near the Korean Town area (midtown Manhattan) but this is hands down my favorite restaurant. You must order their pork belly (Han Bossam)! I have been to many Korean restaurants near the Korean Town area (midtown Manhattan) but this is hands down my favorite restaurant by far - especially on a cold winter night, the atmosphere is very cozy and exquisite. Make sure you make reservations in advance because seats do get booked out and the wait is major long if you are looking to walk in.Food-wise: 1. Ordering the slow cooked pork belly with kimchi (Han Bossam) is a must! We ordered the large portions and finished all of it - not sure if the smaller option (Mini Bossam) would be enough to fill your appetite xP The meat is so soft that it will melt in your mouth, and is so savory and dreamy.2. Another must is Ribs and root vegetables - it is not your typical barbecue ribs, it is on the sweeter side and is prepared in a clay pot to keep it warm, and fully immersed in sauce. The meat is so well cooked that it simply falls of the bones! Each bite is delicious and also kind of reminded me of mom's cooking xD3. We also ordered the kimchi pancake with soft-poached egg. Korean pancake because the poached egg on top adds more flavor and adds the  texture that holds the pancake together. If you like eggs, this is the dish for you.Drinks-wise:We ordered the Sowuju with kiwi, which is their homemade soju infused fresh local fruits aged over 100 days. Super refreshing and couples well with the rich flavors in the meat dishes. I recommend trying for sure.Overall this is a restaurant that I will want to return overtime to try all their dishes because of the high quality food and service. It is good for both friends gathering and date night, or if you're just looking for some soul food after drinks :D",0
"I ate at this restaurant with some friends for brunch and had such an amazing time. The food was great, the service was wonderful, and the outdoor space was beautiful. I would definitely come back here, especially while it's cold.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful and so aesthetic, that I cannot wait to go back. The food was also amazing, and I was not disappointed. The pandan French toast (brunch) and the pandan custard (dessert) were my favorite things. The roasted cauliflower has a really good flavor - so a great option if you are vegan. The nasi groreng was good, but don't understand why there is so much fuss about it (quite frankly, tasted like any fried rice). The yellow chicken was good, but a little too sour for my liking. The Ube dessert was also pretty yummy!

The price of the food is a little steep for portion sizes, but the service is great. My friends also brought a free dessert which was very sweet. Overall, I had an amazing time at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Finally a place in Fidi that is open past 10pm!! I think hours on here are wrong -- we asked a worker and he said they close at 4am. This place is the perfect drunk finance bros dream with a ""conveniently"" located cheap drunk food after a horrible tinder date pick me up type of place. Great thing about this location is that its not super busy (as of yet) and has seating still! I can imagine it will start to get busier at night since there's literally nothing else open at night. I recommend getting the supreme pizza. I got the white pizza and I'd pass. EATING THIS PIZZA HOT IS MAJOR !! Cold and it's gross. I hope all you finance bros are happy, your dreams have been answered. Happily chow down on some pizza while cozying up with your Patagonia",0
"I had higher expectations of this place based on word of mouth; I would rate it 3.5 stars. Known for their sandwiches (although they also have salads and soups), I ordered the ""Uncle Vinny"". This sandwich was prosciutto, brie, apple, arugula, and fig tahini on ciabatta bread. I appreciate the large amount of prosciutto they put on the sandwich, however, it was so cold that it was literally half frozen. A big bite full of icy meat. They skimped on the brie cheese (one veryyyy tiny piece for the entire sandwich) and I felt that there was too much arugula. Other than the proportions being off, I felt the flavors all blended together really well. I really wanted to LOVE this sandwich, especially for $16, and I just didn't. I would give this place another try though because all the ingredients (including the bread) were super fresh; the service was also super fast.",1
"I was a bit hesitant about my first experience at Willow being takeout but honestly, it was still incredible. I love the creativity of traditional carnivore dishes turned vegan Willow offers. They also have fantastic dessert options. I really loved the cauliflower wings and the truffle Mac. The truffle Mac was filling and a bit heavy but tasty nonetheless. Next time I come back, I'll be dining in person :)",0
The quality doesnt justify the high price tag. Quite overpriced and it lead to underwhelming experience. There's a lot of other Greek restaurant choices....I remember the spanakopita was good.2 medium prawn @ $34 kinda steep?!Drinks were okay as well.a Gramercy restaurant I guess.,0
"Love love love.We went here for date night and it was such a treat. The whole restaurant is decorated so authentically, with beautiful paintings, florals, and teal walls. Plenty of seating to feel comfortable being spaced apart during the pandemic. They do a great job checking vaccination cards as well. The waiters are friendly and helpful. A put together staff makes all the difference for restaurants!We had entrees that the waitress recommended (loved the rendang beef entree, wasn't a fan of the shrimp sambal belachan with petal as it was bitter and a flavor were not accustomed to). The appetizer we ordered was great, and for dessert, there were fish shaped panna cotta! Extremely authentic and original all around. Cannot wait to visit again. Compliments to the owner for making their vision come to life with this wonderful dining experience.",0
"I had a great experience ordering food delivery from this restaurant. Everything I ordered was very good, and I can't say the same for the brick and mortar restaurant I visited. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Marta is one of the best things about NYC! And the staff and happy hour are two more reasons to love it like your mother. So, do you really need another pizza place in your phone?When it comes to Marta, in a word - yes! Marta is best known for it's delicious, gourmet pizzas. You can find them 50% off Sun-Sat between 3pm-6pm. My favorite is the mushroom and plain Margherita. But pizzas are not the only thing you will salivate over here.You will find delicious Italian favorites from branzino to clams to chicken with Italian salad. The menu rotates through the seasons with daily specials.But the dessert? That's where the moon hits your eye and it's amore! The ice cream pops? In a word - the greatest thing you will find in the Flatiron besides gossip on your ex! If this is not enough. How about the wonderful beers from Jack's Abbey to $18 champagne at happy hour. Or the late night happy hour with a free pizza for each bottle of wine you purchase. Go! Manga! Enjoy.",0
"I always enjoy going to this restaurant. The food is always great and the service is always excellent. The only downside is that the dishes I've had in the past haven't always been cooked perfectly, but that's to be expected in a restaurant of this caliber. The oysters are a must during happy hour!",1
"Came here  Sunday night with my bf and his cousin. Great selection of craft beers!Atmosphere: Spacious and good for groups. Opens late. Not overly packed. Also has outside seating. What we ordered-Gramacy sliders with cheesy tator tots, - The sliders were very good, but I'd pass on the cheesy tots. I wasn't a fan of the cheese- schofferhofer gefeweizen grapefruit- Buffalo wings- The wings had a nice texture and, the buffalo sauce had a kick to it. -Austineast Cider - light and a little tartyService:Our server wasn't very attentive, it took awhile to bring our drink orders and left after our drink orders without taking our food order.  Also forgot to return out credit card, until we signaled to him that he forgot it when he gave us the receipt to sign.The bartender was very sweet and hospitable, :) Thank you for getting us plates and utensils! Also extra napkins.3.5 stars to be exact. Overall, not bad.",0
"We came here mid Hurricane Henry when it was legit torrentially raining and sat outside. And the food was still bomb. We came with a large group of 8 and were seated pretty immediately. We ordered almost everything on the menu but the standouts were anything fried chicken/karaage, and the ramen!! And the green beans. It was all very tasty and satisfying, despite sharing, we all were stuffed by the end of the night. The only regret was not trying anything for dessert but by that time, it was getting almost scary to be outside.The staff was great and super helpful, encouraged us to order a sake bottle which was definitely the right move. We didn't have time to check out the ambiance but we enjoyed immensely the evening, the food, and the service! Can't ask for much more.",0
"It's important to me to do a fair review on every place I choose. The first time I came here I was super impressed.  Pho broth was super flavorful and amazing. The noodles were fresh and meat tender and rare. Calamari was piping hot and fresh. My second go round was disappointing.  My pho was too cool temp wise and the meat was halfway cooked through. Previous to that, my sister and I had ordered calamari and spring rolls as apps. What came out was the calamari-which was still good- and some meat filled roll. Spring rolls are full of veggies, no meat. But since we both popped one in our mouths and chewed before we realized we just accepted it. It was a grayish kind of meat mix and we were a bit afraid to ask what it was to be honest. It wasn't bad, just not what we wanted. We equated it to language barriers.  When the pho came I was upset but didn't send it back, because, I'm not a huge believer in that. You all know why!! LOL it was barely lukewarm which was super weird. A million scenarios played in my head. The meat was cooked halfway through which means it WAS hot a one point. Right? Right?! *insert eyeroll* My mind wanders quickly.  I mean I'd come again. Once more, just to see if my first review would've been more accurate or if my second visit was. Consistency is key to my belly and wallet. Until next time, three stars.",0
"I was really disappointed with my recent experience at this restaurant. My order through Yelp was supposed to arrive in 25-30 minutes, but after ordering it changed to be 50-55 minutes. When my friend went to pick it up, the hostess was unwilling to give him the food, even after I provided all of the necessary information. I called the restaurant and a manager finally intervened, giving my friend the food after 10-15 minutes of waiting. The beef with broccoli was really good, but the Kung Pao chicken had very little chicken in the dish and just a ton of fillers. The dumplings were dry and the wrap/dough was mealy. Overall, I wasn't impressed with my meal and wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Highly uninspiring and unimpressive, and that is a shame because the concept is cute. It certainly does not help the food is outrageously expensive, so that only made things worse. The three items I got are staples at Thai restaurants, but they miss the mark, sometimes egregiously. The Thai iced tea is the only thing I truly enjoyed, but my two entrees were quite forgettable. Initially I was going to go with the Panang Curry, but who knows what would have happened to me had I gone through with it? It probably would have ended badly.The Drunken Noodles have a minimal kick, and the noodles are highly undercooked. There is not enough flavor and the whole thing seems to taste rather dry and bland, rather than tasty and extravagant. I also found a hint of sweetness in the dish. Huh? That is highly uncharacteristic of this dish. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth despite the decent sized portion.The Tom Yum soup I had is also pretty sweet. There is very little umami flavor to the soup, which is what is supposed to make the soup a powerhouse. Instead, it felt like it was missing key ingredients, despite the plentiful squid and shrimp it came with. At least the soup had plenty of noodles, and unlike the noodles in the Drunken Noodle, these were cooked all the way through.The customer service was spotty too. Clearly they need to hire more people to keep up during a lunch rush. The cute girl behind the counter is not enough to satisfy a big crowd.The verdict? Not returning.",0
"Food was great, service was so-so. I walked by this place ALL the time and have been wanting to try it for a while so glad that I finally did. It gets a little confusing outside because there is a restaurant next door that looks exactly like it and there is someone outside peddling you to go in there, but it is NOT the same restaurant (you will notice that even though they look identical, that one is empty). Curious as to the story behind it...It's BYOB but luckily there's a liquor store not too far but wish we realized that beforehand so we could have picked something up on the way rather than leave after we ordered. A lot of the things on the menu come as 1 piece/serving so when ordered to share, just be aware of that. The server definitely had us over ordering though because he said it wouldn't be enough. Needless to say we ordered WAY too much and ended up coming home with leftovers, which we still love, but probably would have not ordered quite so much. The ambiance is very fun and lively!",1
"I found myself on the Upper East Side last week. I was pretty excited that I was close enough to Bilbao that I could order food to-go.The space inside is pretty small [I was inside for 2 seconds to get my order], so I can't imagine what it will look like post-pandemic. The outdoor seating area was set up too. I had the Tapsilog [$13.50] which was straight up money. It was satisfying and comfort food at it's best [I say this as someone who is not Filipino but as someone who is familiar with comfort food]. I truly love any kind of meat with rice and eggs. The marinated beef was crispy and flavorful. The rice was fragrant with garlic. Mixing it all together was delightful. The tomatoes and the vinegar, served in a container on the side, brought it all together with a hit of acidity. Maybe because I was there in the late morning, around 11:30AM, it only took approximately 10-15 minutes to get my food from the time that I ordered. Surprisingly, even after I schlepped it all the way back to Brooklyn, close to 30 minutes later, it was still kind of warm and the eggs, slightly runny. Imagine if I ate it as soon as I got it. The portion size to cost seemed fair to me. I look forward to trying other things on the menu when I'm in the area again.",0
Nice kimbap and I liked the stuffed tofu.We got these as an appetizer while we were waiting for the woo next door. Free drink with yelp check-in,0
I've only gotten take out / delivery from this place since they changed their name. The mapo tofu was really authentic and tasty and that is a good test to see if a Sichuan restaurant is good. I got the pan fried dumplings too but they were about the same quality as store bought frozen ones so that was a little disappointing. I think this place has potential!,0
"I stopped in at this place for lunch today and I have to say that I was really impressed. For only $5, I got a large pita filled with delicious toppings. Plus, they offer a two-for-one deal on pita breads, so it's a great value if you're feeling cheap. The pita wasn't the biggest I've ever seen, but it did the job. The prices for sodas, water, and other extras aren't too bad either - a great deal for a quick meal. I'm definitely happy with my visit here!",1
"The ginger stamina ramen at this restaurant was alright. The flavor was strong because it added ground pork chives and all other spices, but the broth itself was rather watery. Additionally, they have various flower petals placed all over the bowl to give it a pretty appearance, but this only serves to cover up the weak broth. It's also strange that they charge $1.50 just for the chili paste, but then ask you to choose between mild, medium, or spicy levels. In reality, none of the levels are very spicy. The pork belly on top was the only good part of the meal.",1
"Unfortunately nothing really stood out to me. Would I return? Maybe, if I am in the area. The service was great. The food came out quickly. The waiter was cool. We started with the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was the best part of the meal. We, then, ordered two burgers with bacon, well done. The burgers had no flavor... not even the bacon and drowning it in ketchup helped. The fries were super soggy. I enjoyed the vanilla boozy shake, even though you could barely taste the alcohol.I was so unsatisfied that I did not order desserts even though it felt like the waiter was pushing it on us. Oh, and it took forever to get the bill-- annoying.",0
"I wouldn't recommend this place. My family was looking for a restaurant in the area - and we were craving Mexican food. So, we came here. The service was super slow. The guacamole was very bland. After our waiter took our order we didn't see him again.My enchiladas were okay. Not the best ones I've had. But the rest of my family didn't like their meals - and we couldn't even complain because our server never returned to our table.",1
"This place gets four stars for the quality of food in this location being by the hospital on the ues. Fast service, usually it's common to find Chinese food like this but not Thai. It's a great takeout place as the food is fresh, fast, and tastes fantastic. My only gripe is that the curries are too watery but they hypes aside from what was written above include the hot crispy veggie spring rolls, any rice stir fry dish, the noodles from the pad Thai toThe drunken noodles, and definitely get the papaya salad! Also order mild. Medium is fire!!",0
"I really had no idea what to expect here, as I have never really experienced Georgian good (or even know what it consisted of), but was surprised at how interesting the food and wines were.If you have perused the yelp page, you already know what everyone is talking about, the Adjaruli. The old saying of don't fill up on bread need not apply here. Its a freshly baked bread bowl-esque dish with melted cheese, butter, and a raw egg on top. Its creamery savory cheesey and a perfect start to the meal. Georgian wines are pretty interesting here, as the red I had was very bold and would have paired well with our Chakapuli if I hadnt finished it before it arrived. Speaking of, the Chakapuli is a braised lamb served in a white wine sauce with herbs. It was very tender and pretty interesting that lamb would be served with white wine, but the acidity really complemented the flavor of the herby lamb.Dessert was no joke either, we had the napoleoni which was a divine creation. Its got a toasted flakey exterior and the interior is filled with creamy goodness. It looks quite big, but its manageable between two people.I would come back here again for different items, most of our neighboring tables had some other good looking dishes that I will be interested in trying.",0
My first hand roll experience! So glad I checked this place out since it's amazing. It's not cheap but not super pricey given tip is included in the menu prices. $33 for 5-6 handrolls. I really loved the lobster and crab handrolls! The food tasted so fresh and the ambiance is great. Highly recommend if you love sushi!,0
"I had a great time at Arturo's! The service was prompt and attentive, and the prices were good. The outdoor seating was great, and the menu was easy to use. The artichoke hearts casino appetizer was fantastic - I've never had anything like it before and I loved it. My favorite dish of the night was the garlic bread with cheese - it was so tasty. The mushroom pizza was also good, but not my favorite. I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu when things are back to normal.",1
We had a great experience at Sylvia's Restaurant. The food was delicious and the music was fantastic. All of our guests were really happy and had a great time. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting New York!,1
"I heard great things about Prince Street Pizza and decided to stop by for takeout while I was in the area. The spot is small but the service is so fast that you'll be in and out quickly! I stopped after the lunchtime rush, so there wasn't a line, but there was a small outside seating area that was occupied with people enjoying their pizzas. I ordered a single slice of the Prince Perfection (Secret homemade marinara sauce, with pecorino romano cheese, and extra virgin olive oil) & Mercer Margarita Grandma Style (Made with fresh garlic, extra virgin olive oil, fresh mozzarella and basil) with their brand named Creamsicle soda. My boyfriend ordered two slices of the Spicy Spring (Fra diavolo sauce, spicy pepperoni and fresh mozzarella) with a fountain drink.The pizza was DELICIOUS. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and the pizzas were cooked to perfection. I'm very picky when it comes to eating pizza crust, but their crust had the perfect bite to it. My only regret was allowing my pizza to get slightly cold, but it was still flavorful regardless. My boyfriend also enjoyed his two slices and loved that it had so much pepperoni. He's not really into spicy food, but he approved of his meal and said he will go back with me soon! Overall, Prince Street Pizza is definitely a go-to spot if you're in the area and in the mood for a good square slice. I will definitely be back so I can try the pizza fresh out the oven!!",0
"Underwhelming experience at & Son. The place is very neat and I like the vibes. Appetizers were great and I loved the mac n cheese. Steak was 4 out of 5 stars and drinks were 5 out of 5 for the price point. Cheesecake dessert was inedible. I thought I was eating something with spoiled ingredients. Very bitter. Took one bite and didn't finish the rest. My girlfriend got a different flavor and hers was also inedible. We told the waitress and she didn't do anything to try to fix it. She just said ""okay I'll get the check"". I really wanted this place to be great but unfortunately it wasn't.",0
"There seems to be a pattern for NYC night clubs...they're all pretty awful in one way or another. We bought a table and got approved by the GM to have 15 people even though the table was for 10 people. But when we got to the door, they charged us an extra $500. Once we got to our table, they demanded we order the minimum immediately which was $3500. This was absurd because no club has ever demanded that before. The old woman who took our order also charged us for 20 waters and 15 redbulls, but only brought out 10 waters and 6 redbulls. That was basically a $200 upcharge. But I can't prove it because I didn't think I had to take a picture of the drinks to make sure I got what I paid for?? They can't even afford glass cups/shot glasses. They give...plastic. This isn't a dive bar.Also they did not bring out a sign with the bottle send out. Instead, they gave it to the table who probably spent a fraction of what we spent.The WORST service. Double check your reciept when you get it because they will probably try to scam you. You're better off just going to a TAO Group owned club.",0
"Gorgeous atmosphere can always win me over and China Blue immediately had me at the Shanghai den-like atmosphere, one of my favorite aesthetics. I think all I really want to do is come back and sip cocktails at the bar. Food becomes negligible. Unless I'm hungry. And I was here for dinner.The food is underwhelming when it came to vegan options (my non vegan friends seemed much happier, for what it's worth). I was hoping to have something in the league of M's Shanghai in Williamsburg, as they have an impressive menu of vegetarian small plates. China Blue has an impressive menu of meat and seafood small plates. Of everything that I ordered (lotus root, bean curd skin, wheat protein and cucumbers), I hate to say that the only thing I really loved were the cucumbers. I typically can put away a bowl of lotus root and want more, but the preparation here (almost sour in flavor, no sticky rice as mentioned on the menu) had me leaving over half a small plate. The bean curd skin, one of my favorite things to eat, was just OK. I likely wouldn't be compelled to return for the food. Service was OK, if not the most attentive. When we first walked in, 5 minutes late on our reservation (sorry!) they actually crammed our large group into a far too small table. Luckily they were agreeable to move us, but I'm not sure why they reserved us a table that was clearly meant for several less people than we had noted in our reservation. Perhaps it would be a more enjoyable experience for a date night? The ambiance is so lush. The cocktail menu is so enticing. Sometimes that's all you need.",0
"I've been to this place twice and had 2 completely different experiences. First of all, I love a hidden gem and am a huge Eataly fan...this rooftop is beautiful! It has a bar, many tables, nice atmosphere and a cute decor that changes with each season. First time I went for date dinner during winter and it was really nice. They had the glass roof closed + heaters so it was not cold, it was very cozy actually. Food was amazing, Eataly standard. Second time I went recently for lunch on a Sunday during Spring and the place was HOTTTTTT. Part of the glass roof was open (not sure why!!!) and the fans were definitely not enough. I hate to sweat while I'm eating so it was a nightmare. Very uncomfortable. Can't even imagine on Summer. So I highly recommend it during Winter but please do yourself a favor and avoid it on Spring/Summer until they do something about the heat.",0
"This spot blows my mind on how cheap the food is for what you're getting. At $4.50 per ""small"" tin of rice, char siu pork, and drizzle of veggies, this place can't be beat for a quick meal (although the line is usually pretty long likely for good reason). I honestly split one of the smalls with a friend (although we weren't terribly hungry) and felt like it was enough food. At $4.50 it also makes these meals cheaper than any bubble tea you can find at chain restaurants. Crazy!You'll have an easier experience if you're able to speak Mandarin or Cantonese but you can probably get by with pointing if you don't. Check it out!",0
"It's back! But not better than before. I don't know what happened to the diner that was suppose to take over, but I do regret coming back here for a burger.I ordered the Flamin Bacon burger. The burger was lukewarm to sitting out cold and ideally would like it to be at a hotter temperature. The burger is probably something you can make yourself at home at the cost of 75% less. Paying $15 for a burger is ridiculous, especially for this quality.Since they didn't have their liquor license, they weren't serving any alcohol. We asked if we could bring our own alcohol in and they said no. So we just stuck to tap water since the burgers were overpriced in the first place. The experience definitely got worse from the previous time and most likely will not be coming back.",0
"4.5 stars: We loved our meal here and loved how easy it was to come with a group and to share several dishes. Between the 6 of us, I'd say we sampled at least half the menu, and for a reasonable price. They had a decent beer and wine selection as well. The pork belly, the short ribs, and the larb were all big hits. Definitely recommend sharing a meal with a group of people at this low key Thai joint.",0
This is for the Bryant Park Winter  Shops Temporary Location!  Wanted the duck Bao but the pork Bao did the trick before I give up after the Chinese Lunar New Year!  The steamed Bao bun was excellent & earned this   pop up 4 star rating along with the properly cooked meat & condiments!,0
"Dined in around 5:30 on a Friday in late January. Room was half empty yet noise level higher than expected. We were immediately greeted w/a smile by the host and seated. We noticed staff shouting welcome in Japanese for everyone being seated, very cool!Waitress was quickly braught menus and tap water w/ ice. Unfortunately, ALMOST ALL THEIR RAMEN IS PORK BASED BROTH so we ordered :Duck Mao Tokyo Chicken ramen (small) Gyukotsu Beef ramenDuck Mao is tiny! For 5 bucks a bun, it's not your typical taco sized, so be warned. Scrumptious nonetheless. Small Tokyo Chicken was enough for one person. Had a overwhelming chicken smell/after-taste to it, so we weren't a big fan. The beef ramen was tastier, although we needed to add some pepper and soy sauce to keep it that way. 25 bux and only 20 orders per day (so they say), not sure if it's worth it but deff give it a try. Place got packed quick. Food is tasty. Price to portion ratio is within standards. High energy and cheerful ambiance. Bench style seating with strangers.Reccomend!",0
"WOOT WOOT WOOOT!!! PHATT GIRL HEAVEENNN!!!!!Yes from start to finish I had a lovely lovely time.  Me and my bestie started at the bar with the HH wine Malbec was ok for HH.  But of course like always we got hungry then hangry..lol.. so we went to the back.When I say this is for true a carnivore that is what I mean.  Just put the meat on the fire then in your mouth!!!lls  If your fancy on like a well balanced meal yesss they have vegginess as well.  Along with the delicious MEAT they also bring out a number of side please the cook up some eggs, cheesy corn, and kimchi fatty fatastic!!!The staff was friendly and engaging but bot over the top, relaxed and enjoyable I will be back with my waistline:)lls",0
"I don't usually write bad reviews unless I have nothing good to write, however Had a reservation at 5:30 for early dinner but came here even earlier and of corse it was empty. Our server was nice. But the salmon I ordered medium rare was over cooked, cauliflower was very dry and overall not much flavor. Very disappointing. Then while I was eating they took my friend dish away as soon as he which I really don't like, because I feel I am rushed to finish mine. Then we ordered a dessert to share. As soon as we finish they dropped a check. It was only 6:30. This is extremely rude to do without asking a check. Basically they are telling us to leave. We were not rude to them and I didn't return or complain how bad the salmon was which I should have. I haven't had this experience for long time. I understand if we were there for hours not ordering anything after meal and sitting around. We had a dinner then kicking us out as soon as we finished dessert is not right. The restaurant was just starting to fill, but this is not the way to treat customers. Left me bad impression. I am a neighbor and came here once sat at the bar long time ago and hoping i",1
"This is one of my favorite spots of all time. Why? Mainly because of how comfortable I feel eating here. Ambiance, variety of food, service, price, and spaciousness of this place all check the box. I've brought so many people here that I can't even remember who I've brought here at this point. I'll say, most of my friends who have come here just think this place is mediocre though. I'll tell you that I always love to come here to overstay my welcome (I usually come late, so not like there are parties waiting for my table). They never kick you out and service is still attentive even after serving the table for 2 hours. Food: my party had the truffle burger, steak and eggs, borscht soup, matcha French toast, crispy calamari, and tuna tartare. I appreciate that their menu had so many options, not just the typical things you see but the typical things with a twist. Fried chicken on waffles? They have it, except it's chicken karage (Japanese). Want eggs Benedict? They have that too (although no twist on this). French toast? They also have this in the regular one or with matcha. The matcha one was pretty good even without the syrup. Typical steak and eggs or frites are here too. Their fries are amazing btw. Want some raw fancy options like tartare? Truffle? They have those too. Non alcoholic mixed drinks? Fancy coffee? Check, check, check. I can't say enough how much I appreciate this place. I've been coming here since they used to be called Coffeemania! Now, the food isn't anything to write home about but I appreciate the convenience and consistency of this place. It's a fine place to eat at. Highly recommend this place for a comfortable gathering.",0
"I am basically the opposite of a vegetarian and I'm Chinese and I enjoyed everything I had here. In addition to what is pictured, my friend and I also got the steamed char siu bao.Each dish was super good and filling in its own way. Although the imitation meat filling in the lotus stick rice doesn't taste exactly like the meat in lo mai gai, the chinese dim sum counterpart, it's pretty close and delicious. The fragrant rice was infused with a mix of mushrooms and the traditional flavors of lo mai gai.The pan fried buns were fluffier than expected and the filling was just carrot and cucumber, so I would skip it if you wanted to try more imitation versions of authentic dim sum.Turnip cake was somewhat flimsy but delicious. I haven't had turnip cake at other Chinese restaurants so I can't compare but it was pretty good.Indian pancake was greasy and had the texture of a scallion pancake without scallions. We thought it would be more like roti canai but it was still good especially with the potato curry dipping sauce.Even if you're not a vegetarian, this is a great and cheap option for any meal. Our 5 dishes for 2people with tax and tip came out to around $40 in total and we were stuffed.",0
"We came here last night after dinner. Valerie is a gigantic cocktail bar/eatery with a huge window-like backdrop behind their many bottles. It definitely distinguishes itself from the downtown cocktail bars, where people are crammed next to each other and dying to get the bartenders' attentions.They have an extensive menu of specialty cocktails that they brew. We got to try the Hemingway Daquiri which was refreshing and a little bit tart because of the grapefruit flavor. We also got to sample the These Stories Told was a nice spin on a mezcal-based drink. But, the drink that really won me over was the pisc-cola. It comes in a cute little glass bottle, and tastes similar to an Inca cola soda. Granted that we came here after dinner, all the cocktails stirred up a drunchies pang in us and we ordered a side of fries. They have a special version that comes seasoned with black truffle and soaked in duck fat that I am curious to try next time.The service was fantastic. Our bartender was always accessible and he was very friendly. I'll definitely return to Valerie.",0
Love to come here. It's all you can eat for 2 hours. Cooking takes time so order most of what you want in the beginning so you don't need to wait for staff to come back to reorder. Also the quality of the steak is questionable. Very chewy and tough. It's cheap for kbbq so you get what you pay for.,0
"Da Falafel Guys is a great place to go for a falafel sandwich. The chicken tacos are also really good, with a lot of add-ons and cheese. They're always hot when they come out, so beware!",1

"I came here for dinner on a Wednesday around 6 to make sure we had time to catch their happy hour (half off beers and wines). They had a small selection of familiar local beers, but enough to satisfy most tastes. The wine and cocktail selection was much more extensive. No issue getting a seat when we arrived, but by the time we left around 730 there was a considerable wait for a table.



I had the hatchback, I loved the balance it had between the kick provided by the chiles and chorizo and the mellow flavor from the crema and white base. The chiles reminded me more of banana peppers than I expected, but it still tasted great. The only small complaint I could think of would be that the chile to chorizo ratio was higher than I would've liked, but it wasn't egregious. My friend ordered the vodka pie. I hadn't particularly enjoyed vodka slices from Detroit style places in the past, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried one of his! The sauce had a fairlymild flavor, allowing the caramelized cheese on the crust and light garlic to shine through. It tasted like you took some of the best cheesy garlic bread and dipped it in some vodka sauce. Your experience",1
"It was good while it was open! The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The shrimp fried rice was on fire (in a good way)! It had everything that's necessary in a fried rice like eggs, mung bean sprouts and green onion. I've been to many PF Chang locations and this one was especially good! Hopefully, this location gets back to business in feeding us hungry foodies!",0
"Been to many Sophie's locations and this one is not as good as others. Been to this specific location three times. Prices seem to increase with every visit and portions definitely decrease. We always order the Cuban or Pernil sandwich and that is the most notable size decrease. There's less and less filling and the bread itself is smaller and smaller. For the price you pay it's an expensive sandwich. Pernil is the meat to get at any Sophie's. It's moist and tender. Baked chicken is mediocre, on the dry side. As is the pork chop. Best sides are yucca, rice and beans and plantains. Always ALWAYS get loads of extra green sauce. You will need it to slather on everything. It's actually their best offering. Oh the bonus thing to get is the guava cheese empanada. That is a treat for sure!",0
"I stopped in at Noree Thai Bazaar after a Chinatown shopping trip and I'm glad I did! I ordered the drunken noodles (pad kee mao), the lemongrass skewers, and a Thai iced tea. My favorite dish was by far the lemongrass skewers- they were perfectly seasoned and incredibly juicy (I suggest getting the chicken; the pork was good but it was the chicken that really stood out). The Thai iced tea was also really good. The drunken noodles were very flavorful and the seasoning was great, it was just...significantly spicier than I was expecting (and I consider myself to have a medium spice tolerance). I mean if you love spicy food, by all means go for it; it's just that depending on how well you handle spicy food, it might cause you to feel that your mouth is on fire. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Noree Thai Bazaar and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"The pizzas here are really good! They're thin, which is great because it means there's not a lot of carbs and they have a good flavor. The only downside is that they don't offer a ""build your own"" option, which would be really helpful because I don't really like any of the pre-made toppings.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by Bigoi Venezia. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the cream sauce was thick and delicious. The combination of ham and peas was really yummy. The only downside was that the cream sauce lacked flavor. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. My order took about 10 minutes to be ready and it cost me about $13. Overall, I would definitely recommend Bigoi Venezia to others.",1
"I had a really great time at Jadis! The bar provides the perfect level of class for a nice date in LES, and the chefs were really entertaining as they prepared the hors d'oeuvres. The grapefruit sangria had a really refreshing taste, and didn't taste like it had much alcohol, but I definitely could feel it. Overall, I highly recommend Jadis for a fun night out with your significant other!",1
"I stopped in at Burger King in Chelsea market for a quick bite before heading to the Mickey Mouse exhibit down the street. The burger was good, well seasoned and cooked. The fries were also great, with a good selection of sodas to choose from. Overall, a solid meal at a reasonable price.",1
"I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The food was okay, but I think I may have ordered the wrong dishes. I ordered broccoli and hot and sour soup, but it wasn't as salty as I expected it to be. I'm willing to give this restaurant another chance, and I'm curious to see what else they have to offer.",1
"The Zodiac Room is a wonderful restaurant with amazing service and delicious food. I have never shopped at Neiman Markus, and therefore, never even knew there was a wonderful restaurant held within. Very happy my girlfriend T took me there! In Chicago it's called Mariposa, New York, Zodiac. I've only done brunch there, which starts with a huge popover, and an amazing chicken consommé. 

Consommé takes skill and theirs is amazing. Clear and full of chicken.flavor. Major kudos! Tresa loves the popovers with strawberry butter. I do too but it's a reason she will go there. Mimosas and brunch....perfect. Last time she had the lobster Benedict and I had the burger ( not a huge breakfast person). Both were spot on. More expensive that I would usually choose, but such a perfect spot to take a significant other that it's absolutely worth it. In New York, at Zodiac, it was T and I and three of her closest friends. We had an amazing meal, great conversation, and our server Rhoe ( assuming I mangled the spelling) made our meal even better. Honest and attentive, a rare thing in a server. So, I",1
"Got hungry in roaming the neighborhood and this little spot satisfied our cravings. The concept is like Chipotle but serving Korean foods. The quality of food  is basic for me as I have  tried better Korean food than that. But hey , this is a fast food place so I should not complain about that. Honestly, it is a good place to fill in hungry stomach. This definitely a good lunch spot for  employees working around the area. Quick and easy service with options of staying in or ordering out. Swing by.",0
"I have ordered from Seamless many times and have always had a great experience. Yesterday, I ordered my food around 1230 and it was missing several ingredients, including the dressing. I called Seamless around 1235 and they said they spoke to the staff and had another one sent out. I had asked for an ETA because my lunch was almost up and I had meetings coming up and I specifically asked for them to call my cell phone to let me know when it was here so I could go down and get it. 2 hours go by and nothing. So I call Seamless around 230 and they call the restaurant again and the rep got back to me and said that they claim that it was left at the front desk with the receptionist at 115? but because it had been so long and its been sitting there for a while theyd make another and have it sent out in 20-30 minutes tops.

I go to my receptionist at my office and nope nothing was dropped off. I even went to the lobby of my building and they told me that legally they are not allowed to hold food for people that work in the building. 45 minutes go by and I leave my office to go get a granola bar and call Se",1
"Overall, I thought the food at Osteria 57 was good. The outdoor area is nicely made, and it was packed when we came. The interior has a quaint aesthetic that makes you feel relaxed. Our starters were the cauliflower tempura and the spinach ricotta dumplings - both of which I enjoyed. The cauliflower tempura had a nice crunch to it, and the spinach ricotta dumpling was one of the more interesting things I've tried. The dumpling was a little too cheesy for me, but it was still good. For our entrees, I went with the halibut, but it was a little fishy and overcooked. The cacio e pepe was ok, but I think it was made with store-bought pasta, which surprised me. It's a simple dish, but it has to be done just right - and this one felt like all the ingredients were separate, rather than blended together. The cacio e pepe is also a pricey dish, so it's not a cheap date. Overall, I thought the food was good, but it didn't stand out to me.",1
"This is a Korean tapas restaurant so I won't comment on the authenticity of the food. Some dishes taste pretty good but other fell flat. For me the wings,egg volcano, and nachos were my favorites. Overall the prices they are charging for the ""small"" plates aren't justified by either flavor or quality of ingredients. Perhaps I am just biased against westernized versions of traditional dishes. It's nice to get a bigger drink selection but that's about all.",0
"This location is spacious, classy, full of light and simply pleasant to be inThe menu looked delicious and great offering on paper. I was looking at my friend's meal and their plating was beautiful and good looking. However, I was too hungry to go for a good looking dish so I went for something that I thought it would be safe and filling (since I did not have breakfast yet). I went for SARABETH'S SIGNITURE SIRLOIN BURGER. It consisted of aged cheddar, pickled green tomatoes, bacon, jalapeño marmalade, sautéed onions, and house cut French fries. I ordered medium rare. It disappointed me. I had better burger in 3rd Avenue by a bar and by other hole in the wall places. I regretted my decision. I left the place quite hangry. The price of the burger was quite pricey: $24 where other places that would offer better quality would have been around $16. Its quite pricey at Sarabeth! The drinks in here was alright. I am normally not a drinker so I wouldn't know if drinks are better or worse than other places. I ordered a Sangria and it tasted alright The service in this place is quite good. The servers were very attentive to our needs and quite polite. However, i feel they kept asking our party if we wanted more drinks. I think their big selling point is on their drinks. It made me feel like I was in clubbing in the middle of the daytime instead of night time. It gave me quite wrong impression on this placeDo yourself a favor and try a brunch place that has great drinks, better food, and a better deal. It is definitely doable in this area!",0
"Overall, the food was good and the service was okay. I think they could've done a better job of keeping up with the demand and providing more Mimosas.",1
"I had a great time at Nippori last night. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I especially loved the chirashi dish - it was a great selection of sushi and the salad was a nice addition. The samurai ramen was also really good, and the black garlic in the broth was really delicious. The only downside was that the service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected in a busy restaurant like this. Overall, I would definitely recommend Nippori to anyone looking for a great Japanese meal.",1
"We came here for dinner as it was convenient and close to where we were. We'd been here years ago a couple times. The layout is the same but the menu is a bit changed since Mario Batali is not involved. They were nice enough to fit us in without a reservation as long as we vacated our table by 7:15. No problem. We are fast eaters and it was only a little after 5. When we entered the dining room, there were lots of empty tables. We ordered right away. One couple shared a chopped salad and the other shared an octopus appetizer. The salad was very good. For our main meals, we ordered tagliatelle with a Bolognese sauce. It was good, but the portion was minuscule. Another got eggplant parmigiana. She said it was good. Another got a special which was not described accurately by our inexperienced waiter. Everyone thought it was a pork chop with pasta, but it turned out to be pulled pork mixed into a ragu sauce. Again, the portion size was very small. I'd ordered a white pizza with mushrooms and cheese. It was thin and crispy and large enough for me, so I shared a couple pieces with the others who were still hungry. It was only 6:50 when our waiter brought us the check. We had the table for 25 more minutes -- more than enough time to have ordered dessert which we had wanted to do. But the waiter didn't even ask us if we wanted coffee or dessert. He was so rude that when he realized it after the fact, he made up some story about the people who had reserved the table running late. By then, we decided not to stay on principle. In fact, we went to another restaurant and had dessert.",0
"A 3 1/2 star spot that gets rounded up to 4 stars. The ambiance is very charming...a comfy, pillow-strewn spot with floral prints decorating the walls and tables in hues of tiffany-blue.The cocktails were the star of the evening: we had the kanaloa and spicy redhead, and both were great (albeit a bit on the sweeter side).The food:Striped bass - the crust was fantastic, and the caraway broth felt very soothingMushroom cavatelli - the cavatelli itself was ok, but the sauce was done well (a flavorful mushroom paste underneath a more traditional butter sauce)The service was very friendly and attentive. Made for a nice dinner spot and will probably go back to try brunch!",0
"I've been curious how this place was gonna be, it just opened up. The way it works is you go up, select what kind of pasta you want, they cut it in front of you there. After that you select your sauce and toppings. It's kind of like dig inn but for pasta. That being said, i'll give a breakdown.The pasta: The pasta was nice and al dente. It had good flavor. I went with fettucini. They cut it right there in front of me.The sauce: i went with the marinara, the person i'm guessing is the owner had a good attitude and seemed passionate about the food. The sauce itself had a very strong acidity flavor, not very sweet, i think it could have used a touch more sugar. But other than that, it was pretty good and better than some of the nearby places.The service: being that the place just opened, there was not alot of foot traffic. The staff was pretty nice. The cutting of the pasta i think is a great idea and a good niche, however If the place becomes popular i can easily see it will cause lines to be very very long and have trouble scaling. Other: Their choices of addins/ i found a little odd, they have meatballs which is normal and bacon bites which would go ok with a carbonara. However, they had roast chicken, but no sausage? I've never had or would even associate roast chicken with pasta. Imo they should either add sausage also, or replace chicken with sausage. Price: fettucini with tomato sauce came out to be about $10. Not bad.Overall: i'll be back, the place is definitely good.",0
"I have separate thoughts towards the bar and the pop-up, ""Him.""I don't have much experiences with bars (yet) but I would have appreciated to see someone greet us when we came in. A worker saw us come in but just ignored us, which is pretty rude. We had to physically flag down the waiter to find out we had to order at the bar and then sit down at a table. We ordered the Watermelon Margarita, and both the Dry Aged Burger and Washugyu Double Cheeseburger. The margarita was smaller than what I saw in pictures, but luckily, tasted pretty refreshing and how I expected it to be. The burgers were a much longer wait, but when they came, everything was forgotten.The Dry Aged Burger is a higher price for a reason: It was way more delicious than the Washugyu! I came mainly for the kimchi mayo and yes, the burger was definitely everything I wanted it to be! The rare steak tasted so creamy and juicy with the kimchi mayo and the cheese melted on top. I enjoyed it a lot more than the Washugyu Cheeseburger, which tasted too charred for me. The meat was salty and charred to the point that it felt too dry and hard to eat for me. Still love that kimchi mayo though! I would have appreciated better service from the bar but the pop-up is a success for me! I am happy ""Him"" is becoming an actual store soon!",0
"Decided to stop in here to grab a drink.  Pretty average price for beers. We were planning to sit upstairs but we could see someone who appeared to be doing drugs so we decided to stay downstairs. Luckily we did because a few moments later that person ended up smashing glasses which was a quite scary.  Additionally, there was a dog inside, which I am generally fine with, but when it was putting its paws up on the counter and trying to lick things, I worried about how sanitary that could be.",0
"Service was great, space was cozy, food was good. But the French dinner pace was just so so so slow that we almost fall asleep...My favorite was probably the complimentary dish, I forgot what was it but it was sunflower color, puree/foam form.. very refreshing and tasty.Sweet Bread - pretty good but nothing really special.Smoked Mackerel? - I thought it was really good but my friend thought it was too fishy.Duck - half of it was very tender and delicious but half of it has too much fat and was hard to eat.Pork Tenderloin - kinda boring and tough.Cocktails are interesting~",0
"I'm about a week out from having actually dined at Mimmo  Cucina Italiana. I had to double back and write this review. Mimmo is a nice sized restaurant with a full bar on one side and a chic dining area on the other. The place is bright with lots of art on the walls. When you walk in, don't be confused because the seating area is up past the bar. Mimmo also has a visible brick oven  just beyond the dinning area.

I will say, when we arrived, the restaurant had that fresh brick oven smell but it quick dissipated by the time we were served our first round of bellinis. I say that to say, if you get here when they first open as we did, be prepared for that. My friend and I enjoyed the bottomless brunch but we also had the opportunity to order other menu items as well. I had an Italian style omelette with the most amazing sausage and my friend had the steak sandwich. Everything was served hot and delicious. The service we received was stupendous.

I'm not always in the neighborhood but when return, Mimmo  Cucina Italiana will definitely be on my to-do list",1
"I had a decent time at this Mexican restaurant. The drinks were great and the food was pretty good, though it was a little bit pricier than I would have preferred. I especially enjoyed the la contenta nachos and the tacos de carne asada. However, I wasn't a big fan of the pollo en mole.",1
I usually only come here for the rice clay pots and the steamed rice noodles.  The bbq in the window isn't my favorite location (the bbq pork is too sweet). The pork and preserved egg congee is good but it's odd that they use minced pork. The fried chicken wings are miniature and not good at all for the price.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The omakase was a great value at $60, and I was really impressed with the quality of the sushi. There wasn't a single piece I didn't like. The chefs were friendly and the presentation was top notch. I would definitely recommend reservations, as this place gets really busy. The venue is a bit smaller than the pictures make it look, but it's still a great place to go for a sushi fix.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best. I've been here many times and it's always been the same. The prices are definitely high for the quality you get, and I don't think I've ever seen a more crowded restaurant. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.",1
"We did a takeout order via seamless from The Kunjip and the the process went smoothly. There was an extra 25% off for every first order. We ordered dukboki (rice cake) and dogani moochim (beef tendon), it came with complimentary sides which weren't good. The beef tendon was braised flavorful, soft and perfect with rice cake. The portion was really great and we even couldn't finish all in one meal with a very reasonable price.",0
"I had a great time at Chama Mama! The interior and backyard exterior are both really beautiful, and the food was amazing. I highly recommend the meat platter, mezze platter, and the egg and cheese pide. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the desserts, but that's probably because I'm not a big fan of sweets. Overall, a great experience!",1
"I really enjoyed our lunch at Sugarfish! The soup was really good and the price was great. I also really liked the lunch specials they had - it was a great deal. The only downside was that the noodles I ordered didn't taste very good to me. But overall, I thought it was a great lunch spot. I would give it a 3.5 stars.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was very good at this restaurant. The service was also good, though it could be a little more attentive. The table was a bit small, and I didn't appreciate not having a place to hang my coat. The noise level was a bit too loud for my taste, but it didn't ruin my dining experience. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"I've walked by this place so many times when I lived in NYC, always so many people. Finally made a reservation to come and did so on a weekday evening. Lots of people, sat outdoors. Asked for recommendations and was told the carbonara's the most known and popular dish, was also recommended the margharita pizza and bruschetta. Ended up getting spigola (seared bass) and carbonara. Both were just okay - flavors were light, food was fresh though. Pasta was a bit soft, didn't like it too much. Portions were small, service was acceptable (was given cups of ice on a hot day so I appreciated that). Was initially given the wrong bill, and the right bill came out to be $70+ post-tax pre-tip.",0
"This restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for some great Lebanese cuisine. The decor is a bit outdated, but the food more than makes up for it. The spreads and starters we had were all delicious, and the mixed grill we ordered was particularly good. The fries were also a real hit, and we would definitely recommend them. The only downside was that we didn't try the desserts, but we're assuming they're just as good as the rest of the food. Overall, we had a really enjoyable experience at this restaurant, and we would definitely come back!",1
"We had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The staff was so welcoming and helpful, and our food was delicious. We especially loved the lamb, which was cooked perfectly. The cheese culcha was a big hit, and the chicken tikka masala was also excellent. We'll definitely be back!",1
"Overall, I thought Vaucluse was a great restaurant. The dining room is very chic and beautiful, and the food was very good. The only downside was that the wait time for our appetizer was a bit long, but other than that, everything went smoothly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice restaurant to visit.",1
"I was really excited to try this restaurant because the line was long, but unfortunately, I wasn't wowed. I ordered a little bit of everything to try, but nothing really stood out. The presentation looked great and promising, but the food was cold. The service was meh, too. I don't know what all the fuss is about, so I won't be going back.",1
"I think I've found my neighborhood go to ramen spot!! We stopped by after a day out and was ready for some warm ramen. We were able to snag the last open table despite not having reservations. I started with the hot toddy which had star anise and yuzu, yum. Next we tried two of the rice cakes, unagi and beef. Both were delicious and beautifully presented but the eel was the better of the two. I decided to go with the classic tonkotsu ramen and it was perfection. Delicious broth, excellent egg, loved the thick bamboo shoots and wonderful noodles. Would've loved to try the shaved ice dessert if it wasn't the middle of winter lol. Nice outdoor setup, most seats are under a tent and heated. We were seated at one of 2 tables out in the open but there were heat lamps pointed at us.",0
"PURCHASED: 2x cocktails + 2x draftsTOTAL: $50PROS:+ 1920's vibe: waitresses and waiters are dressed in attire related to the era. There is a train car on top that requires dinner reservations. There are 2 divisions of the rooftop bar/restaurant, the drinking and the restaurant. The restaurant requires reservations. + Fire place: There is a fire place. We had visited in early June 2019. It actually got chilly and it was nice to be accompanied by a fire along with a nice drink. It warmed up the evenings. + good portrait location: Lots of greenery lines all areas of the rooftop. A photographer might find this location a nice place to shoot on a less busy day/evening. The sunset on the sky is not the best here (see below) though. CONS:- price: The price is just a tad high. I think the price could be lower since there are nicer rooftops that offer a greater view. - obstructed view of sunset: Not the 'best' spot for views of the city; there are better roofs in the city for that (see my reviews on the Crown, and the Press Lounge). Though, please note that my opinion is of the view and not the atmosphere. Overall, this location is incredible for intimate parties. IMPRESSION:Yes--it is a date-worthy location to take a date. But more so, it is better for taking older individuals to. I think they'd enjoy that more. The fire place surrounded with couches on all three sides and within a sort of tall bush that surrounds the fireplace is actually a nice place.",0
"I absolutely love Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles II for their delicious and authentic Chinese noodles soup. The broth is so savory and the noodles are so thick and chewy. I also love that they include a bag of hot sauce, chopsticks, and a spoon, which makes taking the food to go a breeze. The price is also very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic bowl of noodles!",1
"I was in the area and wanted to grab a quick slice of pizza, so I checked out this place near my Airbnb. The pizza was good - they had a two slices and a coke for $5.50 deal, which was a great price. I left full and happy.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was fantastic, and the service was great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The only downside was that the portions were a bit small, but that's to be expected in a restaurant like this.",1
"Overall, we had a good time at this restaurant. The food was above average and the service was good. However, I was disappointed that they apparently stole some of my lobster. I ordered two lobster tails, and when I put them together they were missing pieces. I didn't feel like they were very responsive when I brought this issue up to them, and it definitely ruined the experience.",1
"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely beautiful, and their menu is great for sharing. I got the smoked hummus, the chickpea and fava falafel, and the grilled eggplant. Everything was cooked perfectly and plated so prettily. It was quiet for a Saturday night, and the service was quick and warm. I would love to come back here for brunch and to try one of their desserts next time! I also definitely recommend their cocktails, especially the XYST Tonic.",1
Today was a spectacular day for my mother's birthday! The service was very quick and attentive. Staff is very nice and helpful in helping you understand the menu. The outdoor seating is set up beautifully and is very clean. The outdoor seating is set up better for small groups so this worked out better for a more intimate setting. I was very pleased with how neat everything looked. I wish I would've taken a photo of my Argentinian steak but I HIGHLY recommend that dish as well as Churros after. Everything was amazing and the drinks were phenomenal. I ordered a passion fruit margarita (which definitely did the trick and tasted great). Highly recommend this place.,1
Love the concept. A feast for the eyes. Need to go back because just got an empanada and wasn't really impressed.,0
Came here on a rainy Sunday morning and was warm in the outdoor seating. I enjoyed the service overall and would come again for brunch!,0
"I was not expecting Mission Ceviche to be as live as it was last night. The crowd of customers waiting for a table was spilling onto the sidewalk. Thankfully we had a reservation, but still had to wait about 10-15 for a table to be bussed and reset. Pro tip: look at the menu before you get here, and know what you want to order before you sit down. The reason for this is because the wait staff here seems to be stretched thin, so you really should order everything in one shot (dessert included) if you want it to come out in a semi-timely manner. Aside from the speed of the service, our waitress was very friendly and welcoming.The pisco sours were delicious and potent. I thought that the regular one was best.The aji de gallina was phenomenal. The chicken was succulent and the sauce was delicious. The white rice that accompanied it on the side was amazing too. For dessert, we ordered the white chocolate mousse  and it was great. Very light, and it complemented maracuya wafers and blackberries well. The food and the drinks were spectacular, but the speed of the service needs some improvement. 4.5 rounded down to a 4.",0
"Seafood fanatic over here and I'll give you my honest and truest opinion. We got the shrimp and crawfish combo in the (new!!) Tom Yum flavor with medium spice. I would HIGHLY suggest going lower in spice unless your tolerance is godly and you're unaffected by post meal bathroom runs. Thai people do not mess around with their spice levels. I wish we asked for more additions in our boil like corn, sausage and potato because I assumed they'd be included but it doesn't look like that was the case. The Tom Yum flavor was not what I expected but delicious nonetheless. The shrimp was cooked to perfection!! So delicious and no where near rubbery. The crawfish was small and dry, I was not at all impressed. Everything else was great. I wish we got to try more on the menu.",0
"This was the spot that was recommended to me by a local friend stating that their pizza blows all the other pizza places in the city out of the water. I think the best pizza I've had so far was from Buddy's in Detroit so I was truly anticipating on how Prince's would compare. It's definitely not the same style but Prince's does deliver in taste and quality in their own special way. We had a bite of the Prince's Perfection and the Pepperoni (both squares) and after finishing, right away we placed a mobile order for an entire 8-square pan of the Perfection to enjoy back at our Airbnb. Did I mention that this pizza tasted equally as delicious when cold?? Crazy! When we first arrived we did have to wait approx. 30+ min. You can only order full 8-square pans on Mobile Order via Slice, so if you're planning to only purchase singles you must get in line. I feel sad that I didn't take any photos before we devoured everything! Truly a must try while you're in the neighborhood - we cannot wait for our next visit.",0
"Prix Fixe Menu - 7/10Atoboy was $75 for 5 courses with some dishes being an additional charge. My favorite dishes were the appetizer, which is the tiny tiny donut, the octopus dish with sweet potato, the egg underneath the uni dish and the lamb main course. For the misses, the desserts were subpar, the uni was not super fresh and the yellowtail was unfortunately nothing special.",0
"So good! Came here with a friend and we got drinks and shared a few plates. It was super cute inside, the staff was friendly, and the drink list was great. We ordered the chopped salad, combo platter and shawarma. The salad was my favorite, and I don't usually say that. The combo platter was also nice if you want to try a variety of items and the falafel on it was really good.",0
"Really nice for us to make our dine in post pandemic restaurant debut at this nice neighborhood restaurant. We were kindly offered a table indoors or out. Since it is spring time at this time, we chose to sit outdoors and enjoy the experience of being marooned on an island with nothing to do but let the net drop to collect fresh fish from the sea and what for Easter to come to have lamb chops. Since we couldn't properly celebrate Easter this year as a family, these lamb chops came right on time and at the perfect temperature. Our server's well honed skills, like timing and cordial demeanor,  reflected the impeccable sharpening NYC has to offer to a professional waiter. The bill for 3 entrees and a large bottle of Pellegrino totaled 106$ + 20$ tip. My only complaint is that we really ended up with a full entree to take home with us. My mother kept saying that two entrees would be enough, but we rarely if ever listen to her lol (really not funny, maybe even a bit mean, no ... definitely mean).",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The salmon pan was really flavourful and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The only thing that I didn't love was that it was a small piece of salmon. I also ordered it with quinoa and salad and it was all really delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for healthy, delicious options!",1
"I went here last week with friend during happy hour, and we ordered the 10 mini tacos (half vegan shrooms, half beef), since I am vegan and she is not. The order arrived and we assumed the tacos with ground stuff was beef and the other ones were the mushrooms. I ate one of the mushroom tacos and thought it tasted strange, so asked the waiter to confirm - he said I ate the beef ones. I've been vegan for 10 years and vegetarian my whole life, so naturally I was very unhappy about this, and couldn't eat anything else, then had a bad stomachache for 48+ hours. The waiter was very nice and extremely apologetic, brought us a complimentary drink, and replaced our tacos with the correct order. Turns out he brought us the wrong order in the first place - they were both meat, but this cannot and SHOULD NOT happen. At the very least, they should always inform the customers which ones are which if they come out on the same plate.Again, the waiter was very nice and really felt sorry about this. The customer service was good, but this should never happen, especially in a place with so many 100% vegan options where it's easy for vegans to eat. I think the check should've been refunded in full, not just a complimentary drink. I would come back here again because the vegan food was good, but I'm just bringing this to your attention to always confirm which dish is vegan and which isn't, because if I had had an allergy, this could've been much worse.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant, but I would definitely recommend coming here with a group of friends. The bar downstairs was crowded, but I think it was mostly mid-20s-ers. The upstairs was much more tranquil and I enjoyed the ambiance. The food was really good, and I would definitely come back to try the food here. Overall, this is a great place tohang out and have some drinks.",1
"Had a few things delivered from here this weekend, which, compares to some recent Thai takeout and delivery we've had, didnt really meet the mark. It was just fine, more so spicy than flavorful. The pad Thai mun poo was the best of the lot, while the papaya salad and the larb were fine, and the sundried beef simply didn't travel well. I've had it in person and it was much better when hot and fresh. Wouldn't recommend delivery here but maybe in person would be good.",0
"I tried out this restaurant for lunch and I was really pleased with the two proteins bowl I got. The chicken leg was really flavourful and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The added charred avo was a great touch and really made the meal taste fresh. Overall, I thought the restaurant did a good job with the food and I would definitely come back for another meal.",1
"Craft is great, but Riverpark is way better. The food is amazing and the service is great. The only downside is that it's a bit of a walk from the train/bus station.",1
"Delmonico's is a classic restaurant that transports you back in time. The atmosphere is elegant and the food is delicious. The service was a bit lacking, but overall it was a great experience. The only downside was the price. It can be a bit pricey, but it's worth it for a meal like this.",1
"I visited this restaurant for lunch and I was really impressed. The tamales are the real star of the show, and I especially recommend the chipotle chicken one. The torta de quesillo was also fresh and fine, but sort of underwhelming in comparison. I'd definitely come back to try more on the menu, but I would definitely recommend sticking to the tamales.",1
"Full disclosure: Ramen restaurants that don't include a soft-boiled egg in their standard ramen irk me.  To me, a perfectly cooked egg is almost as vital to the composition of a good bowl of ramen as the broth itself, and to upcharge $3 for one is borderline criminal.  My suggestion to Ippudo?  Hold the bamboo shoots and pop an egg in there.  Ok, now let me get off my soap box.For years, I'd heard about the famous Ippudo, and had actually walked by the Astor Place location a million times without realizing what it was.  Because there are so many amazing ramen shops in NYC, I'd never made a special attempt to visit.  My friends and I visited for indoor dining during COVID, and I gotta say, it really didn't live up to its hype.  We had the pork buns, which were just okay in terms of flavor and tenderness of the meat.  The ramen was also not that special.  I had the classic tonkotsu, and found the broth to be a little boring.  The noodles were deliciously chewy and the chashu was tender, but the dish as a whole was a bit uninspired.  We also ordered a bottle of sake ($50) which was a nice accompaniment.  I don't know that I would go out of my way for a return visit, especially since they do not accept reservations.  But for an inexpensive meal of famous ramen, it may be worth a visit.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but some dishes were better than others. The highlight of the meal was definitely the halibut, which was cooked perfectly and had a great curry flavor. The downside was that some dishes were a bit too light and lacked flavor. The lotus rice was also not as good as I'd hoped, although it had a good flavor. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good meal that won't break the bank.",1
"The drinks were good but I really was not impressed with the food. The bar staff were absolutely fantastic and serve me up some of the best Old Fashioneds I've had anywhere.

For apps, my crew and I had some kind of buffalo chicken chunks as well as but I think we're mozzarella balls. Both were easily forgettable. The texture of the Buffalo sauce on the chicken was strange in a way that I just can't seem to readily discern.

For dinner, we had ziti in marinara sauce, chicken pesto, a fantastic mixed green salad (which everyone said was the star of the show... Kind of ironic a place known for its meatballs) as well as the namesake meatballs.

The ziti was not cooked al dente. It was unpleasantly chewy, and some pieces were still rather firm. The sauce lacked any real flavor. Ditto for the chicken pesto. I didn't try the meatballs because I'm pretty sure they had pork in them and I don't eat pork.

The stars of the show were the ice cream cookie sandwiches for dessert. They offered both chocolate chip and dark chocolate cookies which were both very good on their own, but a huge",1
"Overall, I thought Friedman's was decent. The food was decent, but I wasn't blown away. I would definitely recommend using the Yelp waitlist before coming here, as it can be very crowded and uncomfortable.",1
"I ordered a Sandwich De Puerco Asado via mealpal on a Tuesday afternoon and I seriously did not get what was advertised/ pictured.  It's described as a ""Latin Hero with Roasted Pork Mixed with Tropical Guava and Tropical Cheese served with Fries and Greens"".  What I received was a hero roll with pulled roasted pork in the amount of a slice of deli ham with no cheese in it nor was it press-grilled, a few pieces of frisee, steak fries, and a container of sauce on the side.  No ketchup, and bar napkins. 

I'm sorry to say that I was not satisfied with my sandwich. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. The pulled roast pork was in the amount of a slice of deli ham and there was no cheese in it. Also, the sandwich wasn't press-grilled which was disappointing. The fries were good though.",1
"I was so excited to try out COVID-19 compliant Kiki's, and I wasn't disappointed! The restaurant was PACKED, but the service was so attentive that I didn't feel crowded. The food was delicious and reasonably priced, and I especially loved the wine selection. I would definitely recommend checking out Kiki's during COVID-19!",1
"We were seated right away. The interior is bright and pretty with light wood and chevron marble floors. They asked us to scan the QR code for the menu. We went with the prime/mari package, lettuce ssam set and grilled mushroom plate. They setup the grill right away and brought the banchan and meats. The lettuce set contained a lot more than I expected. It included perilla leaves, endives, raw garlic, chili peppers, and carrot sticks. It was a great accompaniment to the meat. We liked the marinated short rib and beef belly more than the the sirloin and NY strip. Maybe due to the marinate, the meat was more tender. The grilled mushrooms were surprisingly great. Instead of grilling at the table with the meat, it came cooked on a creamy base. Definitely don't miss that. Cocktails were good too. I would like to try the lunch set menu sometime.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was really friendly and accommodating, letting me sit wherever I wanted. The food was delicious, and I especially loved the pappardelle with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes in a light cream sauce. It was quite filling, but definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"This was my first visit to Arturo's and I LOVED IT!! With its dim lighting and jazz music, this place seemed more like a nice dining spot than a pizza place, which is what I was looking for. They have a good wine selection, a pretty elaborate food menu and they do a half-and-half with the pizzas, which works pretty well with most groups. Even the bread they served was fresh and delicious! We tried the mussels in wine sauce and it went really well with the wine! The pizzas are good - not ""out of the world amazing"" but really good! I'm sure to visit again!",0
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The food was absolutely delicious and creative, and the service was wonderful. It can be a bit loud, but the atmosphere is always amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal in the city!",1
"The Leach location is always a fun place to eat, with their monthly specials always being great. However, I don't really like their regular menu items. The dumplings are really expensive, and I don't think they're very good. I especially don't like their lamb dumplings, which are some of the worst I've ever had. The sides are ok, but not worth the price tag. The Leach location is definitely worth visiting, but I would recommend going to Chinatown for better dumplings at a cheaper price.",1
"If only management tweaked a few things, this place could be amazing! The bar area is really modern and stylish, and the drink selection is excellent. The brunch special is also very reasonable. However, it took us a long time to get our food, and we didn't really have anyone checking on us to let us know. I would definitely consider returning for drinks, but I'm not sure if I would actually eat here.",1
"I had a pretty disappointing experience at this restaurant. The food was good, but the service was really poor. The lady in the front didn't even greet us, and the table next to us had to use their phone flash to read the menu. Overall, it's a 2-star restaurant because of the poor service.",1
"Great price Friendly service Food came out very fast testyBig menu we spent $47 before tip for two of us.Pho is very hot soup and yummy , all the beef come medium rare and tendon and omasa , everything in the bowl as you expected . Loving it",0
"PF Chang's is a great place to get your Chinese food fix. The food is always hot and fresh, and the shrimp fried rice is especially delicious. It's definitely worth checking out this location if you're in the area.",1
"I was pretty excited to see a Korean restaurant in Chinatown. I've been meaning to give this place a try, since the reviews here were pretty impressive.Very rarely does this happen, for me to disagree and go against the grain to this degree, but this is definitely not a four and a half star joint. I'm really having trouble understanding how the review ratings for this place are this high. Our meal was not restaurant quality Korean food. At best, this was bad food court food that resembled Korean food, in looks only.We came here for an early dinner on a weekday night. It was pretty dead in here. I ordered the beef soon doo boo and we shared the kimchi pajun. Nothing about this meal, I'd say was good. The banchan was tasteless, the soon doo boo was watery and not spicy or flavorful at all (I ordered the beef soon doo boo spicy, but it was pretty mild), and the kimchi pajun was dry and cardboard like.I was struggling with the rating, and although I was tempted to give this place one star, I gave it two, because at least the volume of the food was pretty decent and the host and hostess were pleasant. I was hoping this place would be a hit, but unfortunately it was a miss.",0
"The food at this restaurant was really mediocre. Skip the tuna poke, it is void of any sort of flavor and very overpriced. Guacamole was really good, probably the highlight of the meal. My burrito bowl was different from my friend's (hers had a sauce of some sort and mine did not) so I essentially had an entire bowl of brown rice with 4 shrimp and some pick mixed in, topped with tortilla strips. Won't try it again. The kitchen was extremely slow the night we went, but the staff was extremely apologetic and took a meal off the bill due to the extreme delay. Maybe they are still working out some kinks, but wouldn't put this on my hit list, and wouldn't recommend to someone looking for a really impressive meal.",1
"They have outdoor dining!  Love the set up with the twinkling lights and warm ambiance.  We were told that we only had an hour to dine even though it wasn't packed.  The servers were courteous and quick.  We got:Drinks - Green Lotus: 3/5. More on the sweeter side. Very refreshing, but not that strong.Tumeric Branzino: 4/5.  Loved how crispy the skin is. It also had a variety of toppings that came together very well. It is on the blander side though.Grilled Jumbo Shrimp: 4/5. We didn't know that these are wraps and not shrimp over noodles like the branzino is. My friends found it a bit hard to wrap and eat, so just ate it part by part. Great sauce.  This is more of a modern take on Vietnamese cuisine.  Presentation and ambiance was stellar.  However, the food is on the blander side.  I was hoping for the punch of flavor typically expected from Vietnamese food but Van Da fell a bit short.  While it is on the pricier side, the portions are pretty small and none of us were full after.  I'd recommend getting an entree and some appetizers.  Overall happy with the experience and loved the vibes!",0
"I can't believe this... they went from having the greatest Onion Rings in the world (totally homemade) to the worst - now they have premade frozen breaded crap that I hate so much. WORST ONION RINGS ON EARTH!Sorry to say but these people are real losers - that is they hate their own success. Also, one of the most inconsistent restaurants in Manhattan. It is fine for my kids weekly burger dinners, but beyond that - I will never order any food or myself.",0
"Open late, very tasty and cheap!! Definition of quality late night bite!Chicken shawarma was my favorite as well as the falafel. Ask for hot sauce if you like it spicy like me.",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The drinks were delicious and the service was great. The atmosphere was really cozy and the menu had a lot of options to choose from. I especially loved the complimentary bread and olives. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a fun night out.,1
"Avoid this place if you want good pizza. 
Think airport pizza places. You know, where they make whole pizzas in advance and then throw the slice in the oven. I ordered 4 slices for my nephew and me. 
I asked if they would heat them up. I was told they just took the pizza out of the oven. 
They hadn't. 
I had to ask the server for two trays when she tried to pile 4 slices on one tray. 
Sat down to eat and the pizza has no taste and a soft crust. 
Pure crap. 
So, one water,one can Diet Coke and 4 slices of meat lovers pizza....$30.76!!
My biggest regret of the trip to NY. 
I wish I had used Yelp first.",1
"3 1/2 stars.Was really looking forward to eating here but left underwhelmed:/We had the mozzarella pizza and Sicilian. The mozzarella was very thin and a bit bland. The crust was too hard to my liking but hubby refused to waste food and finished it for me. The person eating next to us also tossed his crusts into trash can..The Sicilian is a bit thicker and cruncher. I regret for not trekking to pizza suprema where I had really good pizzas back in 2019 when we last visited the big apple. I told hubby the pizza joint at JFK food court tasted better than what we had at joes. Unfortunately I guess ""artichoke pizza"" at jfk terminal 5 also went downhill big time so I decided not to get it and hence very sad this was the only slice of pizza I had during this trip :/ We went there Friday at noon and the line moved quite fast. Got to order within 5 mins. 2 slices and a coke cost 12.50 which was reasonable w/ nyc cost of living. It's a plus they don't impose mandatory tipping policy! Very rare breed these days! Maybe if we ever go back, we will try other flavors.",0
"Still staying true to the classic, traditional old school Italian menu and doing it well! Good Size menu, quick service and reasonable prices for the quantity Anna quality",0
"The samosa chaat was quite tasty and flavorful, but the portion was tiny. The butter chicken was not good at all. There was barely any seasoning, and it was very bland. I had to add more coconut milk and seasoning myself to make it edible. I'm disappointed since I'd read that this restaurant has a Michelin star chef. I'll be looking for a different Indian restaurant in the area.",1
Dined indoors one cold April night with friends on their recommendation.  They were attracted by the reputation of the Australian Chef and his cuisine.The food was good though I would quibble about the portion sizes - the starter with lettuce wraps was very good but two small pieces for $13 seemed a bit stingy.My principal problem was with the portion sizes combined with staff hovering every time a wine glass was near empty seeking to refill - I and my guests also think the measures poured varied.  In the end we bought a bottle to fill the glasses properly.This was a rare case of going out for dinner and then going home and cooking a pizza after spending $150/head on dinner.I would say though that in the summertime thisWould be a good lunchtime location for a snack and (work permitting) a glass of wine.,0
"I had a really good time at Obao. The service was a bit slow, but it was still enjoyable. The food was also really good - I especially enjoyed the lobster pad thai. The only downside was that it wasn't particularly spicy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Great value for a delicious and hearty bowl of ramen! The service was sooo fast and the staff couldn't be kinder. We ordered the chili chicken ramen and the spicy miso ramen (with shredded pork). The pork ramen was amazing - seriously, so much tasty pork and all the fixings on top of perfectly al dente noodles and heartwarming broth. The chili chicken, on the other hand, I struggled with. I've never been one to shy away from spicy food (or any food in general) but this one was too much!!! Shout out to all the heat lovers, this ramen's for you. When we told the waitress that the noodles were too spicy, she gestured to take the bowl away and asked which one we wanted instead. No fuss about it, she immediately offered to replace it and did not charge us for the extra bowl. I usually don't send food back so I was really glad she didn't give me a hard time about it!Now that's GREAT service and rare to find in NYC! Thank you kind waitress.",0
"Food was all right, nothing out of the ordinary, but I am  bothered by what happened two nights ago. We were sitting outside, without masks obviously, and they dropped off our food. One of my dishes they dropped off was the wrong one. A few minutes later they picked it up, said they dropped the wrong dish, and brought the right one. I didn't touch it and didn't have time to realize it was the wrong dish (both were veggies). What I wondered later, though, was whether they brought that dish to someone else?! After it was on our table for a few minutes and we were without masks?",0
"The wings at this restaurant were disappointing. They were small and lacked flavor. The beer menu was good, but the cocktails were not my favorite. The service was slow, but we weren't in a hurry. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"The outdoor patio at this restaurant was perfect for enjoying the weather on a Sunday. The pizzas were delicious, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The beverage menu is basic, but the staff is friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The bar is able to operate during covid, which was great for the winter time. The heated area was really great. The food was good, and I especially loved the spinach dip. The margarita pizza was just ok, but the portion sizes are EXTREMELY small. The drink was delicious, and the ambience was lovely. The service was fine.",1
"I've had good experiences ordering takeout from here and delivery has always been pretty good, but my recent dinner experience was not so great. The chirashi bowl I ordered was okay, but the salmon was very bland and the tuna had no taste at all. One of my coworkers who usually orders from here said he preferred his usual place, so I'm not sure if it was just an unlucky night or if this is a common problem.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The decor is really nice, and the staff was very friendly. I especially liked that they had a Seated app so that we could easily make our reservations. The food was also really good - I especially loved the chicken wings. The only downside was that the portion size was a bit small, and we ended up ordering more food. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"This is a 2 story steak house. We went around 6 pm on a Friday and made a reservation in advance. I don't think you would need a reservation around this time; there were not many people inside until about 7 pm. Before we were seated, we were told it is mandatory to coat check, but later saw multiple tables with there coats on their chair, which was annoying. We ordered the Traditional Caesar Salad ($17) as an appetizer. For the entree, we ordered the 15oz Cold Water Lobster Tail ($59) and the Filet Mignon 10oz ($51). The lobster tail was good, and we asked for it steamed instead of baked. The Filet was okay, could've had more seasoning. Overall, the restaurant is exceptionally overpriced for an okay meal.",0
"I really enjoyed the food at this restaurant, but the wait for our food and drinks was really long. We ordered around 6pm and we didn't get our food and drinks until like 6:45pm. Honestly, maybe they were short staffed or something but the food was good quality! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"This restaurant is a great find for a warm Tuesday night. The menu is a bit hard to gauge, but we ended up ordering the pickle sandwich, lamb ribs, and tile fish. The pickle sandwich was buttery and vinegary, quite different than any sandwich I have had but good in its own right. But after seeing other customers order the burger, I felt we had made a mistake in our menu choice. Next came out the lamb ribs. As we were sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen prep area, we saw them cutting the ribs for us. They had quite a large rack of ribs they were cutting and we assumed we would get 3-4 ribs to share amongst the 2 of us. We were shocked at the portion served to us... it was nearly the entire rack! Considering the price charged, it was an extremely good deal. The lamb ribs were fatty and flavorful - a great choice if you like smoky lamb. To be honest, the pickle sandwich and the ribs were more than enough food for the two of us but we had ordered the tile fish already so we tried a bit of that. The tilefish was served in a Japanese dashi ankake like sauce with zucchini. This was a nice fish but",1
"Curry goat stew is tender and falls off the bone just like it should. It has some spice, but it is not overpowering. The rice was a little overcooked, but still good when mixed with the stew. It also comes with roti but I don't eat roti. It is a great portion for the price.This place was packed. It's small, but probably worth the wait. I visited on a Thursday night and sat at the bar so I was seated right away. If you want a table you'll probably be waiting. There were a few outdoor seats. It's also hot inside, but in my experience that's normal for Caribbean restaurants; it's like they want you to think you're in the islands. The atmosphere is friendly and good vibes. My food came out quickly and hot, but not so quick that it seemed to be waiting under a heat lamp.",0
"The food was good, but not great. The street corn was a bit undercooked, but my mom really enjoyed the lobster taco. I loved the burnt ends brisket taco. The mojito and mule were also pretty good. Overall, it's a solid choice, but with so many phenomenal Mexican options in the city, it's tough to beat.",1
"I was really excited to try RH, but I was really disappointed in the food and the space. The LOBSTER ROLL was dry and the KALE CAESAR was bland. The beer was only $8, but it wasn't worth the price. The service was good, but I don't think I'll be back.",1
"I was happy to have the opportunity to try Little Park, the sister to the Dutch. The menu is extensive, with options for breakfast, lunch, brunch, and dinner. I sampled the breakfast burrito and it was delicious. The eggs and chorizo were perfectly cooked and the tortilla was soft and seasoned perfectly. The grounds are gorgeous, with gardens and a pond. I would definitely recommend Little Park to anyone looking for a delicious, healthy meal.",1
"Sooo this review is tough because this place is cute and I really wanted to like it a lot. The inside is very small so I opted for outdoor seating. The menu is trendy. I didn't like my sandwich. It was EXTREMELY GREASY. And it was such a thing cut piece of chicken that all you taste is crust and oil. It was very unpleasant. The spicy mayo was the saving grace. And the sweet potato fries! I LOVED the eggs which was surprising as no one really has a strong opinion about scrambled eggs- but somehow they made it that it's worth noting in the review.  My friend got the banter breakfast and wasn't impressed either.  She wasn't a fan of the mushrooms which she usually loves- and we weren't quite expecting the plate to be a bowl with the different items kind of just placed in there. It was odd. She enjoyed her matcha lemonade and my OJ was good. Overall, I want to say that I will go back, but chances are I wont. Sorry.",0
"Our experience at this restaurant was fantastic! The guajillo sauce served with the taquitos was amazing, and the tuna crudo was also delicious. The homemade chips and tortillas were also really good. The tamale was also yummy, and the fish taco was probably my favorite fish taco I've ever had. The birria was also really good.

The only thing I didn't like was the gringito. It had a lot of flavor but wasn't very smooth. The no manches was also good, but the birria was my favorite.

Overall, I really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant and I would definitely come back. The atmosphere is also really great.",1
Spectacular time today for my mother's bday! Service was very quick and attentive. Staff is very nice and helpful in helping you understand the menu. The outdoor seating is set up beautifully and is very clean. The outdoor seating is set up better for small groups so this worked out better for a more intimate setting. I was very pleased with how neat everything looked. I wish I would've taken a photo of my Argentinian steak but I HIGHLY recommend that dish as well as Churros after. Everything was amazing and the drinks were phenomenal. I ordered a passion fruit margarita (which definitely did the trick and tasted great). Highly recommend this place.,0
"The definition of Chinese fast food varies from person to person. I've had friends order pork fried rice and chicken wings with French fries with a side of duck sauce. Not close to what I had imagine, but to each their own. To me, authentic Chinese fast food is a super crispy roasted pig and soy sauce chicken with a nice golden glaze to it, don't forget the soy sauce, ginger scallion condiments and a side of veggie to complete the meal. All of this extraordinary goodness assembled within minutes is what I call food that I grew up with. And there's no better place to go than New Kim Tuong. I've tried many places but this spot never disappoints. Their prices are very affordable and the food is amazing. I highly recommend trying their food!",0
"Disappointed . Discovered memo way back in 2012, when I lived in brooklyn. I still feel the Kings Highway branch is awesome. We decided to eat here since everything else was closed. Super clean location and very bright! We placed the order and waited for an extended period of time, we got the lamb gyro wrap and mixed gyro platter. The gyro was so so bland! They also forgot to give us the white sauce and we had to ask for it. Some of the members in my party didn't receive their food till the rest of us had finished, so we ended up just taking it to go. They need to up their service and food!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The waitstaff was welcoming and the atmosphere was high energy and cheerful. The bench seating was really comfortable and I loved the strangers aspect of it. The food was delicious and the price to portion ratio was within standards. The only downside was that the ramen was pork-based, but that's to be expected at a ramen restaurant. Overall, I would highly recommend this spot!",1
"I've been here several times for birthday parties, dates, happy hour etc. It's a loud and lively casual bar with great deals. They host trivia during the week and have a $5 burger happy hour special; the burger is average, but for $5, who can beat it. I've also shared the nachos $12 with friends; the portion is large but sometimes they come out cold and soggy. The front of the restaurant near the bar has all standing tables but there are a few booths in the back. If you are lucky enough to get a booth, they have iPads at each table to order. It gets very crowded on Friday/Saturday night so arrive before 9:30pm. They have tons of board games scattered throughout the bar which are fun with a group of friends. Make sure to remember to check in on Yelp for your free shot (I have to remember next time!)",0
"Beyond Sushi is a great quick service option for sushi lovers in the area. The Spicy Mang roll was delicious and the watermelon mint lemonade was refreshing and delicious. The only downside is that the seating is limited, so it's best to come here if you're looking for a quick bite.",1
"This was the only restaurant I went to for restaurant week this year. The food was great but I knocked off 1 star because all the steak options on the restaurant week menu had additional cost on top of the restaurant week price. Why would I go to a steakhouse to get a pasta entrée? Doesn't make any sense. If price is the concern, then a smaller portion of steak would be preferable than an added cost to the prix fixe menu. The serving also wasn't large enough to warrant the added cost. The ambiance and service was great and all the food was delicious! The steak was perfectly cooked and the sides were lovely too. Our server was very attentive. I wasn't impressed by the dessert though and gave the dessert to my friend.",0
"We made reservations about a month ahead of time so I'm not sure how difficult it is to get a table last minute but we were seated right away at our reservation time. My steak was cooked perfectly and even a little crisp on the outside. The mashed potatoes were to die for. I've been to multiple nice steakhouses before and Keen's really didn't stand out as anything super special to me. I think if they had side options such as creamed corn, Mac and cheese or other things like that, I would've enjoyed it more than I did. BUT also, I am from the south so that might just be a difference between steakhouses in NYC and SC. Overall, the food was good and fresh",0
"Given the popularity and crampedness of the restaurant, I'm not sure exactly why mediocrity excites lines.Scallion Pancake (C) - The scallion pancake here is nicely textured and fluffed in layers. However, this was only served with soy which didn't match at all since the pancake was already savory. Some acidic and/or spicy dipping sauce would better elevate this dish.Shanghai Noodles (C) - The noodles are well cooked, but I feel like the dish is kind of mundane and needs to be elevated with some vibrancy. There is a few slivers of pork and bok choy mixed amongst the noodles, but it is pretty bare overall. It is well seasoned though, but rather expensive for strictly noodles.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The minimalistic decor is really chic and cool, and it gives the restaurant a really west village feel. Our waiter was from Greece, and he was really nice and made the experience really nice. We started with the revithia and saganaki, and I really enjoyed the saganaki - it was fried and had a different preparation than I was expecting, and it was also crusted. The revithia was a simple dish, and I would skip it next time. The beets were also simple but very flavorful, and for our entrees we had kleftiko and stuffed cabbage. Both dishes were solid and authentic, and the kleftiko was something you don't usually find at restaurants like this, and it was on the heavier side. The stuffed cabbage is an acquired taste for many, but for me it was really delicious with the flavors working together. The sour cherry dessert was also authentic and delicious, and I would definitely recommend it. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely come back.",1
"The wings were flavorful and the dry rub gave them a nice flavor. The steamed fish was good, but it didn't come with rice which I thought it would. The fish soup had a subtle earthy taste that was a good contrast to the fish. There were several bones in the fish, but it was still good. The service was okay, but I tried to get the servers' attention a few times and they never came back to me. I also asked another server for hot sauce and Thai chilies, but he never came back either. The food was okay, but I think we ordered the wrong things.",1
"I ordered from them online and they waited an ENTIRE HOUR and then canceled my order, I also called after I placed the order maybe like 6 times and NO ONE answered. Incredibly unprofessional - save yourself some time and go somewhere else.",1
"My crew came to DokoDemo this past Sunday to try their Japanese street foods. I remember bookmarking this spot when it first opened but surprisingly never having the chance to try it until today. The store itself is simple and well sized to fit approximately 15 people comfortably. The menu itself consists of four items so it was fairly simple to choose what you want without having to worry about a plethora of choices. We each ordered a different item out of the four main choices they had to offer. I had the takoyaki, and my other two friends ordered the pork ramen fried rice and the beef with cheese okonomiyaki. The food here is very good. It's a bit on the pricier side only by a dollar or two however the food does taste very authentic and made extremely well so I feel the price is justified. The portion of the ramen rice is enough for one hungry person and if not, there is always the choice to order another item on the menu. I would definitely come here again for another round of takoyaki and okonomiyaki next time. Solid eats!",0
"I had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is great, the food and drinks are delicious, and the music is chill but not too loud. It's a great vibe. I highly recommend it!",1
"The bowls at Inday NYC are a delicious and healthy way to satisfy your hunger. I sampled both the veg Indian buffet bowl and the miso salmon bowl and loved both of them. The miso salmon bowl is especially hearty and delicious, and the ginger miso dressing atop the napa cabbage and coconut summer beans is delicious and accents the flavors perfectly. The restaurant also offers a great selection of tea, perfect for enjoying with your meal.",1
"I had a good time at this restaurant. The tuna classic with the yuzu sauce was good, and the iced tea was great. The poke had a lot of large slices of onion, but I think that was because it was so good. The atmosphere was nice and the staff were friendly. The tall plant in the corner was cool. Overall, I would recommend this place.",1
"I wasn't a fan of crawfish before Sup Crab, their crawfish are a lot more plump and savory than any I've ever had. They've made me a fan! I am still dreaming of their crispy scallion pancakes dipped into their delicious sweet and tangy soy sauce. The super-group combo boil is great for a group of 4, each bag has lots of plump shrimps and a large buttery crab (if chosen). The potatoes and corn sucked up all the flavorful boil marinade and made the meal complete. I am definitely looking forward to trying the rest of their boil options!",0
"I had a great time at Coppola's restaurant yesterday! The atmosphere was very calming and I thought the food was good. The meatballs were tender and flavorful, and the baked clams were tasty. However, the shrimp was a bit hard to bite off from the tail and the shrimp scampy was delicious. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely visit Coppola's again!",1
"I visited this restaurant a few weeks ago and found that the sauce was lacking in terms of flavor. Granted, it's been awhile since the last time the sauce was updated, but I feel that it needs a bit more oomph in order to compete with the other restaurants in the area. Overall, the food was still good, but I'll likely visit another restaurant in the near future.",1
"The speakeasy vibe is everything here. It was a little tough to identify where the restaurant was from the outside, but that all goes into the vibe. The prime rib was excellent as well as the service - Brandon was really great. My only caveat is eating so late at night, our res was at 12:15am and we were so weak - lots of leftovers happened, but they all tasted good the day after!

The English cut prime dip - the cuts of meat were thin, but perfectly cooked with a nice fat/meat ratio. The horseradish cream was a great pair with it. There is also a seasoning you can dip it in that was really good!

The French onion dip - not on the menu, but can ask for it and this was recommended to us from Brandon. It's a large sandwich with thinly slice meat and then a dipping sauce with it. It was really good and was a really easy to pack to go.

Cacio Pepe Carbonara Pasta - this dish resembles much more of a carbonara than a cacio pepe. I was really excited to try this fusion, but sadly, I didn't get any cacio pepe notes - there was barely any black pepper here.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant for brunch! The skirt steak sandwich on a Portuguese roll was delicious and my friend had 2 baked eggs in a green tomatillo shakshuka sauce. The portions were a little small, but that didn't bother me. The place was packed and there were many groups waiting outside for a table when we were leaving. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and I'm sure I'll be back soon! 4/5 stars.",1
"Wow, Rubirosa is definitely worth the hype! I've heard such great things about this place for a while, but it's always been fully booked that I've never been able to try. We finally got a chance to try it on a weeknight and I'm so glad we did! We got the Tie-Dye and Rubirosa Supreme. I definitely liked Tie-Dye more, as the flavors complemented each other well. Supreme was more basic but was definitely more filling with the meat and veggie toppings. The crust was super thin, which I prefer. The service was a bit slow, but all was forgiven as soon as we had our first bite of the pizza. Can't wait to come back!",1
"It's 9:30 in the morning and after a long night out, I still managed to throw on some clothes and head over to Prince Street Pizza.  I frequent New York quite often but never have enough time to get to all the places I want to eat at.  There's just never...enough...time!  But I made it a point to wake my behind up to come here.  I get there and it's 9:55 am.  There's a line already but not too bad.  The place is small, decorated w/framed pictures of celebrities who have visited the establishment.  Makes the time go by faster when you have something to stare at.  Twenty minutes later and the line starts moving.  I'm the eighth one in line.  Yes, I counted.  I've never been so eager to get my hands on that famous SOHO square cut pepperoni pizza.  I'm actually not even hungry at this point.  It's literally 7'ish am on the West Coast and I'm still stuck on Cali time.  It's my time to order. ""Can I get that square cut pepperoni pizza?""  I ask for a baggy, snap a few pics of the famous square cut pizza and head back to the hotel.   By this time the pizza is cold already but now I'm actually hungry.  I take it out the bag and see double cups of crisp pepperoni.  The dough...thick.  I'm a thin crust type of gal but non-discriminatory.  I take a bite out of the pizza and WOW!  The sauce was flavorful, the crust...chewy and good.  The pepperoni...ohhhh the pepperoni, was heavenly!  Each bite was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  It's those darn pepperonis I tell you.  I will never look at pizza the same way.  PSP will always be a must-have when ever I come back to the big Apple.",0
"I visited Wild for brunch as a vegan dining with a vegatarian, gluten-free eater and a flexitarian, and found the experience to be good. The restaurant was not busy at all when we arrived, and I had the tofu scramble, which had a nice mix of vegetables in it and the smoked tofu was a nice variation from the usual turmeric style tofu scramble. The potatoes that came with it were delicious, and even though I eat gluten, the toast was pretty good. My dining companions enjoyed their huevos rancheros and the gluten-free person was really pleased to have the French toast. Service was fine, nothing remarkable either way. Overall, this was a solid experience and I'd be happy to go back if I'm in another mixed group again.",1
3 1/2 stars.   Always have to have soup dumplings on our visits to Chinatown. Tiny Shanghai in a small restaurant that specializes of n dumplings and noodles. Be aware that when you order Soup Dumplings they can take 15-20 minutes to prepare and will probably arrive to your table later than other items you have ordered. Perhaps they do not have enough steamers?We shared several dishes. The Fried Tiny Buns were good but I have had better. (I believe the tiny buns we lived were at Shanghai 21).  The Beef and Broccoli was tasty but the dish contained minuscule amounts of beef.  The Beef Lo Menu was very flavorful. The soup dumplings were very good. I like both the crab & shrimp and blank truffle & pork. I am not sure if the Truffle & Pork was worth the extra five bucks but I am glad I tried it. This is the first place I have gone to where soup dumplings took so long. The place was good but there are are restaurants for Shanghai style cuisine that I like better in Chinatown.,0
"I had a great time at Dim Sum Palace! The variety of dim sum and Chinese entrees was fantastic, and the restaurant was very crowded and noisy. However, I was able to hear my friends across the table easily. The only downside was that the food was a bit dry.",1
"I stopped in last night to Anthony Bourdain-worthy Heidelberg and I was not disappointed! The wait staff was dressed in traditional German getup - suspenders and all. Our waiter was very prompt and friendly and I ordered a Spaten lager to drink. The beer itself wasn't even super cold, but it tasted amazing. I had the Jagerschnitzel as an entree and it was so hearty and flavorful. The buttered pasta on the side was really good as well. My friend said that he enjoyed his smoked pork chop and we also shared a gigantic pretzel that comes with a delicious cheese sauce. We skipped dessert, but I took up the waiter's offer on a schnapps. They had the longest list I've ever seen! I chose the mint one and it was strong, minty, and sweet all at the same time. It did settle my stomach nicely though after all that beer and food. I would definitely return any day, week or month of the year!",1
"*takes reservations**no tipping restaurant* Small hole in the walls rarely ever disappoint, and Izakaya is just another great example of that. Chicken Nanban - very juicyAddictive Cabbage - indeed addictive, and refreshingAddictive Cucumber - refreshing and yummyThick Salmon Sashimi - good sized pieces and freshYakitori skewer - yummyIzakaya Pudding - kind of like flanMatcha Brulee - personally I wish this was a bit more bitter",0
"Went here because we had a food coupon we didn't want to waste. Went around 11 in the morning so their breakfast counter was shut. The place is okay with a buffet area and made to order counters that are open at different times. They seem to have little bit of every cuisine. The food counters are okay price wise but the buffet and on the go items are a total rip off ($3 for a cup of yogurt? , no thank you!). Ordered the scrambled eggs with toast, instead got an omelette (too lazy to scramble 'em eggs bro?). The buffet items were heated with steam from the bottom so basically they were barely warm. Some tables weren't clean and the floor definitely needed some cleaning. I'd say breakfast is the only worthwhile time to go here. Avoid otherwise.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The atmosphere is really chill and modern, and the inside seems really spacious. It's connected to a hotel, so apparently there's a rooftop there as well! One star off for the server's lack of attentiveness towards the end of our meal, but otherwise everything was great. I especially loved the chips and guac with salsa, the pina colada and the ribs (with the delicious green salsa). The shrimp salad was a bit too salty for me, but the shrimp were cooked very well. The tacos were decent, with good flavors. The ribs, on the other hand, were ridiculous - just the right amount of fat, seasoning and tenderness, and they were served with the delicious green salsa. My pina colada was creamy, not too sweet, semi-strong, Smokey and yummy! Overall, I would definitely come back here when I'm in the mood for Mexican food.",1
"The Smith is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The cocktails are creative and delicious, and the desserts are especially delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fun and relaxing night out.",1
"The 1920's vibe of this rooftop restaurant is really cool. The waitstaff and waiters are all dressed up in 1920's attire, and there is even a train car on top that requires dinner reservations. There are 2 divisions of the rooftop bar/restaurant, the drinking and the restaurant. The restaurant requires reservations, which I thought was a nice touch. The fire place was a nice touch, too, and it was really cold outside so it was nice to be able to warm up with a fire along with a nice drink. The downside is that the sunset wasn't the best here, but overall this location is really incredible for intimate parties.",1
"There is honestly nothing I can complain about here. From the second I walked in, I was greeted by the owner (I think) and he showed us to our table. He made sure we were all set and took our orders. The service in general was very great.I think the the ambiance and the inside of the restaurant was the real stand out here. It was very beautiful and elegant. Very romantic and intimate. It felt like a place someone in a movie would have their first date. Very classic. The food was great as well! Our waiters brought out some pita chips and a very tangly vinegar based dipping sauce. I wasn't a fan of the chips because they tasted too stale. I got the spinach and cheese samboski which was very crispy and had a very juicy filling. I also got the beef hummus which was very creamy. The fat from the meat added a depth of flavor to the dish. It was a little pricey for $17 though. I got the combo platter for the entrée. It came with rice and roasted vegies. There was also a white yogurt sauce that also had a strong vinegar taste to it. The meat was very juicy. Chicken was great. Filet mignon was wonderful although more on the well done side than medium. Beef kebab was pretty standard. I would recommend this place for a nice night out!",0
"After the failed attempt to get AYCE bbq at 6pm on a Friday night, my friends and I came here and was seated immediately.Ordered the set for 3 people (which will run you $150) and a drink each. Our starters came out almost immediately and our server brought out all our raw meats to cook in front of us shortly after.Food quality is great but I think on the pricier side. It definitely has a good ambiance and there's even a dj by the entrance playing all the good song from the early to mid 2000s rather than your modern day EDM.Total was $75pp with tips so $225 total for modest amount of food and drinks.",0
"Wanted to celebrate the lunar new year right so my friend and I decided to go to Chinatown for dinner and some exploring after work. After walking around a bit, we decided on 456, as she had heard good things about it and there didn't seem to be that long a wait. After waiting 20min like we were told, we were ushered in and were able to immediately place our orders. As basic as it is, we went for the fried rice and sesame chicken. While we both wanted to be more adventurous/authentic, we didn't really know what that constituted, so we went with what we know and love. The food came out quickly and it was great. Nothing amazing, but exactly what I expected to get from a place like this. I am sure that their other specialty dishes are worth writing home about!The service was great and fast like I mentioned, so I'm giving this place 5stars for their efficiency and doing the staples well! Hopefully one day I'll come and try something new!",0
"I absolutely loved my experience at Onieals! The location is perfect - it's right on a busy street but it's also relatively quiet. The staff was friendly and the drinks were delicious. I especially loved the Kentucky Tea - it was so strong and perfect for starting the night off. The calamari fritti was also a great starter. The only downside was that the brussel sprouts were a bit disappointing - they were served in a small dipping cup and we were a bit surprised by the amount of spice in the penne vodka. But overall, I would definitely recommend Onieals to anyone looking for a great night out!",1
"No complaints here. Service was fast and prices are reasonable. I got the curry chicken sandwich and asked for it to be spicy. Chicken was juicy, sauce was flavorful, the veggies tasted fresh, and the bread was crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. Although I think next time I'm going to ask for it to be extra spicy, because I think an extra kick would have been good.",0
"I always love trying new Chinese restaurants when I am in NYC and I was excited to try Hunan Manor because it was only a few blocks from my hotel. The order time showed it would take a little under an hour, so I didn't think much of the delay. 35 minutes later, my food was being delivered and it looked and smelled amazing. The only downside was that they forgot my white rice, but the chicken was super crispy and tasted great. The pumpkin rolls were not what I was expecting, but I still enjoyed them. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience and would definitely return.",1
"I cannot believe Grandma's Margherita Pizza doesn't have a hundred rave reviews, let alone a Yelp page until just now. We moved into the neighborhood a few months ago, but this is the best pizza we have had in NYC let alone the neighborhood.It's not a cheap $2 slice place, but the large $20 speciality pizzas are well worth it.-They use super fresh ingredients -The crust is fantastic- FRESH HOMEMADE CHEESE - Always on time delivery (or early) - Sauce is a lil sweet, in a great way- clean, well run family restaurant -delicious carrot cake We always order the large Margherita pizza It reheats super well",0
Great value and gives out free meals for birthdays! Always a fun place to go out with friends!,0
Does anyone else think it's weird that the waitresses are dressed in Indian clothes wearing chanlos?? It's a bit insulting. Food was alright but there's better places on the upper east side. It can get loud with the birthday celebrations and busy for dinner without reservations. I wouldn't go back and definitely don't think it's necessary that their staff wear Indian clothes.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant, especially because of the great views! However, the customer service was really bad. I had to leave before I even ordered my food, because the staff was so rude. Maybe they only serve people who look like they can afford to eat here, but I personally wouldn't recommend this place because of the poor service.",1
"I want to start off by saying the service here was perfect, the cashier was very friendly and helpful. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and acknowledged before I walked out.I had the vegan pizza along with the vegan mozzarella sticks. I was really excited about the mozzarella sticks but once I bit into them the cheese was cold and not melted whatsoever. I don't know what happened with the mozzarella sticks but I wouldn't order them again. However, the pizza was delicious, I actually forgot it was vegan, it literally tasted like regular pizza.(which is a good thing) There was only one option for vegan pizza and that was the plain cheese, I do think they should add more vegan pizza options, other than that I would definitely  come back for a slice.",0
"This is a great diner. It has that classic diner smell and feel. The food was amazing, and I especially loved the pancakes. They were crispy on the edges, firm on the outside, and fluffy in the inside. The bacon and sausage were great, too. The ham was a little thin and felt more like a sandwich cut, but all in all this is a great place to get diner food. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I visited this restaurant based on the menu listing and was not impressed. The Mighty Mushroom Roll (a vegetarian sushi roll with rice, mushrooms, and tofu) was exactly what it sounded like--a plain, bland, and unappetizing dish. The Spicy Mang Roll (a vegetarian sushi roll with a combination of textures and a cayenne sauce) was innovative, but it didn't taste very good. The Five Spicy Chick'n Dumplings were also quite thin, and the chick'n filling was tasteless and had a texture that was similar to tofu. The restaurant has an upscale, classy atmosphere, but it was stuffy and too hot inside on a hot day. The service was nice, and the restaurant has a restroom in the back. I would not recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Great tasting authentic Mexican food! Had the chance to enjoy their ""Chicken tacos a la lomita"" and was not disappointed. Their horchata is also realllllyyy good! Some places make theirs too cinnamony or sugary but here its perfect.",0
"Kitchenette is a great place to go for breakfast. They have a great variety of pastries to choose from, and the service is always Prompt and polite. My favorite dish here is the Farmhouse Breakfast with cheese grits and buttermilk biscuits. The sausage is also great, and I would recommend ordering it if you're looking for something hearty. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my experience at Kitchenette, and I look forward to returning soon!",1
"Pretty solid American Chinese fare at reasonable prices. I usually opt to get the Sesame Chicken or Chicken w/ Broccoli which are both very good. The latter is pretty oily though (despite it being on the ""diet"" menu), but I suppose that's not really unusual for this type of food.I also recommend the Fried Rice options and the Fried Chicken Wings are surprisingly tasty. The Egg Drop Soup isn't bad either, but if you order it later in the day, it'll be much less fresh and will have a noticeably greener appearance.Note: One thing that frustrates me is that it's very difficult to understand the staff when ordering in-person. I understand taking COVID precautions, but the plexiglass wall they set up at the front counter has better soundproofing than my brick-walled apartment. They seem to be aware of this and use a mic and speaker to communicate, but the sound quality is much akin to that of 1970's police radio chatter. I've gotten used to it at this point and just half-shout my order which does the trick.",0
The only plus for this restaurant was the outdoor seating. The dim sum was below average and the service was confused.,0
"I went to this restaurant with some friends for an early dinner and we were all pretty disappointed. One of my friends arrived super late but they did hold our table, which was great. However, I saw reviews on poor service and I can say that was definitely the case when we went. Our server came by to check on our table a few times but that was it. The food arrived hot but we all agreed that the portions were really small for the price. The chicken lo mein was good but the others said theirs was better at their local Chinese food spot. Overall, I would say this restaurant is OK but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1
"Fieldtrip definitely deserves all of the hype it's been receiving (see New York Times review). JJ Johnson created this fast-casual restaurant in the hopes that it'll be a community spot for to get nutritious food, and it's been executed perfectly. Fieldtrip specializes in rice bowl dishes. All of his rice is non-enriched, non-bleached, and directly sourced from farmers. However, this isn't a build-your-own bowl type of restaurant. JJ crafted each bowl with unique flavors, and you can't go wrong with any order.I came in on a Sunday afternoon, and they unfortunately already ran out of the braised beef and salmon. I opted for the shrimp bowl, which consisted of sticky rice, toasted coconut, and green curry sauce. It was absolutely delicious, with very unique flavor arrangements. The quinoa bao buns are also a must-try! I'm not used to any bao buns without any meat, but these buns were pretty extraordinary. They came with mushroom, corn, avocado, cilantro, mozzarella, and yucca chips. The crunchiness of the yucca chips perfectly complemented the soft bun and quinoa patty. The dragonfruit lemonade was not only pretty to look at but also balanced between sweet and tart. Everything is relatively affordable, and the service here was very hospitable. I'd definitely be willing to make the trek uptown to try the braised beef or crispy chicken rice bowls!",0
"I came here with my whole family and omg, every single item was to die for! Artichoke chaat- very flavorful, crispy, Cauliflower - absolutely delicious, SPICY, unique flavor. Does not taste like your ordinary Manchurian Chilli cheese toast-  toast, with onions spicy chillies and sauce. SO good! Truffle khichdi- very unique, Pumpkin curry- a little dry for my liking But the taste was phenomenalPaneer makhani- so good, I have tried paneer makhani at all the Indian restaurants.. this one has to be my all time favorite!Their mock tails are all delicious and unique  too, would recommend trying their homemade ginger ale and pomegranate drink! Would highly recommend trying this place! The staff was wonderful and the portions are filling. Will definitely be coming back!",0
"The food here wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The drinks were really good though, and the atmosphere was really cute. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual place to have a drink and some appetizers. The service was okay, but not great.",1
"I really wanted to love this place but i can only say i really liked it. Warning: this location is super small and it gets packed quick! I have been here over the summer and it's not a good idea lol. Like I said, this location is very small and it gets super steamy quick. I decided to give this place another shot during the winter time and I think because it's so small, they seated us really close to another couple. As the couple started to leave, they had us move inside so another group can sit on the outside. I mean, I understand you need to get your money and all, but i was just uncomfortable. He always gets the mega and i got the spicy one i forgot the name lol and they were both very good. But their eggs aren't the best i've had in my ramen days. It could've been more flavorful. At the end, we had finished our meals first but waited for the group who sat next to us to leave so it wouldn't be such a hassle to ask them to get up in the middle of their meal. I was just not comfortable here and I am pretty sure that made my dining experience less appealing.",0
"Empellón Al Pastor has grown on me, to the point that I'd consider it among my favorite bars in the East Village. The margaritas are deliciously fresh, beers are cheap, and the food is worth writing home about. The mezcal margarita ($12) and the spicy cucumber margarita ($14) always hit the spot. If I'm feeling cheap, I'll get a pint of whatever lager is most affordable, or do a beer+shot combo. That'll definitely kickstart your night's festivities. Then there's the food, which somehow gets better each time I go back. I'm still fond of the hamburger taco and the namesake taco al pastor, but these days I always try to get whatever special menu item happens to be rotating through the kitchen. Last week it was a fiery hot taco with Carolina reaper/ghost pepper salsa, this week it's a brisket burrito with rice, Fritos, and queso. Check Instagram if you're curious; new specials every Thursday. Don't be an asshole and the staff will treat you nicely, simple as that. This is a great place for drinks with friends, bites with bros, casual hookups, and chance encounters. Ask for the bathroom code, and don't forget to tip your bartender.",0
"Noooooooo!!!!!!!!! It saddens me finding out the infamous, to some, Gyro II has shuttered their doors after 45 long years of business. Unbeknownst to me the demise took place over a year ago, which makes it even more heartbreaking. My first introduction to a gyro happened at Gyro II. Clueless, is what I was to the Greek tzatziki sauce consisting of Greek yogurt, cucumbers, lemon juice....sour notes. The owner, for whatever reason, decided to stray from the traditional by creating his own sauce of: (Calculate Conversion)MayoVinegar SugarDill WeedStir, refrigerate, serve. His creation, garnered a divide of half who loved the savory, sweet concoction and half who preferred the traditional. My introduction as a young buck with a very immature palate, easily fell under the former category of the divide.  Now here we are in 2019, with the exclusion of another staple to the 34th Street area. Like so many other establishments that had a long foot hold in NYC, it's an era lost.  Thank you for your decades upon decades of business Gyro II, you will be sorely missed.",0
"I had a great time at this place! The service was great, and the food was even better. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some great Italian food.",1
"Bryant Park Grill is a great place to enjoy a view of Bryant Park from the rooftop. The decor inside and outside of the building is on point, and the food is decent. The service could be better, but the staff is kind and welcoming. Overall, it's a bit overpriced, but it's a great place to visit if you're looking for a day in Bryant Park.",1
"I went with a chicken roll after being super indecisive, only to hear most people ordering the meatball hero. Ill have to come back and try that one or any of the parm hero's which seem to be the most popular items here. My roll was a little over cooked i wasn't too happy with the chicken and the oven heated it up way too slow, it seems like just the outside was warmed up. Kind of odd. Overall this place gets super busy around noon. Not a bad option for lunch.",0
"The Ragtrader Bo Peep is a great place to come for a drink before heading to Caroline's for a comedy show. The drinks are strong and the food is delicious. I had the Tailor of Panama along with the Scallops, and they were both amazing. I wish I had taken a picture of the scallops because they were SO delicious.

"I visited Taco Dumbo last week and was disappointed with the service. I ordered the 10 mini tacos (half vegan shrooms, half beef), but found out after eating one that it was actually the beef tacos that I had ordered. The waiter was very apologetic and replaced my tacos with the correct order, but I feel that this should not have happened. It is easy for vegans to order incorrectly and not be aware, so I think the check should have been refunded in full. I would visit Taco Dumbo again, but only if the service is good.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The barometer for me was drunken noodles and they were perfectly spicy, for me, though they are happy to accommodate any level of spicy. I can confirm it is indeed BYOB, which we love! The interior is really cute and it is decorated very cozy! I particularly enjoyed the red curry with chicken. Perfect for cold weather and it is so very flavorful!!! I will be here often!",1
"This is one of the few Thai restaurants in Chinatown. I enjoy the curry dishes here. Just enough spice for me.It is a relaxed atmosphere, and the service is efficient. The place is not terribly busy as they get the crowd from the government buildings nearby during the week. I would think those on jury duty would frequent the place, as the Vietnamese places down the street typically are favored by this focus group. A good bang for the buck, as they say.",0
"The food here wasn't good at all. I ordered the shoo shoo burger and it was really dry and the bun was really hard. The fries were also really dry and over-fried. The burger patty was also really small. Overall, I wasn't impressed at all.",1
"I went to Bar Belly with coworkers for their happy hour and it did not disappoint. We made a reservation and I would definitely recommend one because it was very busy and it's a pretty small venue. It's a narrow but long restaurant.

We were a pretty big group of 6 people and despite our reservation we were initially seated at a 4 person table. It took a lot of convincing the hostess to move us to a larger table. We ultimately were moved after ordering 4 dozen oysters that didn't fit on our table.

We picked bar belly for the $1 oyster happy hour and the oysters were amazing. Fresh and sizeable. We ordered 3 rounds of 4 dozen and it took about 20 minutes between each round to have the oysters shucked. The oysters were definitely the highlight of the night.

The fries were also very good and had seafood seasoning that made them addictive and we ordered 3 rounds. The happy hour drink selection was basic and we opted to get their signature cocktails. Our group ended up trying at least one of each and they were all delicious. Burnt love, dead witch, invisible woman, knight rider were crowd favorites.

I did order a mango #5 but something in it had a",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch today and was really impressed. The service was great and the atmosphere was really relaxed and comfortable. They have all day drink specials which was really nice, and their wings are really good. I also really liked their IPA's and the tv's with sports were a nice touch. It's a great place to go if you're in the area and looking for a relaxed lunch or dinner.",1
"I am usually a big fan of Beyond Sushi but have never visited this location. I ordered in advance on the app thinking that the establishment was fast casual and that there would be a seating area for me to consume my food, but when I arrived to pick up my order, they told me that the restaurant was ""dine in experience only"" and I would not be allowed to consume the food there, but they would make a one-time exception and allow me to eat at the bar. They didn't even offer me water. The sushi was also not as good as other locations - the rice was kind of hard and the rolls fell apart when I picked them up with chopsticks.",0
"Finally, I was able to come to this restaurant and try their sit-down food. I have been looking forward to it for a while, and I am not disappointed. We arrived, and the hostess was nowhere to be found for at least 5 minutes. The bartender finally asked if we had been helped, and retrieved the host. Even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes until we were seated. Once seated, we waited awhile for our waiter to come (my boyfriend went and got us water and silverware himself). Finally ordered, our waiter was super friendly - you could just tell the restaurant was severely understaffed. It looked like there was one waiter and one busboy for all the tables! The host was in the back helping clear tables while explained her absence.

The food was awesome! We got the French onion soup as an appetizer. My mom and I split the roast chicken with stuffing and brussels sprouts. My boyfriend got the special meat pie which was steak and mushrooms with chips. Sticky toffee pudding for dessert was delicious as well! The food could have been a little hotter (maybe because it was sitting for a bit before getting served), but overall, not a big deal.",1
"I had a great time at this cute little rustic restaurant. The omelette I ordered was delicious and didn't need any salt or pepper. The side salad was also fresh and tasty. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the banana bread was delicious. This restaurant has been in business for a long time, and it shows in the quality of the food and the friendly atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was friendly and engaging, but not over the top, relaxed and enjoyable. The food was excellent - I especially loved the meat, which was cooked perfectly. The side dishes were also great. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I've walked by An'Nam a bunch over the years going to theatre or other restaurants nearby, but didn't go there until recently. I'm always a little wary of Asian fusion restaurants that have multiple Asian cuisines, because it always seems like they don't do all their cuisines that well. An'Nam has Chinese, dim sum, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese food on their pretty big menu.I can't speak about the other cuisines they offer, but my friend and I got some sushi rolls and I also got the Age Tofu, and we enjoyed our food! And the prices for said items were very affordable, too, so that's always a plus, especially in the Times Square area.We were in a bit of a rush, too, having a show to go to (but luckily across the street). I wouldn't say our food came out quickly, but it wasn't too long, and we had enough time to eat comfortably, and they brought our check pretty quickly after we asked for it.We also were able to sit in their outdoor dining area, even though they didn't have their heat on and expected everyone to dine inside. But I'm not comfortable with indoor dining at this time, so I'm very glad they allowed us to sit outside nonetheless, and we kept our winter coats on and it was fine. And we were the only ones out there, so it felt pretty safe COVID-wise. So, I thank them for that.Great service, decent sushi rolls. I'll be interested in trying some of their other food items sometime in the future.",0
"Since the City has begun to open up following the pandemic, there seems to be a new dim sum spot opening outside of Chinatown every week. Hey Yuet in Chelsea is part of this trend. Unlike some of the newer dim sum restaurants, Hey Yuet delivers traditional dim sum selections that provide excellent quality and wonderful flavors. The service is terrific too. Hey Yuet will likely be a survivor among the many good dim sum options.",0
"Ok let's start with the hostess super nice, the bartender while we waited for our table was amazing it all began when we were seated our waiter seemed to not want to be bothered let me explain, being from out of town my husband always asks the staff what others are eating and what they personally eat at the establishment and for the most part we get great recommendations this guy was not interested he said Oh I don't know, check the menu and when my husband asked what's in the omelet he pointed to the menu again and said it says it there, he didn't return after he took our order to check if we needed water or anything someone brought our food which was semi-cold as though it was sitting there for him to pick up I did see him assisting other tables just not ours... he finally appeared at the end when we were done and had ordered dessert from the awesome hostess who saw that we were getting the cold shoulder from him. I did make a comment and said ""Oh there you are right on time like a bill to collect my money thought your shift was over"" he could tell I was annoyed and tried to say something but I had tuned him out at that point. The food is good the cheesecake is decadent",0
"What a cozy, romantic place.  Found this for Restaurante week and went on a weekday for dinner for $59.  Three courses with options and none of them were disappointing.  Sadly, they were out of the initial wine choice but did have my second in stock.  The service was good, and we had reservation starting at 6:30...we ordered dinner around 7 (part of the party was delayed) and we didn't leave until 8:30.  I ordered he mushroom truffle soup, braised short ribs and s'mores bread pudding for dessert.  The rest of the group ordered the Branzino, Duck, tuna tartare (they substituted salmon as they were out of tuna) and the trio gelato.  I only tried the Duck which I thought was delicious.  However the braised short ribs where the best out of the four dishes.  The s'mores bread pudding was super rich...wow.  Thankfully they gave vanilla gelato with it to help cut that but it was still rich.  The trio gelato was the best for dessert as you got vanilla, chocolate and strawberry.  I'd totally go back to try other items on the menu.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The margaritas were delicious and I tasted the mango and guava (the guava was my favorite). I also loved the guacamole. The food was flavorful and everyone enjoyed their meal. I want to try the margarita tower next time! I got distracted talking to my girls, but I'll be sure to snap photos next time!",1
"I was really excited to see all the homes in dyker heights decorated in extravagant lights and other Christmas decorations. Unfortunately, I was not very pleased. I live in Chicago and there are many suburbs nearby that have significantly better decorations.  I was honestly shocked by how many homes in dyker heights that were not decorated. It seemed like 3-5 homes per block were decorated. I would say overall there were only 4 memorable homes. I was hoping for more Christmas joy than I experienced. Not too sure if this was normal or if less people decorated this year. Besides the big homes, the decorations were very average.",0
"Love this place! I typically come here for happy hour ($5 wines - from Wolfer might I add - and $4 bites), but today I tried it for lunch for the first time and it was amazing. I had the octopus shared plate, which was the perfect size for my main meal (it was a hard decision between this or the octopus tacos - next time)! My dad got the quinoa salad with chicken which looked phenomenal (and it must have been because it disappeared so quick) and my mom for the kale Caesar which also looked quite good for being a fairly traditional salad. Will definitely come back for dinner (and happy hours) again soon.",0
"The UES has a great new addition in the form of Ramen House. The cocktail menu is different and delicious, while the different ramen noodles are not vast but each well made. We ordered the shiso/ daikon and earl gray cocktail. My husband and I enjoyed both but were pretty bummed that the shiso cocktail came in such a small teacup. The whole concept is cute but you can finish the whole drink in like 3 sips. We got the Kyoto and Hokkaido ramen. My husband really enjoyed his Kyoto ramen saying the broth was great. I liked the Hokkaido ramen but personally thought that it tasted too strongly of corn. I love corn but it over powered the taste of the broth. The noodles in both dishes were a perfect texture and everything was put together perfectly. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Ramen House and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Server was nice. Grits were great,  but have been here over an hour and fifteen and have been served one dish and wine:(  the other negative reviews on here seemed overly judgmental, but we are like probably going to have to leave because it's taking so long. Neg reviews about service are somewhat right. The grits were great though and excellently flavored. Also try the Wade Cellars Rose if you are into Rose.",0
"I picked up lunch here with the $1 Ritual app deal. I got the pan fried classic dumplings. Loved the flavor of the dumplings and the 2 sauces that came with them. My one complaint is that every time I bit into a dumpling, they came apart at the seam making them very difficult to eat. The restaurant itself is very small with only a few counter seats. Service was good and my order was ready on time.",0
"I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. The waitstaff was nonexistent, just as other reviews stated. The hostess were nice, but nothing against them. The food came out relatively fast, but if you need anything or have an issue, you will not find a waiter around. A quick disclaimer, there were some who brought food to the table who had a great vibe and were nice. Overall, the food was meh. Definitely not worth the price. The quantities are small finger food sizes and the taste is overwhelmed with extensive heat and spice. The chicken skewers had one small pineapple chunk on each skewer, which was disappointing. The experience wasn't the greatest and music was so loud you can't have a conversation at all. I won't be returning here. 2 stars for the ambience, but no stars for the food.",1
"The food at this restaurant is absolutely fantastic - and the prices are great, too! The Crispy Rougamo appetizer is something you won't regret trying, and the QiShan noodles are a real knockout, with a delicious spicy szechuan sauce and a delicious umami sauce. The atmosphere at the restaurant is really fun and whimsical - perfect for a casual dinner out.",1
I'm really sad to hear that Gyro II has closed their doors after 45 years of business. I remember going to the restaurant when I was a kid and it was one of my favorite places to eat. It's an era lost and I thank them for their decades of business.,1
"Mixed experience. Had lunch at Patrick's prior to a nearby theater performance. Drinks were good, tho I would recommend the excellent $8.50 Bloody Mary over the ""special Brooklyn"" $13 gin & tonic. The Sigmund Hot Pretzels app was excellent, two large crusted pretzels served with dipping sauce. However the main courses fell short. Neither of us got sides with our sandwiches so we shared a side order of so-called French Fries which were actually greasy circular chips. My Montauk tuna sandwich was bland, small and priced at $23, inflated even for the theater district. Cheesecake dessert was stuffed into a cup and covered with sweet jam, not my fave. Our server was pleasant but very busy, and the place didn't employ any buspersons when we were there, so we ate our dessert with dirty plates on the table that hadn't been cleared away.Our overall experience OK but not sure I'd go back.",0
"We called ahead to order for pick up. The food was ready very quickly which was good. The pierogis were good, lots of different flavors but could use a little more flavor. The latke was good crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. The blitzes with raspberry sauce was so delicious. The cheese goes perfectly with raspberry and it's so light!",0
"Dallas BBQ wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't great either. The most memorable part of my trip was the mimosa cocktail I had, which was very refreshing. The food was mediocre, though. The ribs were tender, but the sauce tasted like something they order in bulk somewhere. There's nothing distinct or special about the flavor. The shrimp were plainly fried and there was no special house dipping sauce. The side salad was presented without the dressing I requested, and our server didn't come back so that I could ask for it. The cornbread was from a burnt batch, hard and dry. I would come back for the drinks, but I wouldn't recommend the food here.",1
"Overall, I thought the bar service was good. The drinks were reasonably priced and the piano was a nice touch. The only downside was that the drinks were a bit too sweet for my taste.",1
"Came here on a Sunday night at midnight, being that it was one of the only places open in k town at that time. The place was pretty popping given the reviews on Yelp, again probably due to being the only place open at the time. They serve food ranging from all different types of Asian cuisine.I ordered the Jjampong which cost around $19. The soup itself had very little flavor, almost tasting like water with a tiny amount of gochujang. The seafood itself was fine, but the tofu for some reason was very cold. This made the overall soup lukewarm, even though I had started eating it right when it arrived to me.I also got to try the pho and the Jajangmyun. The pho barely had any noodles and way too onions and the broth itself also did not resemble pho broth in the slightest. It kind of tasted like pork bone broth, nothing like beefy. I would not be surprised if they used the same soup stock for all their broth based soup dishes and altered them slightly. The jajangmyun, which was ordered spicy, was not spicy at all and also came out kind of cold.I would not recommend coming here if you have other options. The only redeeming quality is the $10 soju with the purchase of an entree (which may or may not be worth given the quality and price of the food).",0
"It was probably about 40 degrees with horrendous winds when I saw the Brodo Broth Co. cart. There are five broths; Chicken, beef, hearth, seaweed + mushroom, and The kind gentlemen spared several minutes to give me a sample of each broth!I went with the Seaweed Mushroom and Chicken broth with no add-ons. Simply delicious and homey feeling; sorta like having your grandma's soup. There are plenty of reviews here that say it is too salty or rich but if you grew up in an Asian household like I was, this would be far from the truth. Be prepared to shell out a few heavy dollars for a small cup of this broth. If you are debating, don't. You were going to spend $11 on a smoothie anyways.",0
"Bodega Negra is a great place for dinner or drinks before going out. The service was excellent and our server Lawrence was very attentive. We each had one app, tacos and one drink and got out for less than $50 per person. I had the Skirt Steak tacos, the Grilled Corn Salad and tried the Yuca Fries and the Sweet Plantains (plain without the cheese or crema) and everything was delicious. I also asked for a custom tequila drink which was great. I would definitely recommend Bodegra Negra for a fun and affordable night out.",1
"This is a really cute seafood place. The indoors looks like you are on a boat. Food was fresh, I really recommend the sushi. I give one star off because they did not give us king crab in our seafood plate even though it was included (especially in the price) and if we did not notice they would have charged us for it, which felt a bit dishonest. They did eventually bring it to us but again we had to ask.",0
"3 stars for super friendly staffs, location, wheelchair friendliness and decor. But the sushi itself isn't great. But they do serve Brooklyn Kura and nice HH drink deal. So it's a nice place to catch up with a friend who doesn't want to meet at coffee shop or dark bars",0
"I can't say enough good things about Little Rascal! It's definitely been one of my go-to spots in SoHo over the last 2-3 years. I'm so glad that they've made it through the pandemic!The cacik is so so so good. Please get this and thank me later. Almost every time we go, we split the trio of dips (hummus, Babaghanouge & cacik) and always end up getting an extra side of cacik. The wine is a decent price for the area, and the vibe is great!Pre-covid it was a dimly lit cozy environment, and now- mid-covid, they have a nice outdoor area with heaters! It's a big white tent with quite a few tables, pretty lights, table decor, music. The staff is always incredible and really help set the tone! We went back in February for my birthday, and they offered my party blankets to keep us cozy while we sat outside. They were also accepting reservations which was very helpful! All in all, 10/10, love it, tell your friends, run don't walk. Love this place. My roommate and I call it ""our spot"" because we love it so much. (Cute, am I right?) Anyway. See you soon, Little Rascal (seriously though, I got a gift card for my birthday- best gift ever, so I'll be back soon)",0
"Decent dumplings, but for the price (spent 28 dollars for 16 dumplings) it didn't feel entirely worth it.We got 2 plates - the Mimi Cheng dumplings (boiled, 8 pieces) and the reinvented classic (pan fried, 8 pieces) and ordered for dine in.Our first plate came promptly to our table - and then we proceeded to wait 10+ minutes for our second plate. When I noticed people who were in queue way behind us finishing their meals and leaving the restaurant, we finally went up to the front counter to discover that they forgot about the second plate haha. Once they figured out the error, they were very quick to serve us the second plate (noticed some of the dumplings were not 100% cooked through but not too noticable).Anyways, the dumplings are made fresh and taste homemade, and the secret sauce was interesting - Id say it's worth visiting if you've never been here before.",0
Went here with some buddies a month back for a get together. I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of food/taste compared to other NYC steakhouses at that price point. Regardless it was nice to chop it up with the boys that I haven't seen in a while. They gave us a private room which was a nice surprise considering we were a group of younger guys. In my experience when a group of younger people enter these kind of establishments the quality of service is a little lower but I wouldn't say that here. It was nice to go to a historic steakhouse but I would be interested to try others as this is more of a special occasion price point for me and not a regular spot. Would suggest going at least once to cross it off your list.,0
"This review is long overdue! I haven't been to Jacob's Pickle in a few years so I was excited to go for my birthday this year and it did not disappoint. I believe our waiter's name was Jacob (?) who helped us out tremendously. He was so kind and funny too! If you haven't been here before: Come on an empty stomach. Big Portions!! I went ahead and got the vodka lemonade which was so refreshing! Food:Baby Back Ribs w coleslaw and potato salad: 5/5I don't know what to say it was really all that I was wanting. The slaw?!?! My god it was tangy but not too mayo'e and just had the right amount of shoosh oh it was divine for slaw. Potato salad slapped. The ribs were falling off the bone. Chef's kiss. Bread Pudding: 5/5I got this little number in celebration of my birthday which is actually a behemoth. I literally can't describe to you how this tasted. It was like cornbread and pound cake had a fluffy baby?? Would like to be included for my ""Last Meal on Earth"" Vibes: 5/5If its a nice day I'd definitely say try to grab some seating outside! Its quite nice and the restaurant can be kinda loud. Loved my experience here. Will come back of course. And I'd recommend getting a reservation :) Cooley Complimented",0
"Great service, good seating, mediocre food. Nice spot for a date! I want to give this place a higher. Rating, I just didn't enjoy the food, but other factors compensate for this Food: I came here for brunch. I ordered the omelette which has spinach and goat cheese, which tasted good! The fried chicken sandwich was just too fried. It didn't have much flavor, even though it was suppose to have a kick. If you like really fried things. Similarly, the hash brown pancakes were so fried, that it didn't even taste like anything but oil. Service: the service is great! The servers are so much fun and very attentive. I really enjoyed their energyAmbience: this is a wonderful place to have outdoor seating during covid. It felt very Parisian because the table had seats in facing  outwards. Lovely spot for 2 people. Also this is one place that actually feels heated! I was actually nice and warm because of the heat lampSafety: decent amount of outdoor seating available. The servers wear masks. They don't overfill the place with people",0
Weird. Not clean. No COVID precautions. Nothing is labeled s you have no idea what you're eating. The best thing was the potato salad. The jerk chicken was dry and not tasty at all. Avoid!,0
"TLDR: gonna give this a second shot later, but for now the only thing I would recommend was the crispy pata.As a west coast transplant that grew up in a large Filipino community (and a Filipino myself), I was excited to find a Filipino restaurant in my neighborhood! I ordered the chicken inasal, crispy pata, and lumpiang Shanghai. I was quite excited for the inasal; my family is from Iloilo and I often ate it as a kid. Unforunately the chicken that I had today lacked the charred grill marks and Smokey flavor that is characteristic of inasal. It was also tough to eat because sadly it was under. Crispy pata was truly the star of the show. Honestly anything deep fried is delicious! I love the crispy skin and the gelatinous texture of the meat. The lumpia was okay as well, but I think you can pass on them. I think the worst part of the meal was the soggy rice. Rice is a staple in Asian cuisine and it saddens me that it was so soggy. Not sure if they tried the batch of rice that they were serving, but it was pretty wet it was borderline lugaw.Service was a little slow. Seemed like they were backed up in the kitchen but the staff was apologetic, kind, and friendly. Everyone was wearing masks and the tables have hand sanitizer on them. I want to like this place, so I'm gonna give it another shot in the future!",0
"I had the chicken and spicy pork dish at Bowllin' and I wasn't impressed. The pork was very fatty and the rice was not particularly purple. The place smelled really bad and the ventilation was really poor. The staff looked really bored and uninterested in their jobs. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food and would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"We had a wonderful time at this Thai restaurant! The menu has a great variety of dishes, and it was easy to come with a group and to share several dishes. Between the 6 of us, I'd say we sampled at least half the menu, and for a reasonable price. They had a decent beer and wine selection as well. The pork belly, the short ribs, and the larb were all big hits. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a low key Thai experience.",1
"Appetizer~Baked Clams and Shimp~Meatballs Entree~Shrimp Scampi~Black Linguine w/ shrimp, scallops, topped with crab meatDrink~MoscatoYesterday I went to Coppola's. I really liked the atmosphere. It was very calm. I thought the food was good. Nothing to rave about though. I don't really like meatballs but tried my friend's own and it was tender and flavorful. The baked clams were tasty and so was the shrimp but the shrimp was a lil hard and took a bit to bite off from the tail. Shrimp scampy was delicious and my black Linguine sauce was alright.",0
"This is my second time here. Service is good. All day drink specials. Good wings, IPA's and tv's with sports. The vibe is relaxed. Plenty of seating. Close to the seaport and almost every train line by Broadway and Nassau. If you are in the area stop on by.",0
"3.5 to 4. Pretty good for being vegetarian I'd say. Service was attentive and checked in often. Water refills were pretty frequent for how busy it was. So my friend decided to join me here as the one wholely vegetarian restaurant during the trip as consolation for all the other places we went to by her choosing. I wanted to try a few different things out of curiosity. We had gotten an order of the Fun Guy dumplings, shishito peppers,the Chic Pea and Sunny Side roll, black garlic ravioli, and an order of the cauliflower. My favorite things were the black garlic ravioli and the fun guy dumplings. The rolls tasted kind of the same to me eating them. They were still tasty though despite that. The cauliflower was tasty, but I wanted more of the sauce along with it honestly. I think the shishito peppers were the only thing that kinda fell through the cracks. The amount of peppers was very little, and the flavor was lacking with mostly char coming through. Everything else worked pretty well though. It was a bit pricey overall, I'd probably check out other vegetarian places first before popping in again.",0
"I was so lucky to stumble upon St. Tropez while looking for a bar to meet a friend. The dimly lit interior, hanging lights, and woodsy setting made me wish we were there instead, but the long walk was worth it. I ordered a Beaujolais and the roasted plum tomatoes added a delicious sweetness to the wine. The flaky pastry was perfectly done and the wine was smooth and balanced. I also enjoyed the tartelette aux courgettes the couple next to me was enjoying. Overall, a great experience and I can't wait to come back!",1
"Dined in on a Weds. around 2pm for lunch and boy was I not disappointed!!! I ordered a crispy chicken taco which is a chicken tender, a fish taco and a side of rice and beans. Total meal including a bottle of water was about $14. The staff was very friendly, food looked & tasted fresh and the overall place was very clean. The flavor of both my tacos were amazing! It was definitely not what I was expecting. The style of ordering your food reminds me of Chipotle, HOWEVER the taste is totally different. I will definitely be back here as I now have another lunch spot to add to my list. I wish them much success as the food is great and decor is very inviting.",0
"I had a great time at Restaurant Week takeout at this restaurant. The portions were huge and the beef bibimbap was really good. I should've measured out how much of the provided sauce I poured over because it ended up being too spicy, but otherwise everything else was great! The galbi jjim was less good though. The marinade was overly sweet and the short ribs were either overcooked or undercooked. I was also expecting chestnuts, dates, or radishes, but none were present. The sides/banchan included tofu stew and cabbage kimchi, radish strip kimchi, and steamed broccoli. All were really good. Overall, I had a really good time at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it.",1
"I love old school Chinese food and this place does a great job of recreating that experience. The waiters are attentive, but not overbearing, and my water never went low for over a minute. The only downside is that it is very busy and the line out the door can be long. The food is fresh and the rice rolls are very thin, which I love. My favorite dish was the pork liver, which was cooked well and seasoned well. The shrimp and chives were nothing to write home about, but the fish dish was good. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nostalgic Chinese meal.",1
"I had a good time at this restaurant, although the food wasn't particularly great. Our bartender/waiter was attentive and the brisket was soft and tender. The mac and cheese was delicious, and the serving size is definitely for two. I also appreciate how it's a non-tipping place because they pay their employees more, but we still tipped. The only downside was the pulled pork was extremely dry - had to drench it in BBQ sauce, which wasn't that great either. Otherwise, I'd recommend this spot for an evening out with friends. The bathrooms could use some improvement, though.",1
"The best wontons in town, and the noodles are forgettable. However, the wonton soup is very affordable and the service is efficient and fast. The price is also reasonable.",1
My friend and I came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and were seated within 10 minutes. The space has a bar in the front with some tables and a larger space in the back with more tables. We ordered the shoyu ramen and the spicy vegetable ramen. The flavor of both of them was excellent. The spicy vegetable ramen has very good spice (don't get it if you are not good with spice). The pork in the shoyu ramen was excellent and melt in my mouth. The noodles were chewy and delicious. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the food I ate proceeded to give me bad food poisoning. My friend was fine after having the spicy vegetable ramen. I am sure it was my dinner that made me sick since my other meal that day was a catered lunch that was shared with others at work and everyone else at work was fine. Really unfortunate that I got sick since I loved loved the food and the space/ambience. I would perhaps try the place again since the vegetable ramen was very good.,0
"I absolutely love Wisefish for their great poke bowls! They always have fresh ingredients and the variety of toppings is great. Plus, the price is great compared to some of the other places I've tried. The only downside is that it can be a bit small and crowded, but overall I really enjoy it.",1
"Zazzy's is a great spot for vegan and plant-based eaters alike. The menu has a great selection of vegan options, and the prices are reasonable. I ordered a slice and the mozzarella sticks, which were both delicious. The location is convenient and near many other vegan spots, making it a great option for vegan diners.",1
"Le Sia is a great place for a quick bite. The skewers are especially tasty, but the portions are a bit small. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the other menu items.",1
"Like the original location in chelsea markets this ""sister location"" should be a new york institution like Katz. It is imho the best place to land a taco in NY. Everything is fresh. Everything is authentic. Everything is made on the spot no bagged tortillas around these parts. Staff and the lack of seating (they offer stand up tables) keep everything moving. Its impressive how quickly they serve up the amount of mouthwatering food they do so quickly. If you're in Times Square there are an abundance of tourist traps and overpriced fare. Los Tacos No. 1 has to be one of the best things to get in the area.",0
"Came here for lunch and it was good! I got the tuna classic but with the yuzu sauce instead of the shoyu. It was good but had way too many onions for my taste. I checked in on yelp to get the free housemade iced tea and they had passionfruit green tea, which was awesome and unsweetened, which I love! The poke had quite a lot of large slices of onion in it, which I found to be too much, but the food did come out really quickly and I liked the vibe of the establishment a lot. They have a really tall plant that reaches all the way to a skylight, so cool!",0
Stopped by as I was walking near Union Square and decided to try! This spot is yummy and fresh! The pitas are super yummy and they even include a few fries inside your wrap. The service isn't like some other places but it wouldn't discourage me from visiting again. It's mostly a spot to pick up takeout and head home.,0
"The brunch at this restaurant was good, but a little pricier than I would have liked. I got a scramble egg popover, which was tasty but not really that special. My friend ordered an eggs Benedict, and it was also just okay. Overall, the brunch place is decent but not really worth going out of your way for.",1
"Update: I went back to 3 Times the next day (I was coincidentally in the area), and Paul was so nice! He instantly remembered me and my beef and broccoli lol, and he got it prepared as soon as he could. In addition, I got white rice, and this yummy jar of seasoning to go along with my beef and broccoli. The beef and broccoli was much better than the previous two dishes. It was tender and saucy, though still pricy compared to your average Chinese takeout beef and broccoli. The service here is amazing, though!",0
"I found my favorite place for pizza, but this place's pizza wasn't the best. The pizza was a bit small than other places, and the tomato sauce and cheese were enough. However, I wish the pizza had more mushroom. The dough was thin, not oily, and very savory, but a bit tough to chew. The delivery service was amazing, and they delivered my pizza on time.",1
"I absolutely enjoyed my quick walk-in brunch at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was great. I had the Truffle Burger and a mimosa and it was absolutely delicious. The burger was juicy and soft, and the truffle slices added a delicious flavor. I'll be back!",1
"I was hesitant to try this place given that it's a bit pricier than other steamed rice roll places in Flushing and Sunset Park, but I was pleasantly surprised. The portion was generous, the shrimp were extremely fresh, and the rice roll was delicious. The service was pleasant, and the atmosphere was nice. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.",1
"It was our first time here. First of all, the decor does look outdated, like some people have commented here. Instead, think about it as going to your Lebanese grandma's house. We felt welcome from the very beginning! We started dinner with some spreads - hummus with lamb, babaganouj and labne. They we all so good! The labne was one of the best I've ever had. The bread was also warm and fresh! We also had the kibbeh nayeh, which was delicious! The meat tasted super fresh and the spices were on point. The fries were amazing, we devoured them. We ordered the mixed grill, which had lamb, kofta and chicken. The kofta was our favorite! It was so well seasoned and you could tell the meat was high quality. We skipped dessert but they do have great Lebanese coffee. Definitely recommend for some legit Lebanese food!",0
"This place was ok. I'll be honest, I usually remember the foods I order but this was so not memorable I have no idea what I got. Well definitely two different tunas. Mango which I paid extra for but still got a tiny amount. I felt like the portion size looks like it's a lot but for $17 it's not that great a deal",0
"My family and I went to NYC for vacation and my cousin took us here for dinner. When I first saw the name, I thought it was Thai food. Nope it was Vietnamese food. Don't let the name fool you, the food was amazing! Apparently President Obama ate there and there's a dish named after him. I can see why he loved this place as well as my cousin who are regulars. We got fried spring rolls wrapped with lettuce and a dipping sauce. I now have to eat my spring rolls this way. The shell had an extra layer to it. Man the crunch on it is amazing! Must try!The Pho bowls are huge and has a ton of flavor! Again must try! The service was fast and everyone was friendly. It was quite busy, which I understand why! If you are pho lover in NYC  this is the place!",0
"Wanted something simple and they couldn't even do that. Line wasn't too bad, from walking in until getting my food took about 20 minutes. Ordered platter #3 and two plain bagels with butter. Had to reorder the bagels again. Plain omelette, nothing special about. Place was a little crowded... didn't see anyone validating vaccine cards. They wore their masks half way on and didn't see anyone wearing gloves",0
"I went here with my 5-yr-old niece and family for an early dinner on a Saturday.  We made a 5 pm reservation, requested a table outside along the sidewalk, and were seated promptly when we arrived.  Our server was friendly, service was prompt, and the food was really good.  I'm sure you've already read in other reviews that the biscuits are TO DIE FOR, but it bears repeating!!  I have great respect for any business that can make a light, airy, Southern-style biscuit outside of the South!  These were sublime, and even though we gilded the lily by slathering them with butter and strawberry jam, they also stood up just fine on their own flavor-wise!I also enjoyed my big bowl of Matzo Ball Soup, with two pillowy, light matzo balls, large chunks of perfectly tender vegetables, and a tasty, if uncomplicated broth...it's basically what you expect from matzo ball soup!I stole several bites of my husband's fried chicken, and man, was it good!!  So crunchy, and a hefty portion!Being able to sit outside in the casual environment of the sunny street meant that my niece didn't get bored, it wasn't excessively loud or crowded feeling, and there was great people-watching!  Sadly, I never went inside, so I can't report back in this case about wheelchair-accessibility...I'll check next time I'm in town!  This is a solid restaurant with tasty food, reasonable prices, good-size portions, and friendly service...what's not to like?!",0
"I was really pleased with my experience at this restaurant! The reviews were not wrong - they have Indian and Indian fusion with Chinese cuisines. The place looks chic and the service was good. The food was delicious - perfect amount of spices without being overly salty, which most Indian places tend to be. The portions were not very big but enough for two people to share. We ordered two appetizers and a lamb dish and the flan for dessert. That I wasn't too crazy about. It was very dense and thick. However, I'm definitely coming back to try other dishes.",1
"This Chinese restaurant delivers well in the middle of the night! The sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and shrimp fried rice are both great, and the prices are reasonable.",1
"Overall, I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The chicken tatsuta-age was cooked well and the sauce was a bit bland for my taste, but the pieces were large and the noodles were generously portioned. The spicy niku broth was a standout, with a lot of flavor but not too heavy. My girlfriend enjoyed the curry broth, though I felt it was a little watery. The short ribs were tender and the honeycomb tripe added a unique texture to the dish. Both eggs were perfectly poached. The shiitake was also delicious - it's marinated/preserved in some type of sweet soy sauce and has a very firm texture - but we were a bit surprised we only received one piece each. All in, I'd be happy to return and order the Spicy Niku again with the same add-ons.",1
"I had a great time visiting Sophie's Cuban Cuisine in my neighborhood! The food was good, and the customer service was amazing. Everyone was helpful and polite. I especially appreciate that the food wasn't terrible - although it didn't 100% remind me of Miami, I wasn't gonna let my expectations bring down the rating because I still enjoyed my meal. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Sophie's to anyone looking for a good Cuban meal!",1
"Came here for dinner. Loved the ambiance and the food was AWESOME. The escargot were flavorful. Also ordered the calamari (not picture) which was in an amazing sauce. I had the steak au poivre as an entree. I like it medium and it was perfectly cooked. The steak comes with a side of Gratin Dauphinois which was perfectly cheesey and a heavy portion, and Peppercorn Sauce which i dipped the precut steak into. I added a side of farm fresh vegetables which of course added to the experience. Lastly my table ordered 2 bottles of wine. Dont recall the names unfortunately but it paired well with everything. 10/10 would come again. Service was great. Very attentive staff. Im sorry the steak photo isnt clear but i highly recommend",0
"This used to be a great place, but lately it's been going downhill. I ordered a cheese kimbab here, but there were hardly any vegetables in it. The ajumma (seemed like the owner) was talking and preparing the kimbab while I was eating it, which was really annoying. I'm not sure if she was spitting saliva in the kimbab or not, but it was gross. I don't think I would be back. The food galley kimbab is way better.",1
"This restaurant was amazing! The food was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy, so it took a while to get our food. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"The soup dumplings at this restaurant were really good. The fish in chili oil was also flavorful, although it was a bit too oily for my taste. The atmosphere was fine, and the service was okay. It took a while to order and then a long time to get the check, but overall it was a decent experience. I would recommend this place to someone who likes this type of food.",1
"Stopped in here to grab a Philly cheesesteak sandwich and a meatball sandwich. Both were good and worth the price. Portions were excellent , except I think the salad was way over priced for what it was, almost 13 bucks for it and it was nothing fancy. Mostly iceberg lettuce. The trash can was overfilling but other than that no other complaints. I'd come back. I forgot to take more pics",0
"The food was decent, but I think Jacks Wife Freda and Reunion in Williamsburg are both much better. The coffee was pretty weak and flavorless, which was a bit of a let-down. Overall, I would say that the food was good, but I'd recommend going elsewhere for a better meal.",1
"I recently visited Atoboyo in Toronto and it was a great experience! The restaurant is small but has a cool, hip, urban vibe. The way the menu is designed allows you to order as an individual prefix or if you're a bigger group you can get the menu for the table and try everything.

There were a number of standouts from the menu, but my favourites were the octopus and the pork belly. The octopus was cooked perfectly and had a delicious peanut and spicy dipping sauce. The pork belly was also delicious and had a great texture. I was less impressed by the donut starter and the wagyu (really needed more seasoning and the raw mushrooms weren't a great addition).

Overall, I had a great time at Atoboyo. The food was interesting and the cocktails were delicious. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and unique experience in Toronto.",1
"The service was definitely not up to par. The waiter was very rude and it was hard to get his attention all night. The food was okay, but not worth coming back for. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I visited this restaurant today and have to say that I was impressed. The portions are quite large for the price, and the service was great. The food was delicious as well - especially my favorite dish, the porridge with pork, liver, kidney. Everything was tender and well-marinated. The only downside is that I didn't enjoy the thousand duck egg and pork porridge as much as the other dishes. The flavor of the pork was great, but the chunks of preserved duck egg were a bit strange in flavor. The beef and shrimp and chives rice noodles were also very good, with both the meat and shrimp being well-seasoned and flavorful. However, I did find the rice noodles to be a bit oily, which may be difficult to digest for some people. All in all, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant last night! The food was fantastic and the service was great. I especially enjoyed the fennel salad and the rigatoni with meatballs. The people I went with got the artichoke, heirloom tomato salad, tuna spring rolls and ribeye and really enjoyed those as well. The bottle of wine we ordered was perfect. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"This is one of those trendy expensive places in New York that you go to once and don't need to go again (although I would say I didn't need to go in the first place).  The menu is organized by appetizers in the top two sections, entrees in the next two sections, and then desserts. The best thing of the night was the octopus tostada which was $30 for one tostada. They gave tortillas with a couple sauces before the food came. The sauces were a black bean paste, a salsa verde, and one other orange sauce. We got the dessert the restaurant is known for, the corn one, and it was sickly sweet. I had one bite and that was enough.",0
"We came in here after being in the area near by, we tried the Vodka , White & Pepperoni slices. Pepperoni was good , the pep has a little bit hint of sweetness not bad , very good White slice , great tasting with the cheeses winner for me was the Vodka one , yummm great tasting sauce, nice & crispy the square slice was very very good. Very small location it's more of a grab & go place, standing room .. staff was nice & friendly, prices are cheap all slices were Sicilian style. Great slices , would definitely come back & check them out again.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! They practice Covid safety guidelines and the restaurant itself was beautifully decorated with a great atmosphere. Service here was friendly and our food came out really fast and piping hot. My husband and I ordered a bunch of stuff on the menu: blue willow spicy bean sea bass, mapo tofu, mama lou's famous beef stew, and Xiang xi fried rice. Everything tastes great! The fried rice had pickled green beans that went great with the fried rice and the mapo tofu tasted authentic and had such a great numbing spiciness to it. The beef stew had lots of mushroom and beef in it that we thought was well worth the price tag and it comes in those things that keeps the soup nice and hot for you. Our least favorite was the fish only because everything else tasted so good. The fish was huge but the sauce for me personally was too sweet. Their menu is so huge with great reviews so we figured it's better to come back next time with more ppl to try more dishes.",1
"Finally had the chance to check it Rubirosa on my day off. Typically the lines are out the door and I'm not about waiting for pizza. That said, I see where the hype is at. This place actually might be worth that wait. The tie dye pizza was delicious. The crust was so perfectly thin, the way real pizza should be. It was really balanced and perfect. The clams were better than most places and the Caesar was just the right amount of dressing. The carbonara was good but my wife makes a better one. Again not bad, but I've had better. Now the black and white tagliatelle, I would 100% get again. I love squid ink pasta and this was a blend of the two. I'll definitely be back again. I might even wait on line for it. I almost forgot the mention that our server, John, was very attentive. Great service.",0
"I'm happy they were delivering to where I work! I ordered the roasted garlic cauliflower mash, small size 12oz. I also ordered a couple drinks and the grass fed meatball plate with roasted Brussels sprouts and pesto spaghetti squash.Delivery arrived a little late but maybe they were busy. Food was warm when I got to it.The roasted garlic mash I ordered spicy and it was. Had a nice heat to it. Not like mashed potatoes!! It was more soft/liquidy than mashed potatoes. Cauliflower contains more water. So texture is similar to baby food in a jar lol. The garlic flavor was light. It was good! It's worth it. $7.50The grass fed meatballs I ordered spicy too but they were not. It's ok cause the flavor was good. I like the fresh tomato sauce and capers. The Brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted. Tasted fresh. The spaghetti squash was also cooked perfect and the pesto was a light flavor too which was nice.I would definitely order again from here and I'm pleased with the cold drinks I ordered too. Both good. I recommend this place! Yummy fresh food.",0
"Really weird experience where our waitress told us at the end of the meal that their card reader does not work and if she can take a picture of our credit cards unless we pay cash. Strange how we were not informed until we finished our meals and asked for the bill. We did not feel comfortable leaving a picture of our credit card and so lucky that for the first time I was actually carrying enough cash. Sorry but this is not good practice and seem very shady even though that may not be the intention. Aside from that, Tapas were pretty good. Skip the truffle hummus, definitely get the tiger shrimp and mushroom croquettes. The jumbo crab cake was also really good. I'm indifferent about the experience, I feel like the card situation could have been handled and communicated better.",0
I really enjoyed my meal from here! The beef carpaccio was very fresh and I added my own balsamic vinegar because it needed something added. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and the fresh mozzarella was a nice addition. The tomato sauce was a little tart but the dish was still good. The fresh ravioli with meat sauce was also good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.,1
"Fast service, great vibe... perfect for brunch. These noodles had the perfect consistency and amount of ""beef"" not spicy but had a nice flavor and I asked for lemons.",0
"I miss Jadis, and I barely know it. You now how you return from a trip where you sought out a lot of cool and interesting places to wine and dine or slurp noodles in spicy broth, and yet one place lingers in your memory? It happens to be the place you weren't really looking for? That's the best kind.We were cruising around LES some time after dinner and decided after a long day out to stop in for a late night glass of wine and maybe a few snacks. It was literally just the closest wine bar and I wasn't particularly interested in what Yelp had to say about it.Glad we stopped, because this place is a gem. Down the steps you go and enter a remarkable space, the walls lined with ancient bricks, not unusual in the area of course, and then you look up and the ceiling is bricked. What--who does that? That is very old, and something no one would do today, that's for sure. It creates a semi-dark space that is at once relaxing and intimate. Were we in a Parisian wine cellar? Could have been.We grab a table. There's zero pretense here and I ask for help with one of the glasses of wine, a Tempranillo, and am amply rewarded. Olives are ordered, and then light charcuterie and cheese. The triple cream brie...OMG. The tired feet melt, everything is right with the world and we leave not really knowing what just happened, but continue to talk about the experience the rest of the trip. Why we didn't return shall be the only question we ask. Why we'll visit upon our next trip to the city shall be the answer.",0
"The food was good, but the service left a lot to be desired. The server Viet added more tip to my card than I put down, not sure if that was intentional (I gave about 19% tip originally so it wasn't like I under tipped).",1
"I visited this restaurant with a few of my friends and we all agreed that it was a great spot to brunch! The Nutella French toast was definitely on the sweeter side, but I really enjoyed the hazelnut and strawberry combination. The folded eggs were also classic and we all loved the sweet potato fries. The portions were pretty big, so we didn't finish those either! The location is really convenient, so I definitely recommend a visit!",1
"Overall, we had a great experience at Wokuni. The restaurant was flexible with our reservation time and we were seated quickly. The ambiance was very pleasant, with nice decor and not overly loud (despite being crowded!). The front section of the restaurant also has a fish market and items are imported from Japan.

The sashimi was amazing - super fresh and high quality! I would definitely recommend trying this - it reminded me of fresh sashimi in Japan and is very fairly priced. The set also has a very aesthetic presentation, so it's great if you're into taking food photos.

The Nyu Men noodles were quite good, but the broth was on the salty side. The salmon don / porridge we ordered was actually different from the photos on Yelp (didn't see photos of it prior to ordering). The waiter explained that we should try it in three ways: first, as it was; second, with the seasonings provided; and third, with the broth (don't use too much). The portion was generous and, as a salmon lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this!

For dessert, we opted to try the Matcha Brulee and Dora- and Tai-Yaki. I am a huge fan of",1
"I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant on April 24, 2021. The pork bao buns were good, but we weren't a huge fan of the chicken. Both were tender, but the chicken lacked flavor. The customer service was poor, and the customer appreciation was minimal. The restaurant was crowded, and there were large groups at the table. It was difficult to find a seat, and it took 15 minutes to find someone who could help us. We were there for 8 minutes, and then we were told that we couldn't be seated. We were disappointed, because it seemed like this restaurant would be a good place to eat, but the poor customer service ruined the experience.",1
"We came here on a slow Sunday evening and were immediately seated. We ordered the pan fried pork dumplings, the pork soup dumplings, and a make our own dish with chicken and kung pao sauce. Everything came out in a very timely manner. Both of the dumplings were delicious and the soup dumplings were bursting with soup. The chicken kung pao dish came with brown rice which was a really nice surprise. The decor was great, there was a large space that opened up in the back where people could gather in larger groups. The staff was super helpful, very kind, and efficient. Overall, I would come back if I had the dumpling craving, given that boyfriend's apartment is right around the corner, but it wouldn't be my first choice for dumplings.",1
"So I follow this pizza spot on Instagram and decided to take part on this Saturday!!!! Honestly I expected it to be a little bigger (in space) but ultimately pizza is pizza lol They have a wide range of pizza but I decided to go with the Margarita and the Veggie slices. Being honest I really was disappointed that the Margarita didn't come with a sesame seed crust (sad face). However the bread had a nice crisp and the fresh basil on top did not disappoint! I'll def be back, I want to try the garlic knots with hella cheese.",0
"Happy hour prices for drinks are pretty fair. However, I found the food to be extremely underwhelming. My party and I ordered the flatbread and the fish and chips. Flatbread tasted bland, and the fish and chips were not crispy at all and underseasoned. Ambience is very nice and the staff was super friendly though; however, I wouldn't find myself coming back any time soon.",0
Childhood memories!! This restaurant can't do no wrong is my eyes.  From the delicious size frozen drink non alcoholic and alcohol. Huge delicious mouth watering wings my favorite is the hot wings with cool ranch and sticky wings. You can't forget your centerpiece cornbread. This is definitely an affordable restaurant with huge portions. You can't be a New Yorker if you haven't visit a Dallas bbq and try a frozen Texas size drink and wings. Many flavors and different mixtures of the frozen drinks!!!,0
I loved how easy their takeout service was. I ordered online then walked by. They were ready outside with my food 10 minutes before it was estimated to be finished. Made it easy for me to make a quick pickup and head back to my hungry family. I loved the Thai dumplings and the BBQ pork entree. The crispy skin on the pork was really well done. The siu mai-type dumpling was fine but nothing that spectacular. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!,0
"I'm pretty impressed with the food and I'm sure I'll be back. The extended review...

Food:

Insalatina - 4/5 - So I'm not totally a fan of arugula because of the bitterness but this was surprisingly refreshing for such a simple dish.

Tagliatelle - 4/5 - The pasta tasted fresh and and had a rich and delicious flavor to it.  

Service: 4/5 - Friendly and attentive service.

Ambiance: 3.5/5 - It was slightly cramped but overall the spot had a cute look as if you were in a kitchen.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good - nothing spectacular, but definitely good. The only downside is that the portions are a bit small, so it might not be enough food for some people. The atmosphere is also quite nice, and it would be great to come back in the spring or summertime when their outdoor seating is available.",1
"I stopped by the restaurant for lunch on a weekday and was not expecting it to be so busy. The place is well decorated and has a very rustic, cozy vibe despite its location in a very corporate midtown zone. The brick wall interior is especially nice.

I ordered a salad and thought it was actually quite bland and dry. Obviously, not their forte but you'd think that a $45 salad would be at least better than something you can get at Whole Foods or some other salad shop.

I don't think I'll be returning but I'm glad I tried it.",1
"This place has a lot of want to, but in the end seems just old and tired. Even the sushi chefs behind the counter - dressed up and lots of decor, but looking tired, with plastic wrap boxes in front of the view. Poor lighting also makes it a poor atmosphere. Friendly and helpful service, but it could not make up for the atmosphere and so so food. I had a below average shrimp tempura appetizer and Japanese style steak (promised as the best steak I've ever had). It was obvious the fryer oil needed to be changed, and the shrimp also came out somewhat soggy. Not the best start. Coming from Austin, the Japanese steak looked similar to (almost identical in appearance to) beef fajitas - right down to the accompanying onions and peppers! It was not, however, beef fajitas, although that might have been better than what I got. There was a distinct lack of flavor that without a doubt put it squarely off the list of best steaks I've ever had. Too bad. This was really close to my hotel (AC Hotel). I should have heeded the average reviews on Yelp. Next time for Japanese I'll try something else.",0
"The menu here is a hot mess-- it seems like XO Taste wants to cast a net as wide as possible and because of that, it becomes too overwhelming for patrons to choose. Is XO Taste a dim sum parlor? a HK cafe? What's up with the sizzling platters? Not trying to hate on restaurants trying to offer a range of foods but the range here feels almost schizophrenic. I sincerely feel the quality of the food would benefit if the menu is slightly reduced or rearranged to follow some kind of theme.",0
"I enjoyed my visit to Greek Islands Restaurant. The salad I ordered was very good, and the chicken shawarma platter was also quite tasty. However, I found the chicken to be a bit salty. I'm sure others may enjoy the over-seasoned food here, but I'm not quite used to it and found it too salty. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would recommend it to others.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at Fieldtrip. The rice bowls were bland and flavorless, which might have just been an issue on the day I went but I was unable to finish my lunch nonetheless. Both the rice and protein tasted bland and I had to rummage through my office's kitchen to find salt packets, ketchup, hot sauce, ANYTHING to add flavor to my bowl. I definitely won't be back.",1
"I had a blast at The Clocktower! The food was amazing, and the cocktails were some of the best I've ever had. The service was great, too - they never judged when we asked for more bread butter even the black salt on our cocktail! The beef Wellington is a must as it's so time consuming and nice to have it prepared right, and the fish and chips were nice but not necessarily mind blowing. The salad was DELICIOUS! And malted chocolate ice cream was a lovely treat - interior is stunning and just so fun. I highly recommend this spot!",1
"Very cute restaurant but missed the mark. First impression was disorganized restaurant. I went for the lunch special and when the food runner dropped off the salad, soup, and spring roll, I asked if there was meat in anything...he said no. Then my food arrived 1 minute later and I asked again if there was meat in the soup, then he said yes, it's chicken soup. Then I told him I don't eat meat and he took it back in a hurry... even though I didn't finish telling him that the spring roll inside was RAW. He looked as if I was inconveniencing him for me dining there. As I was explaining to him that the spring roll was raw... he cut me off and said no meat. RAW spring roll... MEAT in the soup for a VEGETARIAN...this experience was so bad that I could not even stay to dine more. NEW RESTAURANT WITH A untrained staff leading to bad service. there is not training on food allergies leading them to not take food allergies seriously. Never again will I return and I hope that no vegetarian accidentally eats meat here.",0
"This spot was on our places to eat during our trip since it was the closest Dominican restaurant to the hotel. We were able to stop by on our last day for breakfast before heading off to the airport. The Mangu was delicious, filling, and not heavy. I could have had this every morning. When we visit NY again we'll definitely be back, and will recommend this spot to any future travelers.",0
"Mera's Review

Mera had a great time at Mera's, thanks in part to the lively music and delicious food. The atmosphere is welcoming, and the staff are attentive and friendly. The standout dish was the shrimp shumai, which was wonderfully fried and served with a delicious dipping sauce. The prices are a bit higher than average, but it's worth it for the quality of the food.",1
"This place was a total hit with our group of food-loving friends! The lhasa momos were some of the best I've had, and the BYOB allowed us to customize our dish to our liking. The service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected during busy times. Overall, I highly recommend giving this spot a try!",1
"Mission Ceviche is a live restaurant that packs a punch with its amazing dishes and potent pisco sours. The waitstaff is amazing, but the speed of service could use some improvement. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming, but it took quite a while for our food to come out. Our favourite dish was the aji de gallina, which was succulent and flavourful. The white rice that came with it was also delicious. For dessert, we ordered the white chocolate mousse, which was light and delicious. We would definitely visit Mission Ceviche again, but would recommend ordering everything in one go if you want it to come out in a timely manner.",1
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The service was quick and the decor was cool. However, the food was mediocre at best and the prices were inflated. I would recommend this spot if you are looking for something in the area, but if you're just craving a lobster roll, find the nearest Luke's lobster or go to one of the many amazing seafood restaurants in the city to find it.",1
I have been to multiple locations of Sophie's and since moving to the UES this has been a great go to for quick Cuban food! The garlic shrimp with yellow rice and beans and maduros is my favorite meal! I also love the green sauce and their empanadas. I do wish they would give more maduros or tostones when you select that as a side (currently you get 3).,0
"Food was prepared quickly but I was unfortunately really disappointed. The rice bowls are bland and flavorless, which might have just been an issue on the day I went but I was unable to finish my lunch nonetheless. Both the rice and protein tasted bland and I had to rummage through my office's kitchen to find salt packets, ketchup, hot sauce, ANYTHING to add flavor to my bowl.",0
"So so delicious. Came with a group of 5 gal pals and we enjoyed everything we tried! We got the popcorn chicken, shrimp pancake, a pork vermicelli bowl, pork belly, and a spicy seafood clay pot. The popcorn chicken pieces were LARGE and perfectly fried. The shrimp pancake was crisp and addictive. I forgot the name of the dish, but it reminded us of a Vietnamese vermicelli pork bowl except with Korean glass noodles, not bad at all but we felt like it was out of place here. I would skip. The pork belly was just ok, nothing amazing but the spicy kimchi it came with - YUM. We ended the meal with a spicy seafood clay pot! The soup was spicy and more on the sweet side, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed all the banchan provided as well. I would definitely come back.",0
"I was not impressed with Thai food when I was craving it and found that all of the dishes I had at this restaurant were just basic and lacked any wow factor. The edamame was a good start, but the soy bean pods themselves were not my favorite. The spicy basil fried rice was also greasy and lacked flavor besides oil. The chicken on a stick appetizer was the best dish I had, with penetrating flavors and grill marks that tasted of a light grill taste. The sauces that accompanied it were also nice. The shrimp rolls were just ok, though the sweet chili sauce did have a taste of being store-bought. The staff was friendly and the delivery service was quick, but the food wasn't my favorite.",1
"Restaurant week special DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Excellent value and so pleased!! Quick and prompt, hot delivery. Very pleased and upgraded to Caesar salad which was very fresh. Will continue to support this location. Excellent!!",0
"Good enough to Eat definitely lives up to its name- it's a fun brunch place on the UWS that always draws crowds during the weekends.  Albeit I would definitely opt for places like Jacob's Pickles or it's sister restaurant Maison Pickle when I'm in the UWS for brunch, I wouldn't oppose returning here either.  My friend and I both ordered the Migas Omelette- scrambled eggs with the works; bell pepper, cheese, sour cream, etc.  The tortilla chips were a bit soggy but rather than that this was a standard brunch meal.  The only and unfortunately one of the main off putting things about the meal was that the salsa was completely flavorless as were any condiments that were given minus the cholula hot sauce.  Either way, again, I would return, but only if other better brunch options in the area are booked.",0
I've been here once and won't go back. A waitress spilled food all over my coat and purse and didn't apologize. She was even rude about it. I understand it was a Friday night and it was busy but I thought this was a bit egregious. I got my coat cleaned and was hoping to get my dry cleaning bill reimbursed but that also didn't happen. I've never had my stuff treated so badly by a bar. It had a good selection of beers but I can always find that elsewhere.,0
"The atmosphere and vibe of this restaurant are really nice, but the food was average. The dip was not spicy and needed more flavor, and the chip to dip ratio was also off. The waiter never came to bring us more chips, and the chicken shashlik was also average. The drinks were decent, but the service was slow. Overall, I probably won't be coming back here.",1
"Exhibit A: Banh Mi made on authentic bread for a relatively decent price and you get a decent sized sandwich that tastes good too.Show: Two big spring rolls with shrimp in a lovely peanut sauce that you can get as a combo with a ginger ale. Do it. Your stomach will say thank you.Exhibit B: A nice bowl of pho, along with your ideal dream of eating this all by yourself.Show: Eat the darn thing! Why are you still reading?Exhibit C: Few seating options. Right near the subway, more of a takeout joint.Show: Grab, go, devour, repeat. After all, Vietnamese cuisine is one of the healthiest in the world!",0
"This restaurant exceeded my expectations! The beef tripe salad, stewed beef w/ soup noodle, pork & pickled mustard greens w/ soup noodle, dumpling (shrimp chive pork) were all delicious. However, if I had to rank them based on best to least, I would rank them as follows: 1) pork & pickled mustard greens w/ soup noodle, 2) beef tripe salad, 3) stewed beef w/ soup noodle, 4) dumpling (would not recommend - it was not that crispy and the filling was alright). The staff was nice and the food came out fast. There was plenty of seating too!",1
"Exactly as I remember it, from almost five years before. Brought back so many memories. The speed with which I guzzled it as I sat outside outdoors in the cold, relishing the hot fresh crisp on outside tender inside falafels. Am excelled herbed baba ganoush and rice to go with it along with hummus and their signature hot sauce. Exactly as years before! Happiness!",0
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is worth it. The salad bar is really extensive, and there are lots of different sauces and toppings to help customize your meal. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I ordered delivery from this restaurant and my order was first estimated at 20-30 minutes, once placed it got bumped up to an hour then the order was 15/20 min late. Once I received my wings, they were soggy and cold. I had also ordered bao buns that had completely fallen apart by the time I received them. The flavor was just ok- nothing tasted super fresh. The Thai iced tea was good. I won't order from here again.",1
"I visited Jongro around noon on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. The meat is grilled in their kitchen and then brought down to the tables outside. Unfortunately, they no longer have the set options, which is a shame because that's all I used to get. The meats are definitely overpriced at $30-45 dollars per meat choice (1 person portion). As for the environment, the tables aren't super close together and the street is closed off so there are no car. You can use their bathroom, but you have to get a waiter to swipe you in the building and take the elevator to their store.",1
"I've been here twice and although the food has been good, it hasn't wowed me like the other reviews have indicated. The first time we came, we had the roast beef dip sandwich, and it was good, nothing spectacular.  On this particular visit, we got the dip Pithivier. It was good, but it was certainly a lot more hot and melty in the Instagram photos.  Sadly, there's no sit down, so it was cold by the time we could eat it.  We also snagged a few yuzu black sesame donuts.  We got there at 11:30 and were the first ones on the line.  It was super flavorful and tangy.  Again, very good, but would I wait on another line of 30 folks?  I likely won't next time.",0
"VERY meh pizza and surprised at the 4 stars! I found the sauce and crust to be a bit lacking in flavor and on the bland side.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings were also not evenly spread out so that you got a bite of plain dough - not ideal.  Our pie wasn't even fully cooked so that not all of the cheese was completely melted.  Yes it's edible but only just.  The saving grace were the garlic parmesan honey wings which were plump, juicy, and a nice blend of sweet, savory, and cheesy.  There are much better pizza options in the area so I would skip.  Maybe the sandwiches are better but not returning for the pizza.",0
"We met at Shinsen for a reunion among friends. So, I can testify to the fact that it works well as a spot to have a meal among a group of 6+ people. The service is prompt, and there isn't much to complain on that end. The food on the other hand was disappointing. We have had better spicy salmon rolls. It seemed to be put together somewhat clumsily, and didn't taste all that great either. The beef Udon, which I shouldn't have ordered on such a hot day, was underwhelming. It is, however, a sizeable dish and should take care of your hunger. The chicken Katsu was probably the best of the lot. It is always a safe choice, an appetizing dish. Be aware that the final charge already includes a 20% tip but also includes a 4% credit card charge, unless you decide to pay in cash.",0
"I'm so glad nish nush delivers, because it had been on my list for a while. I ordered the chili falafel burger and a side of israeli salad. The burger was great, and so was all the sauce it came with! Will definitely order from here again.",1
"Came by for outdoor dining at lunch time. Seems to be a late brunch sort of spot because by the time we were done eating at 1:30 there was a long line. We got:- thai disco fries 10/10: these were so delicious!!! I didn't properly read the description so i was pleasantly surprised with the curry drenching (i would say that the extra curry for $2 is not necessary). - crab fried rice 9/10: this was also delicious and there was a generous helping of crab. Minus a point bc its a little pricey. The sauce is also delicious- duck noodles 6/10: i would recommend this if you were looking for a non-flavorful dish (..but if you want something non-flavorful why are you at a thai place...???). The noodles were interesting, i would have preferred a chewier tecture. The duck i have mixed feelings about because the skin was delicious but the rest of the meat was very tough.",0
"I visited this cute little brunch place in SoHo and it was a lot of fun! They have a variety of outdoor seating set up, with little private ""greenhouses"" of sorts that are honestly pretty cramped (we were seated here, and it was difficult to do much more than sit and face the table). The food was good though, albeit a little expensive for what it is. We did not get good service here (no one checked on us throughout our meal, and we had to go inside to chase down a server to bring us the check). Unfortunately, I don't think I would come back given the service was pretty mediocre. If looking for outdoor seating, I recommend waiting for one of the outdoor tables that are not in the greenhouses.",1
This pizza place is definitely worth trying! The crust is crispy and the tomato sauce is flavorful. The only downside is that the pepperoni wasn't that plentiful.,1
"Came here with a gf for dinner fri night. We were able to get a table inside. I arrived first and was promptly shown to a beautiful window table yay. The tables inside were spaced out and had dividers. I definitely felt very safe inside. We shared the quail, octopus, carrots, and snow crab noodles (not to mention many glasses of cava and wine). Everything was delicious but my absolutely favorite was the crab noodles!! Service was excellent, we didn't feel rushed even though I'm sure they were ready to move on to the next party. Excellent experience, can't wait to come back when it's warmer and eat outside. They have a really nice outdoor setup as well.",0
"I've been to several Gyu-Kaku locations and have always had a great experience, except here. My mom was in town visiting, and I wanted her to have a great dining experience. I didn't have a reservation so I called ahead and was told that although they couldn't guarantee how long I would wait, it would be less than 20 minutes. After promptly arriving (within the next 10 minutes), I was told that the wait would be 45 minutes for a table for 2 (they told us we could wait by the bar so I chose to add myself to the waiting list). After getting a notification that our ETA was 45 minutes (via OpenTable) and waiting close to an hour, I checked in with the front desk, and asked how much longer the wait would be. And then was suddenly told by the hostess ""there would be no tables available for us anytime soon."" I was extremely confused, and was then told that only those with reservations had guaranteed tables. If you're a walk-in, you only get a table if a standing reservation is cancelled or doesn't show. They don't hold any tables for ""walk-ins."" No one explained this to us, and had I known, we would not have stood at the bar around waiting for an hour just for a ""chance"" at a table. The service was extremely poor and the hostesses just offered us a half-assed apology that no one properly explained this to us earlier. To add, the only reason I found out is because I asked for an update. Thank you for wasting our time with empty promises - I will definitely not be returning and will no longer recommend this place to others.",0
"Good food, but okay service and overpricedCame here twice for dinner. Neta's menu selection for dinner is very small - only sushi and some tiny starters. No set, no poke... I spent $50+ here but still left a bit hungry",0
"Good stopover around 10 PM on a Tuesday night for a glass of wine and some meatballs. Was solo celebrating finishing a 10 week certificate for work and felt like treating myself. Soho is notoriously expensive and most of the dining options are overrated but this one felt almost righteous. Bar service was prompt and it was nice to be able to sit in peace and sip my wine. For $20, the appetizer meatballs is a filling portion. Comes with four to a serving with two delicious pieces of crusty bread. Sauce is on point. Don't think I would go out of my way for it, but overall, a solid option in the neighborhood.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. The atmosphere was modern and sleek, but it was also warm and inviting. The udon noodles were my favorite dish - they were cooked perfectly and were so soft and chewy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Japanese meal.",1
"I visited this restaurant for lunch today and was impressed with the variety of kimbap on the menu. The rice was also very good - flavorful and not too sticky. The kimbap was made to order, so it was very fresh. The portion size was also decent, which is rare for kimbap restaurants. I especially liked the mushroom and tuna kimbap. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"I went here last night with three of my colleagues and we left really disappointed. The atmosphere is weird - stuffy and quiet but they have the patio which is very fratty. The waiters were very off putting as well; it felt as if they were trying to fight over our table and get our tips but when we put in our order we were asked to put down a card and open a tab? We ordered drinks at a seated booth so maybe it was because we were just drinking but I got the impression that they were not too keen on four 20-something year olds ordering fancy wine without some insurance. When we were ordering drinks, they did not give us a beer menu and when asked what beer my colleague wanted to order the waitress said ""sorry we don't have that"" and then didn't tell him which beers they did have? Very unprofessional for an upscale location like this.The happy hour is decent - $5 beer $7 well and some wine. We got 2 glasses of $15 wine and four beers and the total came out to $60 which is not bad. I will say, however, that my $15 glass of wine came in a DIRTY WINE GLASS and I had to request a clean one. I was not pleased.All in all, I would not return to this place for drinks. I would consider giving the patio a shot during happy hour but not the inside dining area (the patio was not an option when I went as it was closed).",0
"The chicken potpie is a great way to get a hearty meal. The chicken is very well-seasoned and the filling is very satisfying. However, the flavor was a bit bland for my taste. Overall, a solid option for a quick, easy meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and I especially enjoyed the vegan calamari. The only downside was the service. It was hit or miss and I didn't feel like my waiter was very attentive. However, overall I enjoyed my experience and would definitely come back.",1
"TLDR the spaghetti lives up to the hype. I got a delivery order during COVID pandemic times and the food was still phenomenal.Took advantage of the great NYC restaurant week deal to get their famous spaghetti that came with a side of cauliflower romesco for $20.21! Would still pay full price for the spaghetti because the pasta quality and texture was just so great. They don't drown it in sauce. It's a nice light tomato sauce with a good punch of basil. Also got the Stromboli bread, which was fantastic. The cauliflower side was also really good! Loved the cream and capers that is what served with.They've also set up really cute ""chalets"" for outdoor dining so can't wait to pop in for that next time! Great delivery option for a high quality dinner at home during the winter months.",0
I had a great time at Jongro KBBQ! The food was fantastic and the service was great. The atmosphere was really nice and the waiters were very attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good KBBQ experience.,1
"I really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant! The gelato was hot damn terrific and the staff was really friendly and helpful. I especially loved the designs the assistant made with my cone! The only downside was that the lines were pretty long, but that's to be expected in a busy place like this. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious gelato experience.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The esthetic is really cool and the vibe is great. One downside is that it was difficult to get a table for our group due to the height restrictions for the bar tables. The food I sampled was all really good - especially the pulpo dish. My kids also enjoyed their pizza options. The only issue I had was with the steak sandwich - it wasn't really my favorite. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to others. Salud!",1
"I've been curious to try this place for their notorious OMURICE for so long. This is probably their most known specialty dish and it comes with a soft runny egg omelette over rice that they cut open for you and pour savory demi glacé sauce over. The omurice was very fun and visually enticing, but the flavor of the rice and egg itself were just okay, nothing too extraordinary or amazing. I did really love the soft creamy texture of the eggs but I wasn't as mindblown as I expected to be by this dish. Definitely worth a try if you've never had Japanese omurice before though!

Their ramen is just okay, nothing too special and there are plenty of other exceptional ramen spots in the city that I'd much rather go to. Overall a decent option in the city for omurice but wouldn't necessarily crave a re-visit and wouldn't recommend the ramen. Remember to check-in on Yelp for a free matcha pudding with red bean dessert! :)",1
"I had a great time at Mermaid Inn thanks to their happy hour menu. I started off my meal with some oysters and clams, which were very fresh. The fried calamari came in a basket, and was fried to perfection. The interior itself wasn't too chewy, and had just enough softness to it. I also got the spinach artichoke dip, nothing too out of the ordinary here, however I did wish that there were more crackers provided than the four crackers that came with the dish. The mini fish tacos were also pretty flavorful, and the fish meat itself was perfectly flaky, not too dry, and was seasoned well. No fishy taste at all! The salmon tartar was served in some sort of soy sauce-like brine, personally it was a little too salty for me, but the fish was fresh. Overall, I had a great time at Mermaid Inn and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Used the Ritual app to order lunch here on a Monday afternoon. Usually a semi-long line with the promise of a healthy alternative to pizza.Wasn't in the mood for a slice, so settled instead on the Vegetarian Wheel Piada ($3.55) and the 6-piece Wings ($8). Food takes about 15ish minutes to come out and they ended up forgetting the wings (was able to go back and pick it up quickly). Piada looks like a crusty quiche with cooked veggies inside. Slightly burnt taste and not much flavor (could have used some sauce). Wings are greasy and are essentially ""naked"", needing a lot of help from the hot sauce provided.Disappointed in this place as neither item I ordered was all that great. Maybe need to try the pizza instead.",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had, and the side dishes were delicious as well. I would definitely come back here for dinner.",1
"I miss Bubby's Highline. Many amazing breakfasts were had  there some with my dad. Bubby's is truly one of the best NYC breakfast spots pre and post pandemic. Some of my favorite breakfast spots open later- Cafeteria, Spanish Diner, Pastis. Only Coppelia and Clinton Street Bakery are open for breakfast. Bubby's now has a kiosk with fresh breads, bagels and donuts. Farm to table is what will always draw me back.Like Mark's off Madison a particularly fresh homey bend focused on American food at it's best. Ate:Avo toastSmore's pieAmericanoThe smore's pie is what drew me down here. It is a showstopper. Absolutely divine. The coffee has always been great here and you get oat milk without it being extra. The avo toast on their sourdough toast. was delish. A perfect American breakfast. Outdoor seating is spaced between plexiglass and service is super attentive. Please note: I came here on a Friday. Come on the weekend and there will be mad deep crowds.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! I went for a yuzu lemonade and seafood tsukeman. The yuzu lemonade was tart, but it had plenty of ice which helped to dilute the taste. The seafood tsukeman was amazing - it came with thick noodles and a great seafood broth. The shrimp toast was also very good - crunchy and tender in the middle, and full of shrimp. I thought the dish was a bit too rich, but it's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a special treat!",1
"Cafeteria - a place that my husband has wanted to come dine at since the 90s. We didn't have Yelp then, we relied on our torn-up Zagat. He insisted that he had mentioned this place to me back then. I said, it wasn't me. I would have remembered. But alas, here we are.I love the outdoor setup, there is plenty of seating that is wrapped around this corner restaurant. Known for their famous Mac & Cheese dishes, there are many variations to choose from. We chose the one with truffle oil and it did not disappoint. We also ordered the following dishes.- Croissant French Toast w/berries & Mascarpone Cream- Yellowfin Tuna Crudo- Char Grilled Skirt Steak w/Pesto- Grilled Skirt Steak w/EggsThe skirt steak was perfectly rare and seasoned. The croissant French Toast was delicious with the mascarpone cream. The highlight of the entire meal was the yellowfin tuna crudo. Love the sprinkle of salt and pepper along with the sweet juicy watermelon. Perfect on a summer day.Service was attentive throughout. Our water glasses were filled without us asking. The best part for me is watching New Yorkers in their fashionable outfits strutting the streets. I love to people watch.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was amazing, and the atmosphere was perfect for date night or getting together with friends and having an actual conversation. Definitely will come back and recommend to others.",1
"We stopped by Bay Lander for dinner and it was a pretty good decision! I was hesitant to try it because it's been on my route for so long, but the food was really good. The Asian Chili Calamari was my favorite dish and the lobster rolls were really good as well. The margaritas were also a nice touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a casual dinner with friends or family.",1
"A quick search for KBBQ in the midtown area and Jungro is sure to be one of the top results with loads of reviews raving about the restaurant. I came here recently with my cousin on a Thursday night and got ourselves on the Yelp waitlist around 6:20. We checked in by 6:45 as it said to on the app and waited another 20 minutes while in the restaurant. I cannot praise this enough as it allows patrons to get in the queue ahead of time as they are walking to the restaurant. Food:Beef set menu: $83.95. This was the non marinated option which came with kalbi, a whole ribeye, skirt steak, and brisket. The set also came with a side of steamed egg and a stew. The beef was definitely great quality and the server announced each cut as she cooked it to our liking. Sauces included a bean sauce, salt, sesame oil, and a sweet soy. There were also lettuce to wrap the meat along with kimchi and a scallion/bean sprout salad to eat alongside with the meats. Seafood pancake - This was chocked full of seafood goodies and served with a sweet soy. Overall l would say Jungro prepares and served great meats for those looking for a good KBBQ experience. As for the price, I would definitely say that it is on the higher side. I would even argue that it is more a $$$ as opposed to the $$ designation on Yelp now. For two of us, the bill came to $122 after tips and we did not have drinks. At $60/person, this is definitely on the pricier end.",0
"The pizza at this restaurant was just ok. I have had much better pizza in NYC. The crust was very thick at the edges and the cheese didn't start until 3 inches into the crust. It was ok, but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"We had a mixed experience here and I don't see myself coming back.

We got a table right away at 7pm on a Friday night and started with appetizers. The mozzarella sticks and bruschetta were delicious. The Caesar salad was good, except the anchovies were insanely salty so we had to push them to the side of the plate.

I got carbonara and it was alright, I have definitely had better. My friend had the meatballs and said it was just okay. She didn't even want to take them home. My other friend had the spinach ravioli and also said they were just fine, nothing special. My friends had the special ravioli with an assortment of lobster, spinach, and some other kind of ravioli in vodka sauce and they thought it was pretty decent. My bf had the cacio de Pepe and it was horrible. It had probably 3x as much black pepper as it needed. I tried it and there were so many big chunks of black pepper everywhere. It was so overboard and unappetizing. Almost inedible.

The wait staff was nice to us but we are pretty sure they completely forgot to put in our dinner order. We waited a",1
The Uni Don at this sushi spot was a real treat! The rice was perfectly seasoned and the salmon and tuna were large and fresh. We would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for some top-notch sushi.,1
"The food was Delicious, but the wait time was ridiculous. We waited over an hour for a table, even though we had made a reservation. The front desk told us that the table might be available in 30 minutes, but it turned out to be more like 45 minutes. We had to ask multiple times for updates, and our food arrived together after we ordered it. The shrimp dumplings were delicious, but I dropped one of them on the floor. Overall, the food was great, but the wait time was frustrating.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The banhmi was my favorite dish - it was very flavorful and the bread was thin and flaky. There was plenty of filling: pickled carrots and radish, cilantro, pate, ham and grilled pork. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I love this place! The food is so cheap and the quality is really good. I got a small tin of rice, char siu pork, and a drizzle of veggies, and it was enough food for two of us. It was also cheaper than bubble tea at any chain restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"This was a great restaurant and the service was phenomenal! The steak was the best I've ever had and the atmosphere was really nice. The only downside was that some of the dishes were not gluten free, but that didn't bother us too much. We would definitely come back!",1
"Empellón Al Pastor is a great bar for drinks with friends. The margaritas are delicious and the prices are reasonable. The food is also fantastic, and the specials are always changing. The bathroom code is a great way to make sure you don't get lost, and the staff is always very friendly.",1
"The views from the rooftop at this restaurant are really great! The food was quite good, too. We ordered the burger, lobster roll, and French fries. The burger was really good, and the lobster roll was also very good. The French fries were pretty good, too. The waiter came with a warm sea salt chocolate chip cookie and candle, which was really nice. We had a great night here! I would definitely love to come back for brunch.",1
"Anton's was great! My boyfriend and I walked in at 6:15 weeknight and got a table outside. The Angel hair Francese was the best thing we ate, though the skin on the Roasted heritage chicken was also amazing. Baby potatoes and Flourless Chocolate tart with sour cream for dessert were also decent. I like that the food here is deceptively simple - everything was really flavorful, though uncomplicated in appearance/description. Next time: I want to try the steak and spinach ravioli. 4.5 stars.",0
"Love this Thai fusion. Came in for lunch and tried their lunch specials with appetizers, and everything was good.We got the leaf-wrapped chicken, which was grilled and then fried. Dipping it in the sweet sauce was very yummy. Definitely worth the messiness for unwrapping it.Got a red curry shrimp and a garlic beef. I love both as you really cannot go wrong with garlic and red curry. It's fusion so they got broccoli and such in the dish, expected and delicious, so no complaints.The sides were less impressive. A little on the oily side and the salad too sweet with the peanut sauce. I like their soup better.Good service and short wait. Nice decoration and vibes!",0
"I had a great time revisiting this restaurant, especially since they've got some of the best vegan crepes around! The La Lolotte crepe is particularly delicious - it's savory and sweet and has a great texture. The La Paysanne crepe is also great - it's a little more egg-like in texture and is even more delicious. They also have a great selection of coffee drinks, which is great given how much I love coffee. All in all, this is a great spot for a casual meal or coffee break.",1
"Overall, the food was all right, but I was bothered by what happened two nights ago. We were sitting outside, without masks obviously, and they dropped off our food. One of my dishes they dropped off was the wrong one. A few minutes later they picked it up, said they dropped the wrong dish, and brought the right one. I didn't touch it and didn't have time to realize it was the wrong dish (both were veggies). What I wondered later, though, was whether they brought that dish to someone else?! After it was on our table for a few minutes and we were without masks?",1
"I had a really enjoyable time at this restaurant! The food was delicious, and service was quick. The outdoor seating was really cute, and I loved the people watching opportunities. I would definitely come back here!",1
"I visited Pocha 32 to meet with a friend after someone had recommended the spot to me. I had never been but heard that it was a good place to grab drinks and enjoy some tasty dishes. When my friend and I arrived we opted to sit outdoors since this was during the COVID pandemic and neither of us had gotten the vaccine at that point in time. After going upstairs to let the hostess know we had arrived they led us to a table downstairs in their outdoor set up and gave us time to look over the menu. When it came time to order we went with the corn cheese ($13), the BBQ beef ($29), and a Korean pancake who's real name is lost in my mind. Between two people these dishes proved to be a lot. They're generous with their portion sizes so I'd suggest going here with a group. Along with the plates being large the food was also really tasty! I'd recommend coming here with friends for a casual night out or before going to one of the various bars in the area.",0
"I was really impressed with Melt Shop! The grilled cheese was delicious and the Parmesan fries were fantastic. The only downside was that they didn't have halal meat options, but overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Great tasting food! But there are some downsides. What's cool about this place is the low hanging lights and it's BYOB policy. So most nights it's packed with college students celebrating birthdays -- who is surprised? no one. Been here on 4 occasions at different times of day. Come for lunch if you want to be able to hear the person across from you. There's a lot less people then. If you come in the evening, especially on a weekend, expect to wait a couple minutes. I'm usually willing to trade off some things for a cool experience but my last two visits have been underwhelming for the following reasons:1. Service: When my boyfriend and I tried to split an entree, we were rudely told that we must order an entree per person. Our server tried to guilt us with the fact that people wait a long time to get a seat here and he'd rather have other guests at our table who order more than us. 2. Portions: One entree isn't enough to split with someone. Even if you're ok with smaller portions, $15-$20 for a small dinner entree feels like too much. 2. Too Loud: In the evening at least, the music is way loud. Then add the sound of loud drunk young people. I had to make a huge effort to hear the person across from me. If you're already overwhelmed by the low ceilings and lights, and tight seating, the noise might be over the top. If you're coming here to get drunk, you might be less sensitive to this. Otherwise, be advised.",0
"I was very surprised by how close the texture and taste of the vegan tuna at this restaurant was to the real thing. The dumplings were decent, but the highlight was the vegan tuna. It was spicy and delicious. The other rolls we had were also tasty and felt very healthy. The sesame cookie and green tea ice cream were larger than expected and I liked the subtle matcha flavor paired with the deep black sesame cookie. Service was fast and prompt. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great vegan meal.",1
"The best thing about Brick Lane is the lunch special, which is available Monday-Friday from 12-4pm. For only $14, you get a curry of your choice, plus an additional vegetable curry, lentils of the day, rice, and naan. A great deal that has me taking days off from work just so I can experience it. The  food is quite good but not extraordinary. The curry choices are arranged from most mild (tikka masala) to most spicy (the legendary phaal curry). I opted for the vindaloo, the second spiciest, which was too clove-heavy for me to really enjoy. The next time I came, I got the madras, which is the third spiciest one. It was a delicious and modestly spiced rich orange-colored sauce. I also couldn't resist ordering a side of the phaal curry (since I wasn't brave enough to commit my entire entree to it!) and it was very spicy as promised. I couldn't have eaten an entire plate of it, but I enjoyed using it as a garnish on my milder curry and on the lentil soup. It also has a lot of garam masala/clove notes - again, not my favorite flavor profile. (But I did bring the leftover phaal home to add a little fiery garnish to all my meals for the rest of the week!)Apart from the lunch special, I'm not really in the biggest hurry to come here, because $17 for a vegetarian curry or $20+ for a meat curry just seems like a little too much. Finally, it is worth noting how cute the interior of the restaurant is - perfect for a date spot, especially if you want to have a spice endurance competition!",0
"Excellent, delicious pizza and sandwiches. Fantastic imported ingredients, but I kinda wish they went the handmade homemade route, then it'd feel more like I was supporting a local mom and pop shop? When I ordered a ""ripiena,"" they kindly explained that they couldn't make the version that was on the menu because everything was being imported all the way from Italy, but I know of lots of places nearby that make their own porchetta, and that little bit extra helps it not feel like a chain restaurant? Not that I'm against chain restaurants, per se, but if I'm spending $10 for a small sandwich at a chain restaurant, then it feels like it should come with a side dish and soda. Anyhow, that's just me (rambling). I obsessed for two days over the zucchini and onion pizza I had, and the prosciutto arugula burrata pizza was a thing of beauty; and, roman-style (flaky fluffy crunchy chewy) pizza is absolutely my preference over the soggy oily cheesy generic square slices that keep popping up everywhere...",0
"Overall, I had a good time at this restaurant. The service was a bit slow and our waiter forgot to bring some things we asked for, but the food was good. I recommend the Latin Soleil drink and the Marguerite drink, but be aware that the sangria is apparently good as well. The decor is cool, but the seats are really uncomfortable.",1
"I've eaten here because this is one of the few places in this area since covid that is still open 24 hours. The food is not amazing, but it is a huge deli that doubles as a grocery store. Very handy for late nights. You can find all the essentials like milk, cereal, bread, yogurt, juice, pastries, chips, peanut butter, jellies, fruits, etc. In terms of prepared food, they have a breakfast area, cold cut sandwiches, sushi, smoothies, hot food, soups, and salads. Their sandwiches are decent. The prices are reasonable too with breakfast sandwiches in the $2 to $5 range, and most cold cut sandwiches in the $5 to $9 range.",0
"I don't even know how to begin.  My experience at this location has ruined all locations for me, and I've been good for a few times per year at the Rockefeller location.  Came in for lunch on the later side, around 1:30pm so it was still busy, but not chaotic.  Service was not as attentive.  Ordered the steaktip salad medium and the steak was literally still raw like it had just come out of the freezer and defrosted.  wth overall bad memory and I think poorly of my companions who I dined with just because of this experience",0
I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was great. I especially loved the sushi and dumplings. The dips were also great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Chelsea Market.,1
I've been to this location a few times now and I always have a great time here. The seafood is good for its price. I  usually get a pound of shrimp and a side of pasta for myself and some appetizers for the table. I took my parents here and they loved it too! The location is great as well and they take reservations!,0
"Got a slice of the Fresh Mozz ($4). It was as big as my head!Good overall, however it did not knock my socks off. I can see the appeal with the thin and extremely crispy crust. But it's crispy because it's so dry; eating the edge of the crust that had no sauce was a chore.Fresh mozz looked tantalizing until I realized that it was dry and stringy like regular mozzarella; it wasn't soft and melty as it looked to be.Long line, but it moves fast.",0
"ZibZoob Thai Ratings: 3.8/5 Food: 3.75/5 - Decided to come here for lunch near where I work. Got the chicken green curry lunch special, and it comes with a side salad and a small spring roll (the sides were okay, but nothing special about it). However, the green curry tasted amazing; it's creamy, thick but refreshing. It's very easy to eat and not greasy at all, definitely pretty good quality food. Make sure to dump the rice in the curries, the only way to do it. All ingredients including the veggies and meat were fresh. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy. Keep in mind that, it was pretty spicy for me so definitely one of the spicer green curries that I have tried in NYC. I recommend red curry if you can't eat spicy food. Overall, good experience here for something casual. Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Located near the Vessel and Hudson Yards. The interior is pretty small with a small cocktail bar area. There's plenty of seats and tables available for dining in and people are separated fairly well due to COVID-19. Interior is somewhat dimly-lit with a homey vibe and noise level is fairly quiet. Price: 4/5 - Generous portion and reasonable pricing for most of the dishes on the menu. The chicken green curry lunch special was around $15 after tax. Decent value and worth if you looking for a quick lunch.Service: 3.75/5 - Pretty decent customer service, super genuine and courteous people too. The staffs working here are all pretty friendly and welcoming, and the food came out fast, fresh, and hot. Nothing too special or outstanding about the overall service though. BLUF: Tried many Thai places in the Hudson Yards area, definitely would say this is probably the better ones in the area. Recommend the curries and their lunch special deals. I will return again for their duck curries soon. Also, menu has many option and varieties, so worth checking it out.",0
"Nice staff with good service and glad to have a vegan restaurant nearby, but totally bland food. Completely lacking in salt and vinegar, making it not worth a second try for me. Even the dumplings sauce was flavorless. I was severely disappointed. The rice roll was fine but again, flavorless except for the subtle taste of char. Mushroom sloppy had no flavor at all. I was really sad because I was so looking forward to our visit.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good but the service could use some improvement. The bread is definitely one of the highlights, though!",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The music was ridiculously loud and my ears were ringing after dinner. The food wasn't worth coming back for either - I had the shakshouka and it was on the slightly spicier side, but it doesn't come with pita so you have to order it separately. The hummus was also freshly made, but it wasn't appealing enough for me to return and deal with the noise.",1
"Jadis is a hidden gem in the Lower East Side that I would highly recommend! The wine bar is decorated with ancient bricks and the ceiling is bricked, creating a semi-dark space that is both relaxing and intimate. The food was delicious, and the service was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely visit Jadis again!",1
"I have been 99 favor person since moving to NYC, but recently tried out Hometown hotpot and I have to say I think it beats 99 by a long shot. Centrally located in Little Italy this place has a better selection of meats and vegetables for the hot pot. The broth is also less oily which I really appreciate. Great customer service and cheap beer. Will definitely be back next time I have company visiting.",0
This restaurant is not up to par with the high ratings it has. The food was bland and not spicy at all. The banchan was also tasteless. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1
"Keepin it real out here in Midtown (West)I honestly don't quite remember the detail because it was from a while back. But the location is convenient if you work in Midtown, it's along bunch of other decent restaurants. The food itself was solid, straightforward. I got a pad thai (basic i know) and it was definitely to my liking, will probably visit again and try something else next time.",0
"Overall, I thought brunch at this restaurant was pretty good. The food was tasty and well-made, but I thought it was a bit on the average side. I was very pleased with the nova eggs Benedict, though, as it was one of the highlights of the meal. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite noisy and difficult to have a conversation in. The service was good, though, and the mimosas were a nice touch.",1
"Basically home style Chinese food served in a semi chipotle style way. Food is good, but not super good and I can't say it beats an average Chinese home cook. They forgot my toppings so :( real sad about that Presentation could use a lot more work if they made the food in front of you, chipotle style.",0
"The back room at this restaurant is definitely worth the wait - the cocktails are some of the best I've had in New York City. The menu is divided into light appetizers (like cold Japanese noodles) and heavier main course drinks (like cold pizza and mango sticky rice), with the sweeter drinks serving as dessert. I tried the cold Japanese noodle and key lime pie, and both were fantastic. The noodle drink was light and refreshing, with a savory flavor from the sesame oil. The key lime pie was even better - creamy, fizzy, and tart with a lingering taste of winter melon. It was an unexpected Asian twist that made it even more delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great cocktail and some delicious food.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food at this restaurant. The skewers were a bit underseasoned and the lamb, eggplant, and pig trotters were all a bit bland. The only dish that I found to be decent was the Copper Pot Frogs which were nicely diced and had a nice kick. The restaurant was quite empty when we visited, so I'm guessing that the food isn't that popular.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this restaurant - the atmosphere is really cozy and the cocktails are top-notch. The only downside is that it took a while for any waitress to take our order, and it was a bit frustrating that other tables nearby were getting service before us. The oysters were also really delicious - I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to try more drinks!",1
"I went to Maison Pickle for the first time ever and I have to say, my experience was nothing short of fantastic. Our server and the atmosphere was top notch. Everyone was so friendly and was very COVID cautious.We started out our dinner with the Crab and Artichoke Dip which was excellent! It was served with toasted bread chips that were so good. Our second appetizer was the Honey Butter pull apart bread. I cannot rave enough about this bread. It was SO good. It was honestly one of the best foods I have tasted to this day. I was in awe! My boyfriend and I split the Buffalo Mac and Cheese and it was excellent. It was not too spicy and it was creamy and delicious. For dessert, we ordered the Oreo Ice Box pie and the Creme Brûlée. The Oreo ice box pie was huge and it tasted so good! And of course, the creme brûlée was delicious. Overall, this restaurant was a solid 10/10. I would definitely come back here!",0
"ROLLN is exactly what you'd expect. Pros include: clean space, trendy spot, fresh fish, extremely short wait. Cons: little seating, high bar stools, expensive for small portions I stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered on one of their kiosks. I balked at the prices-- each roll was $3.75 and up and they did not seem that big. There were combo meals of 2 rolls with edamame, and a bento box, but I didn't feel like it was worth the price. I decided to order a shrimp tempura handroll and a salmon avocado hand roll. My order was ready in about 2 minutes. The quality of the fish was on point! It tasted very fresh. I was surprised that I wasn't that hungry after the meal, even though the rolls were pretty small. Each is about 5 inches long. Even though the rolls tasted good, I probably wouldn't come back because they were relatively simple and I can't justify paying almost $9 for it.",0
"Having grown up in CA, I've had amazing and cheap tacos my whole life. So when we came to visit NYC, we almost passed on trying Los Tacos No.1 since we can get good tacos any day at home. However, I am so glad we decided to give it a try because their tacos definitely earned the hype and great reviews. We ordered 3 Carne Asada (Grilled Steak) tacos and 2 Adobada (Marinated Pork) tacos. I will say that I had really high hopes for this spot, partially because we were paying almost $5 per taco. The most expensive tacos I've had in CA still only cost about $2 each, so you can see where I'm coming from. Then we finally bit into our tacos and instantly nodded in satisfaction. The first thought was how tender and flavorful the meat was, then the freshness of the tortillas. We went with corn tortillas for all of our tacos. You can literally see them making it fresh in front of you, from the presser straight onto the grill and onto your plate. We also didn't notice that they had a salsa bar against one side of the wall until we were almost done, so that's also saying something about how great these tacos were.100% recommend stopping by for some amazing tacos when you're in NYC. They have multiple locations as well and even though there will likely be a line, it moves pretty quick!",0
"This place was delicious!! It's a small shop with no seating inside but they have some small tables that seat 2 / table outside. There's usually a line here and a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth trying or frequenting. Affordable prices, friendly service, and delicious fusion yubu. I highly recommend the bulgogi  (not pictured). They also had some fun drinks if you wanted to pair your food with tea / juice.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant specifically for the macaroons, and I was a bit disappointed. They had an amazing selection, numerous gelato flavors to compliment, and great overall customer service. I don't remember which flavor macaroons I got, but I do remember they were good! Lol",1
"Nice place to satisfy food cravings. The soup dumplings were good, not great. Enjoyed the duck dan dan noodles, spare ribs and scallion pancakes. When I went they were days away from getting their liquor license and were still BYOB. Looks like they will have some nice patio space once the weather gets warmer.",0
"Wish I had read the reviews before I ordered. If it wasn't freezing cold out I would've checked and gone elsewhere. Got the lunch special of shrimp with black bean sauce over brown rice and wonton soup. ALL of it was completely flavorless! The wonton soup had nothing to it. Flavorless broth and three wontons and that's it. No pork, no seaweed...nothing else... just some yellow broth and all of three wontons! The shrimp with black bean sauce was equally unappealing! No flavor at all so I had to drown it in hot sauce and soy sauce. I can totally see why they have such terrible reviews... Will never come here again!",0
"The dumplings at this spot were not my favorite. They were a little too doughy for me and the filling was sparse. However, they're only $5 for 10 so I can't really complain. I've heard that the lady at this spot changes the price all the time, so you might get a better deal if you come here often.",1
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was pretty nice. The food was creative and beautifully demonstrated, and the drinks can be lacking in flavors if you don't mixed it well. However, I was disappointed that they don't have the happy hour menu anymore. The prices were a bit high, but I guess that's to be expected in a nice place like this. Overall, I would recommend it to girls looking for a nice place to hang out.",1
"The people here must not like me on three different occasions; they had forgotten my order.  This issue has spanned over two years, and I don't come too often. I understand the place is busy but do not placate me by telling me ""5 minutes more,"" and after 30 minutes acknowledged, they had forgotten the order.  The food is not worth the aggravation of waiting for congee that cooks less than a minute. New Wong and Wu's Wonton King restaurants are better alternatives.",0
"I recently went to this restaurant and I absolutely loved it! The outdoor dining area is so cute and the food was amazing. The only downside is that it took a bit long to get our food, but it was definitely worth the wait. The chairs are not very close together, so it can be a bit difficult if you're not used to that, but overall it's a great place to eat. I would definitely recommend it!",1
"This restaurant was incredible! The food was top notch and the service was amazing. We had a great time eating here and would definitely recommend it to others. The only downside was that it was a bit cold outside, but that didn't stop us from enjoying our meal.",1
"I'm glad I finally got the chance to check out Rubirosa - the lines can be incredibly long, but the pizza is definitely worth the wait. The tie dye pizza was delicious - the crust was so thin and perfect, and the clams were great. The carbonara was also good, but my wife's is really better. I really liked the black and white tagliatelle too - it was a great blend of squid ink pasta and classic tagliatelle. The service was great too - our server, John, was very attentive and attentive to our needs. I definitely recommend checking out Rubirosa - the pizza is definitely worth it!",1
"In town for the weekend and wanted a simple lunch near the hotel. Vietnamese always hits the spot and this place looked decent.Loved the seated QR ordering, grouped or all together at the table to pay and all digital. So easy! I wish more places did this.The place slowly filled up and was packed when we left. They were also doing a very brisk to go business. We had the summer rolls (okay, nothing exceptional) that did the job. The limeade soda was awesome and very authentic. The banh mi sandwich had perfect crispy bread, not too thick and good vegetables. The meat was just so so. Not very traditional. The pho was very flavorful and didn't need any extra doctoring plus was very good sized! This is a great option for a simple lunch. Prices are typical NY - high side.Service was excellent and food came out fast. Recommend.",0
"Can't recommend this place enough. Super unique flavor but fair warning the ""mala"" sauce they use is very spicy because they use a lot of pepper corn (that spice that lingers on your tongue)As a vegetarian, the tofu is phenomenal, I've tried them all and have never been disappointed. The vegetables are perfectly good (cooked with a perfect crunch factor to them).  The apps are great too, the one pictured is the Dan Dan noodles. The only thing I'm not a fan of are the drinks. I didn't love the flavors and they were pretty diluted. They have massive portions, you can get one bowl with 4-5 add ons (plus 1-2 proteins) and can split it. I've already gone here 10+ times and have always had a great experience!",0
"This year, my family chose hot pot as our theme for our annual Chinese New Year celebratory banquet. A big shoutout to ECHO here with our specifics for our reservation, at a heartbeat we knew this was IT!Promptly seated we were this busy Saturday night.  Separated into a boys and a girls tables. Amazing and efficient were the servers including spotting the specific broths for those with dietary needs!Plate after plate of beautifully sliced beef and lamb.  Plentiful choices of fresh vegetables including exotic mushrooms. Seafood galore including soft shell crabs. Fantastic broths, faves:herbal & spicy!Many hot pots around the city I've visited. Yet, with this 99 Favor Taste's hospitality and memorable time, I am recommending them highly for parties and for me to come many times over every year!CHEERS!",0
"My friend and I popped in here after taking a Pilates class nearby and thankfully we didn't have to wait too long for a table. We ordered the kale salad to start and the Luca pizza to share and both were delicious. The service was a little slow, but besides that would absolutely go back again!",0
"Los Tacos No. 1 is a must-go spot for tacos in Manhattan. The tacos are fresh and made with high-quality ingredients, and the staff is friendly and attentive. The only downside is that the restaurant is small and can get crowded, so be prepared to wait a bit.",1
I was really surprised by how good this bowl of food was! The bbq sauce was delicious and the vegetables were tangy. I would have never reached for a bowl like this but I am so glad I did. The flavors were like an explosion in your mouth. I can't wait to try more off the menu!,1
"DISCLAIMER: my stars are more for the bar aspect than the restaurant aspect. Loved the vibes and the drinks more than the food!I came here a couple times now for Sunday boozy brunches and its always a good time! atmosphere wise- always great music, everyones just having the best time...including the servers.We do the pitcher of margarita which they have interesting flavors like Blueberry coconut and Apricot thyme...doesnt really taste like what you'd expect but its still delicious and does the job ;) Don't have to worry about BYOB.For food, I tried their tacos which were all pretty whatever. And they don't let you mix n match your tacos, so all 3 have to be the same flavor which was kind of annoying. Their quesadilla was good and their table side gauc is definitely bomb though!One thing i wish is that they had better dessert options instead of the limited couple things they have. But I guess theres a bunch of options once you step out onto any neighboring block.Return? For sure! Craving another HH soonRecommend? Yes if you're in a party mood",0
"I recently visited Yo's Indian Buffet for lunch and was very impressed! The all-you-can-eat lunch special was only about $18 including tax and tip, which is a great deal. I tried the chicken tikka masala, beef curry, saag, and puri (I think that's what it's called) and all of them were very good. I especially enjoyed the puri. One downside is that I saw a cockroach near the bathroom, but it ran away. Overall, this place is worth visiting if you're hungry for Indian food.",1
"Needed to find a new Szechuan place since Szechuan Mountain House in St. Marks is always so packed, and came across Zest, which was a pleasant surprise!My Szechuan favorite soup is the fatty beef picked mustard so I had to have it here and I was not let down! It was deliciously flavorful and not too spicy. The pot is big enough for a few to share if you get other dishes. I came with only one other friend so we got the fatty beef soup and a stir fried pork cabbage dish which was also very tasty!The service was also very efficient and friendly. After out meal, we stayed to chat a bit and even though the restaurant was full, they kept coming over to refill our tea. I will be back to try more of the dishes!",0
"The food here was a bit bland and the service was slow. However, the presentation was great and I'd come back for a meal.",1
"Sup Crab is a fantastic crawfish restaurant! The crawfish are much more plump and savory than any I've ever had, and their crispy scallion pancakes are a must-try. The super-group boil is great for a group of 4, each bag has a lot of plump shrimp and a large buttery crab (if chosen). The potatoes and corn sucked up all the flavorful boil marinade and made the meal complete. I am definitely looking forward to trying the rest of their boil options!",1
"I was really pleased with the super nachos I ordered. The chili was a good option, but I would swap it out for something else next time. The steak was also really good, though I could have done with a little more seasoning. The salsa ranchera was also good. The cook (probably the owner) is Chinese and the atmosphere is very casual. This is a great place to eat if you're looking for a casual meal.",1
"I wish I had a photo to add, but I was so hungry and ate it so quickly. The 'Flank & Brisket Pho' was delicious! And the people there are so nice!!! I will definitely be back. It's located conveniently outside the Christopher St 1 station.",0
I had a great time at Pepe Rosso Social! The atmosphere was really cozy and the food was excellent. I especially loved the oxtail pappardelle and the fettucini with shrimp and asparagus. The Nutella tiramisu was also really good. I would definitely come back if I were in the area.,1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and the service was very slow, but it seemed like there was only one waitress for all the tables. I would definitely recommend this place to others and I'm looking forward to returning soon!",1
"I try not to give 1 star reviews, but I just had dinner here and haven't felt this ripped off in a while. This placed is housed in the Gotham Market Food Court in Hells Kitchen on 11th ave and 44th street.  The food court wasn't overly busy when I arrived around 6pm on a Sunday, and there was a good amount of seating still available, which is good.  Also, the line at Ivan Ramen wasn't bad at all (just one person ordering in front of me).  I got the Tokyo Shoyu Ramen ($14).  It came out to $15.24 with tax.  Once I saw the bowl I knew I was in trouble because it was so little food.  The broth isn't horrible but it kind of tastes like a soy sauce based instant ramen.  The noodles also taste like it came from an instant packet, which isn't necessarily bad, but it is when it costs $15.24.  The one piece of pork belly is tasty, but it's just one piece.  The soft egg was nicely cooked IMO.  I was just so angry that the whole bowl was done after 3 bites.  In conclusion, Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop in Gotham Market sucks.  The bowl of ramen should be $7 tops.  Don't make the same mistake I did and go to the other highly rated ramen places around the area instead.",0
"Ruby's is my go-to brunch or dinner spot around the area! I love the interior and vibe. And I get the Shrimp Pasta everytime (it's a must!). Also, check out the sweet potato fries with chili - it's AMAZING!!! I like it over the truffle fries with aioli. I would pass on the side salad and please keep in mind the portions are smaller so I would recommend ordering some sides if you come with a group :) Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!",0
Given the current situation finding food and the delivery of food has been difficult. I just want to say thank you for the easy delivery.Wanted to try some falafel today and my mother recommended you guys. You donated food to her job and she loved it. Thank you for that as well.As far as falafel goes its seasoned nicely and taste great. My favorite part is the hummus! Its creamy and hearty like I like and has a fresh taste to it. I love the red cabbage nice and crisp and has a good bite to it. The pickled vegetables with their green pica sauce on top; amazing. The whole plate taste great and I am very happy I gave them a try. The plate was definitely a good experience. I enjoy eating plates of food with lots of color and this did not disappoint. So if you enjoy Mediterranean vegetarian food or just want a break from meat definitely give them a try,0
"Stopped by this place on our way to a broadway show for what we thought was the perfect snack before the show in theater district! The line was long but it went so quick. At first the food tasted amazing, the chicken had an indian tikka flair to it and it was the perfect small bite before a show but 6 hours later we have horrible nausea and food poisoning from it :( hoping it was just a bad one time thing but wanted to share the experience",0
"I was hesitant to try this restaurant given the current state of the food industry, but I'm glad I did. The food was delicious, especially the falafel. It was seasoned well and had a great taste. I also really enjoyed the hummus, it was creamy and hearty and had a fresh taste. The pickled vegetables were also amazing, they had a good bite and were seasoned well. The red cabbage was also very good, it had a good crunch and had a fresh taste. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at Gramercy Greek Restaurant. The quality of the food didn't justify the high price tag. The spanakopita was good, but the other dishes were quite overpriced and it led to an underwhelming experience. The drinks were okay, but I remember the prices for drinks being quite steep. Overall, I think there are a lot of other Greek restaurant choices out there that are much better. I would not recommend Gramercy Greek Restaurant.",1
"I highly recommend this restaurant! The decor and atmosphere are amazing, and the food is really good. There are a lot of options to choose from on the menu, and the items are all really well-made. I especially loved the Tom Yum Soup and the Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewer. The only downside is that the ratio of meat to sugar cane is a bit low, so you don't get that much meat per skewer. Otherwise, everything was really good. I would definitely come back here.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but the atmosphere and cleanliness could use some improvement. The price is a bit high, but overall I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"First thing you notice when walking in here is how it is festively decorated and has greenery all around. Also loved that on a Saturday night, it's not raucous or ragey (can you tell I'm an old lady?). Everyone is engaged in conversation and it's low-key and more mature than surrounding pubs. Last, there's a long communal table in the middle in addition to a bunch of booths and the bar area. Great place to hang with friends and catch up. Came with two girlfriends and kicked it at the long table. It's just so cozy and relaxing. Service is prompt. They got drinks, I tagged along, so this review might be premature, but I seriously enjoyed spending time here, so I had to tell the world. Trivia night every Tuesday in the upstairs, and loads of British fare, so I'd love to return to have a proper meal.",0
"So I have to say this place was disappointing. I heard such raving reviews but ultimately there was nothing special. The fish shaped scallion pancake was too doughy and not crispy enough in my opinion. The yellowtail was delicious and well done. That said, the scallion oil flavor profile is nothing new. It was good though. The beef tartare was forgettable. It comes with this mallet to break the kelp cracker. Definitely more for the gram than anything. And the kelp leaves a sticky gumminess in your mouth. The""mad toast"" had summer truffles which really doesn't taste like truffles or anything for that matter. That's not a jab at their execution but a criticism of summer truffles in general. It's just not very flavorful. The chicken or the egg was probably the worse dish. It was basically a chicken wing. Supposedly it was stuffed with foie gras meatball but I tasted no such thing. The American wagyu was the best dish. It was perfectly cooked and the vegetable wraps complemented it well. Too bad that alone is not good enough to carry the entire dinner. The rice with bone marrow (we added the uni) was fine but again, nothing special. The green tea dessert at the end was good and not too sweet. The service was very good and you can tell they actually know the menu. There was one confusing moment when he tried to explain that they were taking off the wagyu soon and had kalbi as an option. Would've just been easier to say kalbi is an option. Also there was a lull at some point before our entree courses came. Overall, was there anything wrong with Little Mad? Other than the missing foie gras, no. The food was fine. Just not impressive. For the price, I'd much rather go to Jua. I would not come back nor recommend it. Go to their sister restaurant Jua. One last note, the outdoor dining structure outside needs to go. It looks like shanty town and not a good first look for someone coming to a nice restaurant.",0
"We came here for a dueling pianos brunch option. We arrived and were promptly seated and given our requisite mimosas -- we decided to do unlimited. The waitstaff was very good about keeping the drinks flowing.I ordered the avocado toast with scrambled eggs and boyfriend ordered the burger. My avocado toast came with fennel/dill, pickled onions, and hot sauce to accompany it. My dish needed a lot of hot sauce because the toast itself wasn't very flavorful. Boyfriends dish was good, he reported out, but I think it's really hard to mess up a burger and upon further taste testing, it was fine. The real reason we were there, the dueling pianos, were pretty good, definitely 4/5 stars! The hosts did a great job keeping the crowd engaged and had great renditions of a few really random songs.Overall, would not recommend the food, but would recommend the dueling pianos!",0
"We really enjoyed our meal here and this was the second time we came here. The first time was for brunch and I had the chicken on pita with melted cheese and my husband had a burger and we both really enjoyed it. We then came for dinner and also really enjoyed what we ordered. They serve you hummus and bread to start and the hummus is amazing. It is creamy and has a lemony flavor to it. We then got the zucchini and eggplant chips which was also amazing. They were perfectly crispy and a generous portion. We also got the Greek salad which was also great and fresh. My husband ordered the mussels, but didn't love them. I didn't have them, but they smelled pretty fishy. He also got the sea bass and liked it, but probably wouldn't order it again. Overall, we enjoyed our food.",1
"You would never dream that this place is in the busiest part of Times Square - it's tucked away down a few steps and you enter a truly wonderful and sometimes loud, fabulous restaurant!Years ago I found them when they had a placard on the street saying Chocolate pasta. Well...I lost all desire for where we were headed and walked down into Da Marinos. You enter into the galley bar to the hostess stand. Used to be we never had to wait, but wow, now you HAVE to have reservations or you sit at the bar, IF all those seats aren't taken already. I have to be honest, I've never had a thing off the menu except the chocolate pasta with shrimp. It's making my mouth water just thinking about it. Everyone I've been with laughs at my choice and they get traditional Italian dishes. I'm assuming, having never been to Italy, that chocolate pasta isn't a regular dish but who am I to say that?? It's delicious! My friends and family never have had a complaint about their dishes and also never complain that I always want to go here, so I'm taking from that that their dishes are as delicious as mine!Sometimes there's a pianist at night! I try to sit close to him because I'd rather hear piano than my neighboring tables conversations. A great decision. You get bread before dinner and can barely move after my pasta so I haven't had desserts here. Their wine list is a winner and they also have a full bar. Bathrooms are clean, but not huge, of course. And parking? Seriously?? I wouldn't survive driving around Times Square on any night of the week. Uber or subway if you value your life! Please go see what I'm raving about but don't tell too many people - I need my chocolate pasta!!",0
"The banh mi at this restaurant was decent, but I didn't love it. The pate was a nice touch, but it wasn't amazing. I feel like it could have used a bit more flavor. Overall, it was a decent experience.",1
"I had a great time at Ruby's for brunch! The restaurant is really cute and the waitstaff is super nice and attentive. The menu for brunch is great and I was able to find something for everyone. I especially loved the egg sandwich - it was delicious! The BLT with egg was probably my favorite. The brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and seasoned and were very addictive. The French fries were also great, and I really enjoyed the double friend. Overall, I had a great experience and I hope to be back soon!",1
"I was really disappointed with the pizza at Joe's Pizza. The crust was limp and the ingredients were quite ordinary. It cost a lot more than other slices in New York City, which was a shame. I didn't find anything special about the pizza at all.",1
"I was really disappointed with my cronut dupe at this restaurant. The cronut itself is greasy and the filling is too sweet. However, their coffee and tea menu is great and I was able to cut down on the greasiness by ordering a cup of iced tea. The cake itself is very good, though a little on the pricey side. The cream is very smooth and milky, and the cake is very spongy. Overall, I think this restaurant is worth checking out, but I would recommend ordering something else besides the cronut.",1
"I've had really good dinner here, but it's a little pricy for what it is. The spinach artichoke dip is amazing and usually they'll give you more chips because there's never enough in the beginning. I also love the French dip with au jus and the shoestring fries it comes with. Recently I also got the ahi tuna salad and it was amazing. The dressing on the salad is perfect and it is pretty filling. I would recommend coming here.",0
"I really enjoyed the pizza here! My boyfriend and I got 4 slices. I have to say my personal favorite was The Grandma!The flavor was just amazing. Perhaps it was because I ate this slice first that I thought the rest of the slices I tried couldn't compare (which is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5), but my boyfriend loved everything we got. We also had the Bianco, the pepperoni, and the Margherita. I thought the bianco was a bit eh, but my bf really liked it so it's a matter of opinion I guess? But The Grandma is a MUST HAVE!! We would definitely be coming back next time we are in town. I will be crazing these Grandma slices until I return!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The wait was about 30 minutes but it was warm and beautiful outside. We ordered several items which came fairly quickly. Tables were small and seating was a bit tight, but service was fast.

One of my favorites was the Pulut Panggang which had a great dried shrimp flavor. My friends didn't like it so much b/c it was too fishy for them.

The Kaya Butter Toast was also a favorite of mine. After reading all the reviews, we decided to try this and I was very pleasantly surprised!! The flavor of the kaya jam was so unique, perfectly balanced against the warm melted butter. Would definitely recommend folks trying this.

Another favorite was the Pulut Inti which had nothing too special, wouldn't recommend necessarily.

The Penang style hand rolled muah chee was wow, so great. The mochi was super fresh and soft. It comes out warm which makes it so much better! So much softer and flavorful because of the warmth. Also loved the ground peanuts and sesame and with each bite, I would try to dip the rest of my mochi and exposed sticky rice into the ground nut mixture to scoop more of it",1
"As you walk into the pawn shop, you instantly know you are going to have an experience! Beauty & Essex is a glam restaurant that you want to go the extra mile for. The ambiance was sexy, glam yet relaxed. The service from the check-in team to the waiter we had were kind, helpful and were on top of their game from start to finish. Thoroughly impressed by every single detail at Beauty & Essex.What we ordered for Brunch:1. Coffee & Mint Lemonade - great and solid choices2. Red Velvet Waffles - FAVORITE DISH3. Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites - delicious and def love the spin on the dish with biscuits and coleslaw.4. Beauty & Essex Burger - good burger, fries were ON POINT - my husband's favorite dish5. Prime Hanger Steak & Eggs - second favorite dish, hash browns were INCREDIBLE!Although I thought the $17 cocktails were ridiculously pricey (decided to skip it), and some of the dishes were more worth it based on price than others, I would overall recommend this restaurant to a a friend and I definitely would return to try more dishes and maybe even their champagne brunch and dinner! MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION AS THEY ARE ALWAYS PACKED!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The variety in their menu is really impressive, and I loved the mandarin duck dish. The cauliflower dish was also really good, but I didn't enjoy the wontons as much - they have a thicker skin that I don't usually prefer. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"Overall, the food was decent, but the inside ambiance was not as good as we had hoped. We liked the three stars for the food alone, but the lack of heater (which we were told would be fixed) took away from the rating.",1
"I was able to try the cheese hawashi compliments of Zooba/Yelp. Thank you! I ordered at the kiosk by the door and only waited a few minutes for my burger. It was a nice day so I sat in the booths outside. I was pleasantly surprised by how big it was. The pita was VERY crispy giving every bite a nice crunch. The meat was seasoned well with a ton of spices but not salty. I recommend a side of pickles which gave the sandwich some heat and acid. The burger was a little messy to eat but worth it. Next time I will try the koshari, a dish I enjoyed when I was in Egypt.",0
"The Ribeye at Burger Fi was a bit too dry for my taste, and the BBQ sauce was way too much for my taste. The fries were disappointing, with some being crispy and others not being fresh at all. The restaurant itself wasn't very appealing, and I didn't enjoy my meal.",1
"I went to the restaurant recently and it was pretty disappointing. The food was comparably priced to Denny's, but it just didn't taste as good. The shakshuka was watery-thin and the tomato sauce was hardly flavored, so when you try to dip your bread in to catch some of the sauce, it just drips off. The jalapenos were a bit rubbery in texture, and didn't add to the flavor of the dish, but were rather confusing as to why their presence was there, like an unwelcome guest at a party. The eggs were the only part done somewhat-right, but they were bland and unassuming. The nova benny was...not appetizing. The egg was poached, but was rubbery in texture in the tendrils of the egg white wrapping around the yolk. The kale was chewy, tough, and bitter. The bread holding it all together at the bottom was both soggy yet hard. The salmon was chewy and a bit hard to cut through. Overall, the meal was disappointing. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"This restaurant was easily one of my favorite places on my whole trip! Honestly, I was a little skeptical at first because I wanted to try more NY stuff (ex. pizza, bagels, etc), but my friend really wanted to come here and I'm so glad we did. I actually stayed at The Arlo so it was right downstairs. I saw a huge line outside every day so I knew it was going to be good. Our group ordered a bunch of things to share and they were all bombbb. I seriously don't think we tried something we didn't like.

The spicy marinated raw crab is a MUST. It was all of our first times trying this and it was fireee. The crab meat is so fresh and packed with flavor. We also ordered the kimchi pancake, shrimp pancake, KFC, army stew, bulgogi bibimbap, and slow cooked pork. The pork was another one of my favorites as it was super juicy, tender, and flavorful. The army stew was perfect for sharing and literally warmed our souls cuz it was raining that night. To finish off, we got the black sesame ice cream and this was the perfect way to end the meal. Service was very nice",1
"Really great food! I came with a group and ordered the following:-ricotta bruschetta: this was amazing!-beet salad: the table really enjoyed this-meatballs: very good, but I don't think I would get again-Caesar salad: ok. It had too much of an anchovy taste in the dressing-caprese (came with tomatoes and burrata): the burrata was great and the tomatoes were very fresh-carbonara pasta: amazing! I would recommend-Fusilli e Manzo: pasta with braised beef. The pasta was so fresh and this was one of my favorite dishes-Mushroom ravioli: this was amazing and a perfect dish-Capricciosa pizza: this came with Mozzarella, mushrooms, artichokes, prosciutto cotto, kalamata olives, basil. The crust was good, but the middle got soggy and all the toppings fell off.Overall, I would recommend this place.",0
"Wings: flavorful,. Dry rubSteamed fish: doesn't come with rice. I thought it would. Looks like some fish soup. Anyway, flavor was good but fish was fishy. It's not like mackerel fishy but fishy and earthy (subtle dirt like taste like beets). There were several bones big and small. It was good but prob wouldn't get it again. Should've gotten the fried fish but this seemed diff and saw so many good reviews.Service was okay. I tried to get the servers attention a few times. Asked another server for hot sauce/Thai chilies and he never came back so had to ask our server. They gave us the liquid red pepper sauce and another chili thing with garlic and fish sauce. I love the Thai chilies in the vinegar but I haven't seen that anywhere in nyc or nj :( anyway, food was okay... maybe we ordered the wrong things.",0
"The restaurant is delicious. The decor is chic and fits right in being near 5th ave. All the staff are really nice, friendly and helpful! They really know what's on the menu and do a great job suggesting wines and food plates depending on what you are looking for. We sat right at the bar and got to watch the bartender make fun fancy cocktails and ask him all of our questions. I love Mediterranean/Greek food, I studied abroad in Greece and they did a great job of creating a hybrid cuisine of Mediterranean and Greek food. We got a hummus and pita appetizer and the pita was warm and fresh when it came out! The hummus wasn't my absolute favorite, but because it wasn't a middle eastern place I decided to let it slide. For the main course, I got the seafood risotto and it was to die for. It was seasoned perfectly, and the seafood was done just right. I will be back just for that dish!",0
"I came here for happy hour with my friend and drinks are absolutely delicious! Halloumi cheese was a winner.  The dip, meatballs, and zucchini fritters was okay. Cute garden seating and live music! How cute?!!! I dropped one of my napkins and the waiter came quickly to switch out a new one for me. Service was great until I asked one of the waiter to take a picture for me and my friend.My friend and I were straining our necks taking a selfie while a waiter was standing right in front of our table waiting to collect our plates so I asked him to take a picture for us but he refused and said he can't because he has gloves on. =\ Another waiter over heard, quickly intervened and offered to take one for us.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The rice dish was really delicious, and the three sauces they served it with were really tasty. The cilantro sauce was my favorite. And the wintermelon soup was a delicious cup of soup. The restaurant is located in the new Essex Market, and I will definitely be returning. They also serve wings!",1
"I had a really great time at Pizza Beach. The pizza was great, but the kale salad was really something special. The drinks were also great, and the atmosphere was really nice. I can't wait to go back and check out all the other dishes!",1
"Named after Darth Fay-da, I'm not sure if me finding this bakery (which I took my little tiny Sammi Puffle into, in her little pink carrier) was destiny or just a twist of fayda.It's better to burn out than to Fay Da way, and that's what I found out when I came to this cute little Greenwich Village Bakery.In terms of products, and also some of the customers, this is a lovely little Bakery - and I didn't really want to like it because some of the prices are a little on the high side, and the server was extremely unfriendly to me.But as it happened every bite of the spectacular lemon bread was dreamy and delicious and there is no way I can give them less than five stars considering that they are putting out products as good as 85 Degree Bakery, without being a massive chain. Long may they survive and prosper as one of the top Asian bakeries I've been to in NYC.",0
I visited Omakase by Teisui for the second time and it was just as amazing as the first time! The fish was cooked perfectly and the experience was very relaxing. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great meal at a reasonable price.,1
"Dinner for 2. Thursday night (the last one before Christmas).My boyfriend and I wanted to find a quiet, cozy dinner place where we could actually have a conversation before we both were off for the holidays. We went to two spots prior to this in the area but they were all so noisy with it being holiday party season and gatherings galore. I searched ""quiet restaurant"" on Yelp and found Pepe Rosso Social. THANK YOU YELP! We walked in and right away, they gave us the secluded table for 2 right by the window and Christmas tree. It was so romantic and perfect!Oxtail Pappardelle - excellentFettucini w Shrimp, Asparagus - goodNutella Tiramisu - greatI was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food in this intimate place. I would definitely come back if I were in the area...still need to try the cheesecake.",0
"Found this place to order through Seamless for lunch.  Prices for the food are decent but for how it actually tastes probably not so much.  I ordered the fried dumpling, fried vegetables and bulgogi kimbap.  The fried food tasted stale and almost like a day old - just wasn't fresh at all.  The bulgogi meat in the kimbap tasted more like minced meat and was very crumbly - was not very fresh either.  Given all of the other options in Ktown I'd try something else than come here again.",0
"We came here on a weekday with a few of my girls and we had a great time. The margaritas were delicious. I tasted the mango and guava (the guava was my favorite). I also loved the guacamole. The food was flavorful and everyone enjoyed their meal. I want to try the margarita tower next time! I got distracted talking to my girls , but I'll be sure to snap photos next time!",0
"The new spot from the Chinese Tuxedo team just opened in the former Nickel & Diner space. This one is Pan-Asian, with all kinds of different influences across the menu.We tried a bunch of stuff that was all delicious - most notably the Singaporean Chili Crab Fried Rice ($25) and the Stir Fried Rice Noodles with Crispy Tofu ($16). I definitely need to go back to try the Nasi Goreng Crispy Squid Ink Fried Rice ($22) next time.Like Chinese Tuxedo, a big part of this spot is the vibe, which even though is only outdoor dining right now, still provides some of the nicest seating currently possible if you get one of the large booths.",0
"A beautiful space right next to the Hyatt House. I came to Bowery on two occasions, once for dinner and once for breakfast. I had the chicken sandwich for dinner, which lacked much flavor and were it not for the quality of the meat would not have been a good value. The huevos rancheros for breakfast was much better. The service was also great, and there were very few customers both times.",0
"I visited Blue Park Kitchen and found it to be similar to Dig Inn. You pick your base, protein and veggies, but there are also preselected combos available as well. I preferred using the latter means as I'm complicated like that. I ended up with brown rice, blackened chicken, carrots, some curries flavored cauliflower and various sauces that I can't remember. My meal was not bad at all. I would say though that they did too much with their seasonings. The rice for example was very saturated with what seemed like lemon juice. The sauces were good but would have preferred them on the side as a dip. The meats were cooked very well (tried the chicken and steak) but was a smaller portion than I'm used to in similar restaurants. The veggies were also good except for their kale but got lost in the complexity and non complimentary flavors of the food. I'd surmise that this restaurant is good, but figuring out the various combos and what works with what is too much work for me. At a lower price mind you...",1
"I've been to this restaurant a few times and really enjoyed it. However, my most recent visit was not great. They require a food order for every two people, which can be a bit excessive. The menu is also a bit lacking, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The food itself wasn't great, but I could have done without the three bad items we had to get. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but I wouldn't recommend it.",1
"I really enjoyed our meal at Khe-Yo. The spring rolls were delicious, and the salmon curry was really good. I wasn't sure that I would like the pork dish, but it was really good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Overall, the food was pretty good but the service was really questionable. Nobody greeted me when I walked in even though I made eye contact with 3 different workers. Normally I'd let this pass since they were pretty busy, but when my friend came in ~5 min later she also ignored her. We both commented that it was kind of weird but moved on.

We ordered, they served us some bread (YUM) and then our food started coming out. The second dish that came out wasn't what we ordered so we waved down our server and she told me that I must be wrong because she typed exactly what we said, was I sure? I told her yes. She took the dish and we saw her hand the plate off to another worker and throw her arms up in the air obviously unhappy with our interaction. After that service was what you'd expect- positive attitude and water + bread refills.

We actually really enjoyed the food- the stuffed eggplant and the leek appetizers were incredible. They'll give you more bread but save it for when your food starts coming out! The main courses were fine but I think I'd just order more appetizers next time. The service left a really really bad impression on me. Having our",1
"I have heard raving reviews about this place and was excited to try. Being vietnamese from Hanoi, it is hard to find northern pho.The place is next to Penn Station, and is small (30 seats). Service is prompt and friendly. The menu is small and I like it that way. They have pho and fried egg rolls appetizers.- crab egg rolls: AMAZING! JUST LIKE HOME.- pho tai (medium rare beef): 10/10 - Clear broth, wide noodles, no need for hoisin sauce. The beef was cooked in the pho broth and very tender. They even have vinegar pickled garlic!!! I didn't ask for lime, but I should have because they do have limes!! The noodles were dry noodles, not fresh, but I know it's hard to find so I won't rate them lower for that. I like that the staff came to check on me and we chatted about other vietnamese snacks they can do  as well. The bathroom is clean enough.Bonus point for seeing all young, handsome Viet guys in the kitchen (not anyone's grandma or mom)! Keep up the great work, guys!",0
"I thought everything was fantastic. The hotel itself is gorgeous with an abundance of fresh flowers and crystal chandeliers throughout. The palm Court had a beautiful setting and many palms. Our service was great, professional and attentive. We got the Manhattan tea with the Chartier glad of champagne and I thought the champagne was wonderful, very smooth. Our food was fresh with warm scones and soft bread (I read some reviews where this was not the case) and a huge pot of tea for each person. The fat we went everyone was dressed to the nines but was still a relaxing experience.",0
"I visited this small Italian restaurant near the Met and found it to be a great place to eat. The service was excellent and the food was all very good. I especially enjoyed the desserts, which were especially delicious. The only downside was that the prices were a bit high. However, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
This bowl was nothing like I expected. The bbq sauce was delicious and the vegetables were tangy. I would have definitely never reached for a bowl like this but I am so glad I did. The flavors were like an explosion in your mouth. I can't wait to try more off the menu!,0
"Decided to venture a bit further to try something different for lunch with the mealapp.  This place has been on my hit list since I discovered urban space.  However everytime I go to urban space I was looking for a snack instead of lunch or dinner until this day.They offered Mama's Special Chicken so I had to try it.  It's a healthy offering that containshormone-free chicken, bamboo shoot, mushroom, eggplant.  I love that the meal had plenty of sauce so that it gave the rice flavor though it did make me a bit thirsty afterwards.  Some folks might not like so much sauce but I do so take it with a grain of salt.The meal wasn't prepped ahead of time like other places so it took a while for the ingredients to be put together then your name called.  At the same time, the meal was still warmish when I got back to my desk so I can't complain like the other places (which was warm-cold).This place did not disappoint.  I can't wait to try other items.",0
"A bit disappointing...We came around 8:15 on a Tuesday night hoping to get something warm after a cold day. We were brought to the back and seated immediately. They were out of the miso, which I wanted to try, so we both ordered the chicken paitan with cha siu.When the food came out, I was a little surprised how yellow the broth was. It was my first time having chicken paitan though, so maybe that's normal? The cha siu and noodles were fine, but the soup lacked flavor and was quite oily. The kikurage mushroom was also unshredded, thick, and pretty tough. I was surprised to hear that this is a popular destination because I didn't feel like there was anything special.The service was great and pretty quick, but I wouldn't come back.",0
"I had a great experience at Maison Pickle! The food was absolutely delish, and I see why people rave about it now. The bread they use for their thick and fluffy french toast is actually so good. Additionally, the serving size was huge. After eating less than half, I was super full. Even with a party of 11, our food came out really fast. The staff were super friendly and when one of my friends lost their food when it got taken back to the kitchen to get boxed up, they brought out for her an entirely new entree for her to take home, which was such great customer service!

However, they only take reservations for 12 or more if you do their prix fixe menu, which I preferred not to because a lot of my friends had various dietary restrictions. Additionally, even with a reservation for 12pm, we were not seated until 12:40pm. Overall, I had a great experience at Maison Pickle!",1
"I had a great time at this Mexican spot! The drinks are delicious, the food is fresh and the staff is friendly. The only downside is that the place gets pretty crowded, so be prepared to wait. But it's worth it!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for dinner and overall it was decent. The dumplings were definitely homemade, and had a good flavor. However, the price (we spent $28 for 16 dumplings) wasn't really worth it. I would definitely recommend visiting if you're not familiar with this place, but otherwise I wouldn't say it's a must-go.",1
"Came here for lunch special.We got bbq short ribs combo $24.99And oyster tofu soup $14.99Also curry tofu soup $12.99As all korean restaurant, you got complimentary appetizer, and in here you got extra fried fish! Food was decent, with reasonable price.",0
"I visited this restaurant on a Monday night and found that it was pretty empty. I was able to get my food in 4 minutes and it tasted pretty good. The birria soup was especially flavorful. The only downside was that some of the soup spilled out of the container and onto the table, which made it a bit messy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The sushi was just not edible - it was mostly rice with small pieces of fish. The salad had some weird dressing on it and the lettuce looked like it had gone bad. The dumplings in a peanut sauce were also really disappointing - they tasted like watered down sauce. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Char Sue is a great spot for a casual night out with friends or family. The eclectic interior is tastefully decorated and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. The happy hour food options are top notch, with both good and small portions. The only downside is that the happy hour drinks are limited to beer and wine only.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The service was great and the ambiance was really cozy and inviting. The food was delicious and the prices were a bit high, but I think that's to be expected in Tribeca. The four flowers mimosa was my favorite drink of the night and it was really refreshing. I would definitely come back and try some of the other menu items.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with the tapas at this restaurant. They were all average in taste and size, and the prices were quite high for what you get. The best dish was the gambas al ajillo, which was full of delicious garlic flavor. However, the rest of the tapas were good, but I've had better and cheaper at other restaurants. The paella was my favorite dish - it was full of seafood and was very saucy. The only downside was that it was quite expensive. However, it's definitely worth making a reservation in advance - the restaurant is quite cramped and it can be difficult to get a table.",1
"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had lunch and dined outdoors. I would have loved to dine indoors but this was during peak pandemic so we opted for the outdoor option. The restaurant is furnished and designed quite nicely, warm tones, deep greens, and I think gold or brass hardware? For food we ordered the little gem, bottarga spaghetti, truffle pizza, fries and brussels. The pasta is light and airy and has a hint of tartness from the bottarga. The truffle pizza was delicious as well. The little gem was also great and was recommended over the ceasar. Overall would recommend for a cute lunch or dinner. Next time I think I'd like to try their brunch! (They have donuts...)",0
"I was really looking forward to trying aRoqa, as it's one of the few Michelin-starred Indian restaurants in New York City. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. The flavors were underdeveloped and lacked depth, and the portions were quite small. The service was also clunky, and the servers didn't seem to understand the menu items. In addition, the space was quite elegant, but not very welcoming or cozy. I would recommend trying an authentic Indian restaurant in the East Village or Gramercy instead.",1
The only place in NYC I dont mind waiting for. The food is always really good and there are some decent cheap eats too! The breakfast to go specials are convenient and reasonably priced. The 24/7 factor also kills the game. Rotating seasonal pierogies is huge in my book. I got the blue plate lunch special which had matzo ball soup and 1/2 chicken salad sandwich for $12. Just the right amount of food and very good.,0
"Update- this place has really streamlined quality and service since first opening! The food is so so so good! Taking traditional Korean flavors and blending American (read NY) favorites for the perfect casual filling meal! Chopped cheese rice cakes was my favorite it reminded me of eating hamburger helper but wayyyyy better with better ingredients. Just has a nice homey feel to it! The burger was giving McDonald Big Mac if McDonalds had actual chefs preparing each burger made to order especially for you! Juicy, well seasoned, stacked, meaty! So good! Not to mention the ambiance! Great music for a lil pre turn up vibe or fun to impress a date with (they'll think your super cool, trussst me). Also affordable! Thanks Nowon!",0
"HALLE-FREAKING-LUJAH. There's finally a dim sum place close enough to my apartment so I no longer have to trek all the way to Chinatown (I'm lazy, sue me) or Flushing whenever I have a craving. Not only is the location v ideal, but the actual dim sum is v v v delish too. Having grown up eating dim sum once a month with my family, I can attest that Dim Sum Palace's Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), Shumai, Chicken Feet, Lo Bak Go (radish cake), etc. are just as good as the ones I always loved eating as a kid and now as an adult. The Mango Smoothies my boyfriend and I got were also so fresh and yummy too. The only dish that fell a little flat for me was the Xiao Long Bao, which was unfortunately just not flavored very well. Both the meat and the soup were pretty bland and just left so much to be desired. Aside from that, however, everything else was extremely tasty and will definitely be ordered again the next time I get that dim sum itch.",0
"I have to say I am pretty disappointed in Valbella. I went to the old location and I really liked it, so I wanted to bring my husband to the midtown location for him to try. We do a special date night in the city every year around the Holidays, so we really look forward to this night. Walking in, we were greeted by a VERY moody hostess. She seemed like she could care less being there and it set a negative tone for dinner. We started off with a drink and the eggplant appetizer. It was lightly fried and relatively not bad. We ordered another round of drinks with our entrees. My husband just got a titos on the rocks (which is his go-to so he knows what it's supposed to taste like), and they did not make it correctly. It tasted like they added club, and it took so long to get the drink that we decided not to send it back. My husband got the branzino and I got the pappardelle/short rib special. My dinner was amazing - cooked perfect and the homemade pasta was incredible. The branzino was subpar. Very small portion and the side was almost awkward. It was a cold tomato/cucumber/artichoke salad. It didn't pair well with the fish and almost felt like a cheap way to do a side vegetable. The check came and we were pretty surprised how pricey it was given that overall everything was just okay. On our way out, the hostess that was moody was sitting at the high top table on her phone eating dinner. I understand the staff needs to eat too, but it was very unprofessional for a restaurant that is supposed to be higher quality.",0
So good!! Definitely will come back. Would recommend booking a restaurant. Perfect atmosphere for date night or getting together with friends and having an actual conversation.,0
"I was really impressed with the burritos I ordered from this restaurant. They're definitely some of the best I've ever had. The Congo with carnitas was especially delicious - the meat was really flavorful and tender, with just the right amount of fat. The rice in the Congo was also really soft and the beans were almost fluffy, mixed with the juicy carnitas. The burrito wrapping skills here are really great - there was no way it was ever going to come apart, even though the tortilla was thin. Overall, I can't wait to try more of their menu!",1
"SO and I stop here every month but never thought of submitting a review until now.  The ramen is great during cold weather...we usually will order the classic and I'll get a side of their hot sauce.  Last weekend we just ordered a bunch of their sides along with a bottle of Nigori sake and a few bottles of the Kagua beer.Their pork gyoza is always solid...nicely fried with great pork filling!  The shrimp mayo is fresh and nicely dressed...biting into these is pleasing!  The karaage is hot, crispy and not overly seasoned...perfect with beer!  The agedashi tofu and the seaweed salad provide a nice contrast to the fried items.  Additionally, the edamame is fun to munch on throughout the meal.Bottom line, the service is fast, the food is satisfying and the prices are reasonable.",0
"Came to city after Burger Fi was closed for the second consecutive day . I wanted something Barbecue-ey so I ordered their Ribeye and a side a fries to wash it down . The Ribeye Sandwich comes with slaw and BBQ sauce . The burger felt like it was missing something . It tasted similar to a sloppy Joe with its shredded texture and was something  I would not have ordered had I known . I like more complexity in my Burger, and the amount of BBQ sauce was just too much and rather boring . The Ribeye was just a tiny, tiny smidge on the chewy side also but not bad but not all that . The fries ? Really disappointing . Some were crisp but most didn't taste fresh at all along with it being rather salty . No one in my family liked it especially without the help of ketchup . All in all it was a slightly favorable meal but not one I'll want to remember nor try again especially being in NY with so many other options .",0
"Planta Queen Nomad is a great place for plant-based food lovers. The drinks and appetizers are delicious, and the sushi is especially good. The service is excellent, and Larry is a great bartender who can recommend drinks and dishes perfectly. I highly recommend Planta Queen Nomad to anyone looking for a great vegan or vegetarian restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere was wonderful and the service was amazing. Our waitress was attentive but also able to take care of us when needed. The only downside was that the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, so it may have been harder for her to be as attentive as she could have been. The food was good overall, with some dishes being better than others. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get. I would definitely come here again!",1
"Based on what I read from Prince Street Pizza, if i write a review during this COVID-19 crisis, I should go to hell.  Hell yeah, I got a VIP spot down there.  All drama aside, I did have a good experience at Prince Street Pizza a few months back.  Lined up for 45 minutes and we shared 1 slide of perfect pizza, pizza parlor style.  I am also on a low carb for the past 20 years, one more strike on me.  The wait is absolutely part of the fun.  I encourage everyone to check out this spot.  Especially during the crisis, let's support these local spots.",0
"Came here for lunch on a weekend. The place was super packed both outdoor and indoor but they could seat us by the bar so we opted for seating there. The service was friendly and there were alot of food options (very egg heavy). They gave us muffins for the table which I thought was such a special touch. But, once we were seated at the table - it took a very long time to get silverware, napkins, water etc. (in fact we didn't get those until we had placed the order for the food and the food came out). The service was a little slower than I had hoped for given we were seated at the bar. The food was pretty good, french toast was sweet and decadent but not too overwhelming. The eggs and bacon was a huge dish and definitely satisfying for appetite. Overall - the portions were great and the muffins were a nice touch but the quality of the food was okay. I think the service could've been a bit more attentive though. The other thing that really bothered me was that at the bar seating, we could smell the clothes that were at the other side of the bar so that definitely impacted the overall experience quite a bit.",0
"The expire experience is amazing! We get there around 1:30 and only waited for 30 minutes. While you are waiting here, you can order cocktails to kill time. Also they provided menu at the waiting area so u can do your research for the noodles u want to order later. Walk in to the dining area, they don't have a lot tables and the design are simple, u can hear all the waiters will greet u with Japanese. Love it. Feel special lol After we get seated, water, menu, everything's set. I ordered noodle and also their yuzu martini. The drink is sooo good, very fresh, and the noodle is amazing. The service is good, they are friendly and efficient. I heard someone will say that the waiters will try to push u to leave then they can service the next customer, but we stayed like 20 minutes. And they didn't cake to ask us if we want to check. I love it. The price is not high and the quality, the service is really good! !",0
"Was craving sandwiches one evening so we ordered these since they were nearby! These sandwiches are HUGE and HEAAAVY. 1/2 a sandwich will pretty much knock you out (especially if you're having a salad or a soup on the side)Caprese Sandwich- a classic caprese sandwich, fulllllll of pesto, which I did not really likeIll Papa Sandwich- reminds me of a classic Italian sandwich. A perfect balance!Spicy Salami Sandwich- omg. This sandwich iS AMAZING BUT... gave me acid reflux... I want to say the sauce was too greasy or the salami was too spicy but it definitely burned a few hours after I ate the sandwich. I finished the other half slowllyyyyyyyy and in moderation haha. Overall, it was pretty good, I would go back because it's like the only sandwich place within walking distance",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch today and I have to say, it was a pretty good experience. The food was delicious and the presentation was really pretty. The only downside was that the table fan fell off our table, but other than that it was a good experience. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"The food was generally good, but I felt a bit ill after eating at this restaurant and would not recommend it.",1
"The hype must have died down because I ate at Chloe peacefully.Been couple of years since I've had Chloe in Soho, the original location. Food was delicious but eating there was just so crazy, felt like a mad house inside looking for a place to sit that I haven't had it ever since. We got a light meal and just shared their famous quinoa salad with their lemonade.  The quinoa salad was refreshing and addictive as I remembered and the lemonade was very unique and refreshingly good! It wasn't your typical lemonade and had minty cucumber flavor that we wanted to order more of it. Compared to the Soho location, this place had more open space and not sure if it was early for dinner, but pretty empty that we loved it.  This place is perfect for everyone with little coloring books and crayons to entertain the kids and healthy meal options for the family, as well as instagrammable food for the younger generation.The only thing I would say they would need to improve is keeping the tables clean and having our food come out faster.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The room was quiet and comfortable, and the service was attentive and helpful. The Scotch Egg and Sazerac were good enough to make me want to return. The Fish & Chips and Brined Chicken were also quite good.",1
"Been here a few times and have always enjoyed the memories. Love their service and also their fries. Always so fresh and tasty, I could eat loads! Also love their chicken wings although on this visit I got the chicken fingers for the kids instead. Plenty of drinks and good on offer. There is an outdoor sitting area that is open now.",0
"I came here with a group of vegetarian friends after seeing Buzzfeed's ""Worth It."" I had also gone to Avant Garden, and liked both of these restaurants for different reasons.

It was (rightfully) crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but we were able to get a reservation and were seated after about a 10 minute wait.

The whole atmosphere here is really great. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and the other staff was really friendly to us. We each got a mixture of things, but my favorite was the macaroni and ""cheese"". It was really flavorful and had a good consistency, unlike some of the other cashew cheeses that I have had, that are more grainy. My friends tried the Po' Boy with  crawfish"" and ""shrimp"" (and the consensus was that the ""shrimp"" version was better).

Overall, would recommend for a vegetarian dinner option. Bonus points if you go to Levain on 116th and Frederick Douglass (10 minute walk) afterwards!",1
"We came here on Saturday before a show at Gotham comedy club. We made reservations since we had a large group but it was pretty empty at 6:30 pm. They had happy hour from 5-7 with discounted drinks. We got the grape, strawberry, peach soju and a couple beers.For apps we got the chicken wings with soy garlic, japchae, calamari, pork mandoo. The japchae was one of my favorites, really enjoyed the wings and calamari too. The pork mandoo was standard. For main course we got the kimchi fried rice (veggie), chicken teriyaki, spicy pork, bulgogi with rice and pork belly. The chicken teriyaki was a little too sweet for some people but personally I loved it. The kimchi fried rice was excellent. The spicy pork was a huge hit, pork belly very good and bulgogi was okay. Overall we really liked the food, atmosphere and our waitress was excellent!",0
"I had a great time at Rosa's when I visited for dinner last week. The walk-in policy was nice, and the staff was welcoming and accommodating. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant participates in Restaurant Week, as I was able to try a few of the menu items that I hadn't had before. The shrimp cocktail was especially good, and I really enjoyed the relleno as well. The only downside was that my rice was a bit grainy, but that's really no biggie. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Rosa's and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in a fun and lively atmosphere.",1
"I visited this restaurant and was impressed by their safety protocol. I also had no complaints there. The food was good, but it didn't hit that sweet spot for me. It didn't satisfy my craving for some spicy and savory noodles. The beef noodles soup was really good, though. The beef was really tender. Everything else; the dandan noodles, chili oil dumplings and the spicy sour vermicelli noodles were just okay. They didn't have that kick of flavor and spice that sichuan food usually have. Honestly, I would not order these items again, but I would definitely come back for the beef noodle soup.",1
"This restaurant is located on a busy street corner which I personally didn't mind-- despite sitting outside, the noise level wasn't bad. One critique was that the outdoor chairs were particularly uncomfortable. With that said, our waitress was exceptionally kind and helpful, snd the food was generally acceptable. The burgers were greasy (nothing special), but the kale salad was quite good. I'd say the salmon was a touch undercooked. You have to get the cast iron cookie if you eat here.. its easily the best thing on the menu!",0
"Bobwhite Counter is a great place to go for southern comfort food. The interior is set up for the ease of takeout orders to go smoothly, and my favorite dish at Bobwhite's is the catfish sando. The chicken, pickles, and ranch biscuit is also delicious, and the buffalo biscuit was a great addition to the menu. The fries were a bit disappointing though - they were seasoned well but too way soft. They lacked crispy crunch and were fairly mushy.",1
"Bubba Gump Shrimp is a restaurant that is dedicated to Forest & Bubba, the movie that was released in 1994. The restaurant is located in Times Square and has a view that is simply breathtaking. The cleanliness of the restaurant could use some improvement, but the food is definitely worth trying. The shrimp is the star of the show and is a must-have dish. The salmon is also a good option, but it could be more flavourful. Overall, the restaurant is a great place to visit for a romantic dinner or just to enjoy a beautiful view.",1
"I visited this Taiwanese American restaurant for dinner and it was a lot of fun. The flavoring reminded me a lot of Win Son in Brooklyn, where both places take a new spin on household snacks and dishes that all Taiwanese grow up knowing and loving. The dinner dishes that we would recommend are 1) Sausage party and 2) Crispy silken tofu as starters. Skip the oyster omelette, it was drenched in so much sauce that we can barely taste the omelette itself.

For entrees, the two of us shared the Water spinach and shrimp paste and Hsinchu Mifen. Both reminded us of home! The brunch menu looks interesting, will return for that!",1
"This is my second favorite thai restaurant in all of NYC. Food: I have been coming here since 2018. It's a great place for vegetarians as they have tofu, veggie, and mock dock options. The food here is well spiced and made to taste. They've also made an effort to cater to my mom who is allergic to onions and garlic. Everything is made to order and the vegetables are fresh. The spring rolls don't feel too oily and are crispy. The Pad Kea Mao is really good here. I like that the noodles don't  stick to each other and they make it really spicy for me, which I love. Up Thai is one of the few places I was able to find the Kao Soy entree. I love the tartness of the red apple and the curry is delicious. The size of the noodles are also exactly what you'd want in a soup noodle dish. The portions are the right size so you don't feel hungry or overstuffed.  Ambiance: The decoration is beautiful and welcoming. You feel like you're inside a fancy twinkle garden. The tables are pretty well packed so it does get a bit tight. Their outside seating is also really nice. They have created a summer garden look and it's so inviting that even if you're walking by you'll stop to look at the restaurant.  Delivery: I've also gotten delivery from here and they make an effort to package everything in a way so that it doesn't spill and is still hot. The food holds well to go.",0
"Overall, the food was great - especially the Thai dishes. Unfortunately, the service was not so great. We were not able to order our food sooner because the hosts were so overwhelmed and our waiter was not very accommodating. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was very cute though.",1
"My boyfriend and I came in on a Monday night around 6:30pm and were seated immediately. This place is very unique, since I've never had a mala dry pot before! I ordered a bowl with sliced eye of round, lotus root, wood ear mushroom, and mustard greens and got my dish spicy. My boyfriend ordered pork, frog, fish fillet, and bok choy. We left the restaurant extremelyyy stuffed! I think we made the mistake of ordering individual 4 ingredient bowls, when we really should've ordered one 6-7 ingredient bowl to share. That would've also saved us some money. The portions here are huge! The quality of the food is great, but the dish was a bit too salty for my taste. I had to keep pairing my dry pot with rice which made me even fuller. Overall, this place is worth a visit but be prepared to spend a bit of money.",0
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The staff was super friendly and the drinks were really good. I really loved the chopped salad, it was so good! The combo platter was also a good choice if you want to try a variety of items. The falafel on it was really good, and I'm definitely going to come back here!",1
As always no complaints. Food came in a timely matter. This places was packed event at 1 in the AM. We had:Nachos with chicken (These are really good)CUBANOBurger with bacon and fries ( I love their burgers but didn't have it this time)Cheesecake Cocktail :Coppelia Smash,0
Love their noodles. Very chewy. Actually all of their products taste good. I take off one star cuz they would do a trick on ur check. They add a 15% tip already but would staple to hide that. Then for those for who didn't know this trick would double tip. I really hate this kind of thing. Feels like lying to your face,0
The Leopard at des Artistes is definitely in a decline. The food was unfortunately bland and the prices are astronomical. The best part of our meal was our wine that we brought ourselves. We would not recommend this restaurant.,1
"I had a great time at Uncle Lou today! The food was delicious, and the service was great. I especially loved the crispy orange beef. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"This place is 5 STARS FASHO! I came here for my birthday and the creamy kimchi udon is to die for. Literally I could take a bath in that sauce. Ambience is fun in an underground basement type vibe with twinkly lights. The izakaya mew roll was also delicious. Frozen beer was cool, but not for me.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The salmon tacos were delicious, and they were served with a lot of sauce. The atmosphere is really nice and not too noisy, and the free chips and salsa were great. I'll definitely be back to try some of their margaritas!",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The things I least enjoyed were the Beef Kubeh I ordered, but the chicken broth was flavorful and found the kubeh itself to be a bit flat and uneventful. The flavors were all around excellent for everything else, though. I ordered some mushroom special, seared halloumi with honey (I can eat this exclusively and be happy for days), labneh and fresh pita. I also managed to sample their baklava. I would highly recommend their saffron ice cream. I will come back for sure and sample other types of kubeh meat and sample the other broths (a friend ordered a plumper looking lamb Kubeh in beet broth and highly recommended).",1
"I made a rsvp for ""greenhouse"" but I wish I could have changed it to indoor seating. It was still kind of cold. The food was okay.",0
"Are you calculating how long it will take you to get from Brooklyn to uptown Manhattan and realizing that Game 2 of Raptors-Warriors will be over by the time you get back? I was in such a jam, so I took out my phone and started watching the game on a street corner with YouTubeTV app and ""Dre Beats"" headphones. Unfortunately, God had other ideas, and it started raining like crazy. While under a canopy at Grand Hyatt, a soon-to-be-demolished Trump era relic that will not be missed, I yelped the Stout and RAN in my Metta World Peace hoodie.Stout has a lot going for it: tons of TVs (tho no in-game audio), sockets for your phone and computer, and a really nice and chill staff. The food, though? Hit or miss. Fries were pretty cold and had clearly been sitting out for some time. Burger was a bit better, but P2P (price to portions) is flirting with unacceptable. Patty felt like a quarter pounder. Burger combinations could be more inspiring. Most are blue cheese with standard optional toppings. Crowd is subdued and more sparse than you'd think: can sometimes be good if you've had a hard time getting seats during a Super Bowl, but there's less ""theater"" surrounding you.In all, Stout's a reliable place to get some food and watch a game, but just put the expectations on the latter, not the former.",0
"Eh. Margherita Pizza was good I guess. Kale Caesar salad was decent. Table bread was dry and tasteless. Mussels in wine and garlic sauce was sub par.We asked for anchovies on the side. Charged us an extra $3.  We asked for extra pizza sauce in the pizza. Instead she gave us marinara sauce in the side. For $5!Had to hail the waitress every single time...  to order, to ask for the extras, for water, for the bill.  Never got a second glass of water by the way.  And she walked by quickly a few times and we saw she was eyeballing our table and my empty glass. Tried to hail her again. To no avail this time. Poor service and just okay food.  Wouldn't return.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The chicken with chili oil is probably some of the best I've had in the city, and it's available in a fast casual environment which is great. I also really enjoyed the cold skin noodles or liang pi, which was a little different than what I'm used to. The saucy noodles were really addictive, and the tomato flavor was a nice touch. The beef noodle soup was also decent, but nothing to write home about. I would definitely return for just the cold skin noodles and chicken, but I'd also love to try some other menu items.",1
"Wolfgang's Steakhouse is a great option for those looking for a good meal without having to spend a lot of money. The steak is delicious and well-seasoned, and the prices are reasonable. The only downside is that some of the wines are a bit overpriced, but this is to be expected at a restaurant of this caliber. Overall, I highly recommend Wolfgang's Steakhouse.",1
"This place is really small inside which I usually take as a good sign, it wasnt. The food was decent, but my chicken tikka Masala was just chicken and sauce, for the price I would have thought it would have a little more. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I'd try some other places before going back.",0
"I ordered the lemongrass porkchop vermicelli and couldn't have been more please! They did an amazing job balancing all of the flavors and textures, and the dish still felt incredibly light! I forgot to snap pics of the drinks, but they have some AMAZING and refreshing beverages -- passionfruit excellence was a fan fav in my group!Also (not pictured) were the deep fried spring rolls that were also perfectly light and crispy. The food and drinks definitely rocked my socks.The ONLY only reason I can't give it a 5/5 was because we asked to sit at a table on the right side of the restaurant (it looked nicer and was more distanced from the other diners), but the hostess/waitress said that they had already cleaned those tables and wouldn't be seating anyone there anymore. Not 10 minutes later, two new groups were seated over there...I'll most likely come back, though, if I'm ever in the area. Fingers crossed they won't be weird about seating!",0
I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
"It was our first indoor dining back this year. I have to say the service is great. They are understaffed, but they are polite and professional.To be honest, the foods were mediocre. My friend and I were disappointed. Jjambong tang was good and drinks were cold and fresh. But the bbq skewered chicken was undercooked. They brought us another one, but we didn't find it tasty. Also, the pork in the spicy pork over rice had a an unpleasant odor. It was definitely the pork. I would say the ambiance is nice. Cozy and decorated with white christmas lights.",0
"I got the plant-based fried chicken sandwich made vegan (no mayo) which was pretty solid, though I'd love if they had other vegan options on the menu. Apparently they used to have a falafel burger which would've been great too. I'd love to see more plant-based options! Great bartender and vibe",0
"Pizza is pretty good and portions are huge (I got a grandmas pizza and it was enough to feed me for the week!) but the online ordering is clunky and the service is not so great.. I made an online pickup order through Yelp and it took a while for the restaurant to confirm my order. Since I live pretty close to the restaurant, I decided to just take my chances and show up to the restaurant and wait for my order. I did call the restaurant before to see if they got my order but the person who picked up the phone was very curt and unfriendly. -1 for customer service.. Luckily, when I arrived, the pizza was ready (not sure why I never got a notification saying that it was ready - I suspect if I didn't come and check in person, my food would have just been sitting in the back). The man at the cash register looked unhappy and looked irritated when I told him I was there to pick up my order (maybe the same guy I spoke to on the phone?) Despite the lackluster service and ordering process, the pizza was really good! Probably on my top three list of pizza in NYC for square shaped pizza. Slices were all evenly cut and leftovers tasted great throughout the week. Skip the garlic knots though - it is inexpensive (2 for .50) but there wasn't anything noteworthy about them. I probably wouldn't order online again, but I will definitely come back for some take out.",0
"The music he is popping; old R&B with hip hop and current music. The food was okay. I could not eat a lot of it because of the pork that was in most dishes, even soup dumpling. For myself,​ I ordered the lamb sausage (merguez) which tasted really good, full of flavor but extremely oily and very heavy. I had to have a cup of tea when I got home because of the grease. It came with kimichi was good and also came with a heavy sauce under it. The dish is tasty but needs bread or a better side than corn and kimichi to help it digest. It is also a bit pricey, 3 pieces for 25 dollars. I tried the rice which was tasty but oily, so I stuck to one spoon. The big favorite of the night was the shrimp shumai and the alcoholic drinks. All in all this place is a nice spot.  It is very easy to have a good time here. Mera's Tip: Enjoy the music and some shumai.",0
"I had a great time at Clancey brunch! The waitstaff were very accommodating and the decor was cool and grungey - just the way I like it. The food was also really good, and the prices were very reasonable. I especially enjoyed the cocktails - they were really good. Overall, I would definitely recommend Clancey to anyone looking for a solid brunch experience in the Lower East Side.",1
"I had a slice of the Fresh Mozz ($4) and it was as big as my head! The crust was thin and extremely crispy, and it looked tantalizing, but it was dry and stringy like regular mozzarella. I was disappointed that it wasn't soft and melty like it looked to be. The line was long, but it moved fast.",1
"Not sure why this place only has 4 stars when it should have more! Located in the heart of the theater district with very fairly priced items, The Melt Shop is perfect when you need to grab a bite after a show. My best friend and I came here right after watching a taping for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and we were STARVING. Although there aren't any halal meat options, the regular grilled cheese was amazing and we had the option to add more cheeses of our choice. The grilled cheese was the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't too hot or too cold, but rather the ideal warm temperature needed to dig right in. We ordered Parmesan fries with melted cheese on the side and wow those fries really hit the spot. They were crisp, fresh, and the cheese added a burst of flavor unlike what we're so used to at McDonald's. We also got a bottle of lemonade which completed our meal. The indoor seating was also nice and spacious. We weren't concerned about being too close to people due to COVID. Please check this place out!",0
"I swear I blinked and these multiplied. When the heck did they get so many locations....but whooo hooooo more locations with this magical kitchen! My god their chicken is delicious. Ugh and the green sauce!!! I love sauce and theirs is quite delicious. Three friends split the matador combo and had a round of drinks....each paid 25. A steal for that juicy ness! Pio pio exemplifies ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Bravo!!",0
"I'm glad that the bar is able to operate during covid. The heated area was really great for the winter time! Good place for a date or to come with a group of friends Food: I ordered the margarita flatbread and the spinach dip! Spinach dip was great. Margarita pizza was just ok. Portion sizes are EXTREMELY small tho- so you would need a good amount of food to feel fullDrink: I ordered the margarita - which has a delicious kick to it! I also got the festivus mule, which was a bit underwhelming. The presentation fo the drinks is not great, but they are very strongAmbience: location is key! This place does not disappoint. Lovely views. Loved the rooftop seating! Nice coverage and warm for the winter time! Fun vibe! Service: service was fine! Nothing stood out",0
"I was super pleased with my meal from Two Wheels! This is a great addition to the neighborhood. As other reviewers have mentioned, they serve fresh dishes that are very tasty. I tried the chicken Vietnamese crepe and lemongrass chicken banh mi. The crepe is kind of like a taco and comes with your choice of protein, bean sprouts, mesclun lettuce and herbs like cilantro. The amount of chicken was generous and it was well flavored. The banh mi sandwich was even better than the crepe. The baguette was very fresh, the daikon radish and carrots were nicely pickled, the chicken was piled high. There was also mayo, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeños on the sandwich. I'd definitely order it again. I'll be back at Two Wheels and hope you check it out as well!",0
"I visited Wild for brunch as a vegan dining with a vegatarian, gluten-free eater and a flexitarian so this was a good option for everyone. We arrived around noon on a Saturday and the restaurant was not busy at all. I had the tofu scramble, which had a nice mix of vegetables in it and the smoked tofu was a nice variation from the usual turmeric style tofu scramble. The potatoes that came with it were delicious and even though I eat gluten, the toast was pretty good!  My dining companions enjoyed their huevos rancheros and the gluten-free person was really pleased to have the French toast. Service was fine, nothing remarkable either way. Overall this was a solid experience and I'd be happy to go back if I'm in another mixed group again",0
"Washington Square is a great place to get a pizza. The Sicilian and Caprese pizza we had was decent, but nothing spectacular. The only downside is that they don't have any inside dining, so you have to go outside if you want to eat.",1
"The food was pretty good, but the prices were a little high for my liking. The guac was $15 and I was like :/. The main course we got was the birria tacos and quesadillas, which were both good. The meat was flavorful and juicy, but what put me off a little bit was the loud music on both floors. My friend and I had to yell to talk to each other and it was a fun vibe but not if you want to talk. I wish they had music on only one floor. I don't think I would come back here.",1
"I visited empire steak house during winter NYC restaurant week. We made reservations for Sunday at 4pm but it wasn't busy. From the RW menu we got the filet mignon medallions, Canadian bacon, raw oysters (came with 4), tiramisu and cheese cake. Starting with my steak critique; so both my boyfriend and I like our steak medium rare. His steak came half medium rare / half medium, mine came medium / well done. I was very disappointed by the quality of the steak and it was hard to chew. Honestly I perhaps have been spoiled by porterhouses and dry aged steak but you would expect a steak restaurant to make a steak medium rare when a customer wants it. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were good. Broccoli was a bit salty but the mashed potatoes offset it. Dessert was subpar, my tiramisu was frozen and I tasted ice particles when I bit down. The cheesecake was alright, nothing special. I wouldn't recommend either. The service was excellent but there were not many servers. We had to wait a bit for the check. Will I come back? Maybe, but there's better steak houses out there.",0
Came here for their special Monday happy hour where they do dollar oysters and have a bunch of other discounted appetizers. The oysters were good but they may have been a ting bit old. I enjoyed the croquettes and the deviled eggs a lot. The truffle nuggets were a little odd and kind of dry so I wouldn't particularly recommend but they weren't awful. Will probably be back at some point to try a full meal here but would recommend for their happy hour deals because the prices are right!,0
"Love the ambience here! Lighting is pretty dim, but felt very intimate and welcoming. Small tables with some larger table set ups. Can be crowded and have a wait depending on how busy it is. Location was a bit hard to find - no clear signs and was tucked in between store fronts down a flight of stairs underground (reminds me of food shops in Japan). Food was good - it'd say this place has more of a general selection of Japanese food versus primarily being traditional tapas found at a izakaya. Great selection of alcohol drinks to choose from, a fun places to eat with friends or coworkers and socialize. Restrooms available and clean. Prices were reasonable and service was excellent.",0
"My FAVE Thai restaurant in the city!Super authentic cooking, amazing ambience. Red Curry- 10/10. everything was there and more! They put thick carrots in theirs which is unique compared to other restaurants, I liked it. And the curry was the right amount of thickness and flavor as well.Thai tea- absolutely delicious. doesn't taste like the fake powder packets you get at some places. And it comes in this super cute tall glass jar.I love that they do a weekday lunch special- soup/salad, app, and lunch entree for $14. I did the soup and egg roll as my appetizer- both I was very pleased with!I came another day for dinner and ordered some other noodle dish along with the Red curry again..but dont remember exactly what it was haha, just that we loved that just as much too!Environment/Vibes: gorgeous. love the royal look, the decor, the romantic lighting fixtures..the Buddha artwork, its all traditional yet modern looking which I appreciated.PRO TIP: go early to reserve your table! They don't take reservations or call-ahead unfortunately so it gets pretty packed! Plan to wait atleast 30 mins to be seated..but trust me, its worth it!Return? definitelyrecommend? for sure",0
"I finally broke my birria taco virginity today and I'm so glad I did! Casa Birria does not get as much attention as Birria Landia, but the food here was phenomenal. The woman working the truck was uber friendly and everything was inexpensive and filling.

The tacos were flavorful on their own, but together they were magnificent. I couldn't wait to dig-in, so I devoured everything at the little public seating area next to Shake Shack. Looking forward to trying the other menu items!",1
"So happy I got to visit this place again! We went on a Saturday at 10pm snd luckily we're able to grab a table that just opened up, otherwise the restaurant was still packed, even at 10 lol! This time around I tried... Asparagus 5/5: holy cow the sauce that it comes with is absolutely stellar! It's got a little kick to it. And the asparagus itself is cooked well. Easily one of my favorite dishes of the night Plantains 5/5: wow who knew that plantains with sriracha goat cheese would pair so nicely?! Sweet meets spicy. Another fave. 3.5/5 kimchi paella: my feelings from my first review still stand. Don't really taste the kimchi much but it's still a decent dish. 4/5 soft shell crab: crispy outside, juicy inside. Just wish they served it with a bit more wasabi ramoulade. There wasn't enough so we started using the sauce from the asparagus dish too lol! 4/5 lucky noodle: thick flat noodles, yummy sauce, just not the biggest fan of fennel lol 5/5 Truffle Mac and cheese: a fave amongst everyone at our table of six! Perfect amount of truffle flavor. Rich and creamy. 4/5 Korean popcorn chicken: not bad but definitely have had better Korean chicken! It wasn't as most as I would have liked it to be. Flavor was yummy though. 4/5 steak: love the feta grits, steak was tender, accompanied by a soy-garlic glaze that was actually nice and sweet. 3/5 duck confit empanadas: meh these were just okay. On the drier side. Wouldn't order again. 5/5 bread pudding: perfect ending!! One of the girls said it's one of the best she's had. You won't be disappointed.",0
"I've been curious to try this place for their notorious OMURICE for so long. This is probably their most known specialty dish and it comes with a soft runny egg omelette over rice that they cut open for you and pour savory demi glacé sauce over. The omurice was very fun and visually enticing, but the flavor of the rice and egg itself were just okay, nothing too extraordinary or amazing. I did really love the soft creamy texture of the eggs but I wasn't as mindblown as I expected to be by this dish. Definitely worth a try if you've never had Japanese omurice before though!Their ramen is just okay, nothing too special and there are plenty of other exceptional ramen spots in the city that I'd much rather go to. Overall a decent option in the city for omurice but wouldn't necessarily crave a re-visit and wouldn't recommend the ramen. Remember to check-in on Yelp for a free matcha pudding with red bean dessert! :)",0
"Townhouse Diner is a great place to get breakfast. The service was quick and friendly, and we didn't have to wait for a table. The corned beef hash was my favorite item on the menu - it was very soft and mushy, but I still enjoyed it. The price was a little higher than I was expecting, but I think it's worth it overall. Overall, I would definitely recommend this diner.",1
"Dutch Fred's is a great brunch spot, with delicious chicken and waffles and a variety of other options. The service was great, and the bathroom was spotless. I would definitely recommend it!",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at Candle 79! I came here to celebrate my 26th birthday, last month and was really happy with how amazing the food and service was. The menu hosts vegan takes of dishes from all over the world so there's something for everyone, and the staff were attentive and brought the dishes out in a timely fashion. I would definitely come back here!",1
"The food here is great, especially for vegetarians and vegans. I only wish the drinks were cheaper - or stronger for their price.",1
Gallow Green is a great place to grab a cocktail and catch up with friends. The rooftop is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a relaxing evening out.,1
Got the combination soft tofu soup! It's pretty delicious and their lunch deals are pretty worth it. They give you an entire quart (I got it to go) and a container of rice. They have pickled radishes in to-go containers as well. The staff were nice when I went. Good option for fast Korean food!,0
"Love their kimchi fries, pork Banh mi and lemongrass rice bowl! They never disappoint.",0
"We ordered grub hub.  It was late and cold, but it's not really their fault; what is their fault is the quality of food provided and I'd sooner go anywhere else. The best part was the Roti Canai appetizer and the pork dumplings were good but I pan fried them a little upon arrival and they were small like shumai The two dishes we got were subpar; the flat noodle dish always seems to lack the egg according to my gf and neither that nor the red curry was satisfying.   The curry was thin and really lacked anything I love about Thai food.",0
I have visited Wo Hop many times over the years and the food is always amazing! This visit was no exception!,0
"I ordered the small homemade 5pc steamed vegetable dumplings and the two braised pork belly buns for delivery.Food arrived on time but was cold, unfortunately.The vegetable dumplings were cooked perfectly. 5pc for $6.50 is a little steep. They were okay. But I wouldn't order them again.The pork belly buns were on the small side. The jalapeños had a nice spice. The red cabbage was scarce but fresh. There weren't toasted macadamia nuts with mine as it said on the menu. The shoyu ginger reduction came separately and it was outside the box. I just dipped everything in it lol. It's on the salty side which I don't mind but important for people to know. The pork belly itself was not very flavorful, surprisingly. For the size of them, $9.95 was not really worth it.Overall the food was okay. But I wouldn't order from here again. It's not for me.",0
"I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The seating is perfect for small groups, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was delicious, and I especially loved the Jamaican Jerk Chicken. I would definitely come back here, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and relaxing meal.",1
Miss Lily's is a great restaurant! The waiters are so cool and the clothing is amazing. The food is also great - the jerk chicken is my favorite dish and the fries are perfect. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.,1
"I absolutely loved Molly's! It's a super cute and cozy pub with amazing food and drinks. A perfect casual date night spot, especially in the winter. I love the colorful Christmas lights they hang year round that really give the place so much warmth.

We recently came here on a Friday night at 7 and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a booth inside. They are sticking strictly to the 25% capacity indoors, but they also had an awesome outdoor dining section with heaters (and Christmas lights!) They used to have sawdust all over the floor which was really cool, but I believe they got rid of it due to covid. The tables were clean and the silverware all came in sterilized bags, we felt very safe eating here. As for the food (pictured) we ordered the following:-

Reuben was spectacular, juicy corned beef with Russian dressing, along with some of the best fries I've ever had - steak cut and super crispy-

Burger with American was perfect, onion rings were even better-

Fish and chips are also great here

Service was wonderful, our waiter / bartender was super friendly. We ended the night with an Irish Coffee and couldn't have been happier. Highly recommend",1
"Wowzers! This was an amazing Italian restaurant! The service was prompt and courteous, and the food was great. The pumpkin tortellini and butternut squash ravioli were especially delicious. The chicken parmesan was also very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Ordered delivery and had a good experience. The Tavern Bacon & Cheddar Burger and grilled sea bass were excellent, and though it got kind of mushed in transit, the apple crumble was incredible. Obviously it's not the same as dining in, but I'll take it!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant on my first time visit! The service was great and I loved the atmosphere. The food was also good. I especially enjoyed the crab cake and seafood paella. The only downside was the dessert. It was very sweet and I didn't enjoy it as much as the other dishes. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I'm looking forward to returning soon.",1
"I came here for my friend's birthday on a Friday night with a group of 5 people. We ordered the seafood pancake, the fried chicken wings (sweet and spicy sauce), the bulgogi kimchi French fries, the LA kalbi (comes with kimchi jjigae and rice), and the spicy squid rice. They also gave us complimentary dumplings which was nice. The portions were larger than I expected especially the bulgogi kimchi French fries. My favorite dishes were the fried chicken wings and the seafood pancake. The chicken wings were large, juicy, and the sauce had a good kick to it. The seafood pancake had a lot of seafood and was very crispy. The bulgogi kimchi French fries were tasty too since there was a lot of bulgogi. Service was fast and friendly. They didn't rush us like how it is in other restaurants in Koreatown. I would come back to try other dishes.",0
The food here was ok. I ordered the pollo ala brasa along with the white rice and beans. I also ordered a cup of chicken soup. The chicken was cooked okay but I wish it had a little more flavor a little more seasoning to it the skin wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. The white rice was cooked properly the beans seem to lack some flavor. The chicken soup was absolutely amazing and I would definitely order that again I'm very hearty and light at the same time. The soup was perfectly balanced.I recommend this as a solid place if you're in a rush looking for a quick cheap meal something to hold down an appetite I would definitely come here for a quick cheap meal.,0
"*HIGHLY RECOMMEND*4.5/5 starsFirst of all, I was attracted to this restaurant due to the decor and aesthetics. I love the hanging lights and the vibe of the place. It was interesting that this place offers a mix of Asian/Vietnamese/Thai cuisine. The items on their menu include both classic dishes you would see elsewhere, and unique twist to those classic dishes. There was so many options to choose from, but one thing for sure, the food here is really good! *DINNER*Tom Yum Soup - I love this soup so much. It has such a strong lemongrass sourness (I LOVE sour) with a kick of spice. Definitely worth splitting among 2/3 others. Spare Ribs on Sugar Cane Skewer- the meat was tender and seasoned pretty well. The sugar cane was quite juicy. However, the ratio of meat to sugar cane is a bit low, so you don't get that much meat. Crispy Duck Confit Red Curry - who would've though to make duck curry with pineapple and lychee in it. The duck was so tender that it pulled off from the bone real nicely. The lychee and pineapple did add a bit of sweetness to the curry, and the curry itself was not too spicy. This is one of my favorite dishes of the night.Pad Kee Mao - The crispy kale on top was definitely a unique ingredient added to this dish, and it tasted pretty good with the noodles. The noodles were soft but had a good chew. The chilies gave it a good kick of spice, so be warned if you cannot handle spice. *VERDICT*I would definitely go back again to try all their other unique dishes. I recommend all my friends to try this place.",0
"The carne asada was great!  Juicy and tender meat and delicious green sauce. A ""hidden"" gem in bustling Chelsea Market but judging by the number of reviews, not a secret to my fellow yelpers.",0
"Went here for Sunday brunch (best to make reservations in advance on the weekends). Ambiance and service was great. The food was delicious, but almost all items were slightly overpriced. Should have expected that in Tribeca. The four flowers mimosa tasted great, but could have been a bit stronger -- it tasted like mostly orange juice.Hopefully in the winter they will have heated/covered outdoor seating as it was a bit chilly and windy. I'd return to try other menu items, and because of the aesthetic!",0
"3.5 stars: the tamales are the real hit here (duh) and I especially recommend the chipotle chicken one. I've also tried the torta de quesillo, which was fine and fresh but sort of underwhelming. I'd definitely go back to continue trying more on the tamale menu but would recommend sticking to that.",0
"I was more impressed by their non-yakitori dishes, but it was good enough for 5 stars! Highly recommend their tofu with nori topping and the steamed egg. The tofu with nori is light, flavorful, and my favorite dish here. The steamed egg is infused with seafood and the broth the egg is cooked in had a wonderful crab flavor. Their yakitori dishes were good, but these were better!",0
This was hands down the best Chinese chicken I have ever had!!! I came here on a solo date because a friend suggested it to me. I orders the chicken and the pork chop and I didn't leave upset,0
"**shakes fist** why isn't this delicious place everywhere ? Why do you have to live up to the hype because I think of this place often !! It's a local nyc chain and there are so many throughout the city. It's a quick, service type of joint. You stand in line, order for to go or take a number and sit inside. There's a plethora of items to pick from I stuck to the originals. Noodles were nice and chewy. I got the mild so I wouldn't get the Sichuan hot pepper sweats. The meat was perfectly tender but not mushy. Flavors were a great balance. Worth the hype. Worth the wait.",0
"I finally got to try out this restaurant and it's definitely a fast-casual venue where you order at the counter and then grab a seat. It's interesting that they actually offer reservations! The seating itself is very barebones so I would recommend just grabbing a to-go as it's not the most comfortable unless you are just grabbing a very quick bite. They do have a basket of pre-wrapped rolls that you can grab for both dine-in and takeout - I actually prefer these to Hill Country's butter bread slices. Some updates:

1. Skip the spare ribs - they are super dry and not at all flavorful.

2. The brisket is still the best item here but make sure you ask for a moist cut as a lean cut can be very dry.

3. The broccoli salad is also solid: creamy and sweet with bacon bits and dried cranberries.",1
My daughter is self quarantined in a small( tiny?) apartment in NYC. Just her and the cat. She is thankfully able to work remotely but I knew she was tired of soup and beans and pasta so I researched pizza places near her. Vezzo was just the place. I did a no contact order and you can track them online.I was able to do the entire transaction via credit card including tip. I did have to make sure she had clothes on!! Lol. It was a surprise to her and she loved it. She loves thin and crispy crust and this hit the mark. She shared with the doorman ( using strict social distancing) because he keeps her safe and monitors her comings and goings. The pizza was delivered hot and fresh. She loved the mushroom side the most. So thanks Vezzo for helping me make my girls day a little brighter!,0
"Okay so with nearly 2000 reviews and a solid overall 4 stars as a rating, Cookshop definitely has a fan base. It's just one of those places everyone wants in for a weekend brunch.I've been here a couple times--only for brunch--including today and overall, it is a good spot that checks off a few boxes on a list. Vibrant atmosphere? CheckGood food and drinks? CheckAttentive service? CheckHopping neighborhood? Check--steps away from the Highline.I made reservations via Opentable 3 weeks ago and while I arrived earlier than my friend today by a few minutes, we were seated immediately once she arrived.My first visit a couple years ago, was brunch at the counter due to the long wait since we just walked in (also upon that visit, I tried their delicious cocktails and baked eggs).Today, my friend and I selected the frittata--it was a perfectly round fluffy omelet that included broccoli and feta cheese served with a small side salad. I ordered a cold brew iced coffee with my meal.Our waiter was super helpful and accommodating. We were pleased with the really good service.I enjoyed the frittata which hit all the right notes. The salad was a refreshing accompaniment.Was it the best frittata or brunch I've ever had? No. Why are some neighboring restaurants not as popular? Unsure.But Cookshop is the scratch off list and/or see & be seen business.  I do like it.And would return again perhaps for dinner. Solid. Just make sure to make reservations in advance for brunch or you'll wait",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and I have to say that it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The atmosphere was dark and I didn't enjoy it, but my vegan daughter loved it so that's something. The food was tasty but nothing to write home about. Overall, it was an okay experience.",1
What a great addition to the UES. We love that the cocktail menu is so different and delicious while the different ramen noodles are not vast but each well made. We ordered the shiso/ daikon and earl gray cocktail. My husband and I enjoyed both but were pretty bummed that the shiso cocktail came in such a small teacup. The whole concept is cute but you can finish the whole drink in like 3 sips. We got the Kyoto and Hokkaido ramen. My husband really enjoyed his Kyoto ramen saying the broth was great. I liked the Hokkaido ramen but personally thought that it tasted too strongly of corn. I love corn but it over powered the taste of the broth. The noodles in both dishes were a perfect texture and everything was put together perfectly.,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Downstairs Ramen restaurant and I was not disappointed! Upon descending the flight of stairs, I felt like I was leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind. The restaurant is lovely, and the vibe is welcoming and calming. I ordered the ramen burger, sweet potato fries and chicken skin. Man, oh man, that ramen burger was delish! The ramen noodle buns were crispy and held up well till the last bite. The ground angus beef patty was very juicy and topped with sweet teriyaki sauce. I literally inhaled this burger and wiped my plate clean! The sweet potato fries were a great complement to the burger. Perfectly fried, not too oily, slight sweet and crunchy. The yuzu tomato dipping sauce was perfect with the fries. The chicken skin grilled skewer was interesting. I mainly ordered this out of curiosity. I thought the chicken skin was nicely done but could do with some kind of dipping sauce. I imagine this would be fabulous with the ramen. The service was on pointe. The waitstaff were attentive and service was quick. The prices are very reasonable, and the food is delicious. I will definitely come again.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The margaritas are delicious, and the prices are great during happy hour. The bar area has a cool lounge vibe, and the seating is comfortable. I highly recommend stopping by for a drink or meal.",1
"TMI Note: I made a outdoor seating reservation for 7pm to catch-up with a friend, but in my sleep-deprived miscalculation, I showed up an hour early. The lovely ladies at the front offered to seat me early, but I elected to run a few errands before I returned at the proper time. 10/10 for service just for that + all the staff are above-and-beyond friendly.Outdoor seating is really nice with plenty of distance between tables and floral patterns decorating the ceiling in our little ""outdoor"" hut. Staff fashion was very interesting also--some with MIB-esque formal-wear and some with traditional Thai clothing.Had the Pa Kra Pao Gai Quail Egg, Som Tum, Pad See Ew with Roasted Duck + a few drinks.Som Tum: Basically a fruity, shredded salad which served as a refreshing starter. Our server recommended the chicken skewers (southern thai chicken?) to accompany this, but we opted to forgo for this time. It is a bit ""watery"" since the sauce/liquid pools at the bottom of the dish, but it was still quite good. Pa Kra Pao Gai Quail Egg: The lack of a larger fried egg was a tad disappointing, but the visual of the quail egg was really nice. Very tasty and very flavorful.Pad See Ew with Roasted Duck: As a seasoned See Ew simp, I loved this dish. Chewy noodles tossed in a flavorful, slightly pungent sauce. Absolutely delicious and the highlight of the meal.In summary, Sabai Thai is one of the best restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in recent memory. Perfect for a classy dinner with friends or for a romantic date night.",0
"Overall, I thought Emmett's was okay. The pizza was a bit bland and the staff was apologetic for the mix-up, but the other food that came out of the kitchen looked really good. I would come back here for a casual dinner, but I would not recommend it for a hot pizza.",1
"212 Hisae is a great place for a cheap night out! The cocktails are delicious and the atmosphere is fun and casual. The line can be long on a weekend night, but it's worth it if you're looking for a place to have some fun without breaking the bank. The fries are also delicious and perfect for pairing with the $3 shots. I can't wait to go back!",1
"My roommates and I found this on seamless and ordered every single thing on their menu because we love mozz sticks and all of their flavors sound amazing. While some of the combinations were unique, we found it pretty underwhelming. I think part of it was that the sticks didn't travel too well (I feel like mozz sticks, in general, don't deliver too well), but also the breading was pretty flavorless. Favorites among us were the original and goat cheese. Would love for them to open a store front to maybe try them freshFollow me on Instagram @eatenbysteph",0
"I visited 886.1 a few weeks ago and I have to say it was a really enjoyable experience. The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was really cool and neon. I especially loved the lighting. The only downside was that it was really crowded and I had to wait a long time to get our food. But once we got our food, it was all really good. I recommend the pork rice and the beef noodles. The chicken wings were also really good, but I would say they're a bit spicy. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and I would definitely come back.",1
"I've been here a couple of times for lunch as I work in the area. I'm a creature of habit in a lot of places and this place is no different. I order the same burger with bacon and cheese that I really do love. The burger is extremely juicy which isn't easy to do when I'm ordering a well done burger. The bacon has always come out crispy, it really is a good well balanced burger. I had to take a star off for how hard it was to get he ""waitresses"" attention throughout my meal. She stayed behind the bar most of the time so I'm assuming she is actually a bartender which I have no problem about but I noticed she stays behind the bar most of the time not just with me but with anyone who doesn't sit at the bar.",0
"All my friends who have gone to Thai Diner like their food but I can't seem to get the hype. The menu is creative and has the potential to be better executed IMO.2nd visit I tried the tom yum dumpling soup, scallop crudo, and massaman curry. Everything was super salty and lacked depth, especially the crudo which had passion fruit seeds but no passion fruit flavor. The soup was at least twice as salty as other tom yum soups and I had 6 glasses of water through dinner. Service was ok but felt impersonal.",0
"The food at this restaurant is pretty good, but the prices can be a bit high. For the amount you get, I think it would be better if it was around $13, but it's what it is. The jerk chicken and rice are definitely my favorites, but the chicken can be a bit dry. The collard greens and bbq chicken aren't that great. The mac and cheese and potatoes are also average. Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some good Caribbean food.",1
"Overall 5/5: Excellent. We stopped in for a quick bite and it was yummy. Food 5/5: we were on a mission to try xlb all in chinatown. these were solid! they were so yummy we got a few different ones to try and all had great wrapping on them and were filling. Thank you, Noodle Village!",0
"Flavor packed food! Came here for restaurant week lunch and really enjoyed my Hilib Ari (marinated goat and rice). On taste alone, the goat is extremely tender and flavorful. This was my first instance with goat, and I was thoroughly pleased (somewhat similar to lamb). I would definitely order this again. The rice was spiced as well, which added a lot to the overall dish. As part of the dish, we also had the chicken sambusas, which are crispy pockets of chicken and veggies (also very flavorful). On the side, we ordered Sabaayed, which is similar to naan, but much lighter, and a little more buttery. Some slight disappointments were (1) the coffee, which seemed weak, but heavy on ginger, and (2) the fact that we ordered for sit-down dining and were served on aluminum takeout containers. Those aside, the food was absolutely delicious, and I would definitely go back (hence the 5/5 overall rating). Price: 4/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 4/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 3/5",0
"Le Coucou is a great place to go for a special occasion. The atmosphere is classy and elegant, and the service is definitely up to par - if a bit pretentious at times. The food is also fantastic - especially the duck! All in all, a great experience.",1
"The food was good and service was great at this Shanghainese restaurant. I especially enjoyed the salted duck yolk fish filet, which was my favorite dish. The only downside was that the Xiao long baos were a little thicker than I would've liked, but overall I was satisfied with my meal. Plus, check-in on Yelp rewards diners with a free dessert, so it's definitely worth checking out!",1
"I came to this restaurant after not being here in years and it has undergone a renovation. It's now a bit more low-key and the seating is more like at a pub. The prices are cheaper than Gyu Kaku Japanese Steakhouse nearby, and there's a lot of meat on the menu. I especially liked the takoyaki and the Kobe platter for 2. The staff were very nice and provided everything we needed after the meal. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their daily specials.",1
"I had a great time at Douska. The hand rolls are good and the prices are reasonable, especially when you go for any of their combos. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great sushi and affordable prices.",1
"Two meals at Two Wheels and I can safely declare that they're already in my favorite restaurants list this year! I looooooooove the Deluxe Pho. The broth is amazing. The combination of brisket, steak, sirloin and meatballs are all delectable. And it all works out so wonderfully. And I'm not even a Pho person. The first time I tried it, I was already mentally calculating when can I come back to pick up another meal. It's that good. No kidding.Yesterday I was craving for it so bad that we finally just decided to order via Uber Eats. I just decided to add some extra noodles because their noodles aren't very generous (perhaps they can note this :) and do something about this) and extra broth. This time I had to finally try one of their banh mi so ordered the char grilled pork and it was chef's kiss delicious! The pork was grilled perfectly, seasoned well (reminds me of a grilled pork Filipino dish balancíng the saltiness and sweetness!) and the baguette was the star of the show. Honestly I feel they should start selling the baguettes. I'm definitely buying! :)I'm still looking forward to trying the Thai Iced Tea, Vietnamese Coffee, and all the other banh mi variants but for now I'm a very satisfied customer who plans to at least order once a week! Keep it up, Two Wheels! P.S. Also you owe me the loyalty stamp card. So let's sort that out shortly. ;)",0
"I had a great experience at this date spot in Koreatown! The bar, table, and booth seating is perfect for a variety of group sizes, and there are a variety of fancy small plates and some larger sharing dishes - you could even do a tasting menu if you wished. I tried the following:

crispy uni bites - not tasty and simply riding on the uni trend. There was zero uni taste and tasted a lot more like a weird gamey bone marrow flavor.

shrimp toast - this was a sesame seed crusted almost shrimp-cake patty in white bread. I enjoyed the contrast between the toasted bread and the tender shrimp pieces; I'd get it.

mussels in bone marrow broth - now this was a sleeper hit. The broth was clear but peppery, and reminded me very much of bak kut teh from Singapore. There were pieces of chewy and gelatinous tendons that I really enjoyed.

Pork belly - this was so yummy. Pork belly was tender and deeply braised in a caramelised dark soy sauce.

Truffle Mushroom bowl, added wagyu beef: now I didn't realize this was a rice bowl topped with",1
"A very reasonably priced Thai restaurant. Very nicely decorated and the seating layout is very open and nice. The service was really good. The waiter somehow gave just enough time to order and that was quite fascinating. The food came out with lighting speed also. The pink guava juice was good. The Thai iced lemon tea was absolutely tasty, different, refreshing and had a very special tone to it which I really enjoyed. The mango spicy wok stir fry had a kick to it and is not for those with a mild palate. The drunken noodles were very tasty. The portions were great and pricing was reasonable overall. The restroom was very clean and needs a special mention as they cared enough to even bring a special vibe in there. A great experience overall.",0
"The Dumpling Room is a small cozy room with wide wood planks on the ceiling, the walls and floor.  Chairs are metal in a variety of colors.  Tables are a 50's throwback with formica tops.  My weekday lunch was really good and that's saying something because I'm a tough critic, especially when it comes to Chinese food, my favorite cuisine.  Green beans arrived hot and blistered but still crisp and a bit salty which paired well with the moist rice and freshly made fried pork dumplings.  I'll go back to try more even though it's in a rather remote part of the UWS.",0
"I really wanted to try out this new place in my neighborhood, but despite the Americans with Disabilities Act being signed into law a full 30+ years before this business opened, their entrance is still not accessible as there is still a sizeable step that a wheelchair cannot pass.",0
"Before everything started shutting down indefinitely due to the circumstances at hand, I had really wanted to go see the RH Rooftop Restaurant so I did so on Monday. Yes, it was a lot emptier than what it would usually be but it was nice to see some other people around. First, I must say, the decor really is beautiful. I can imagine going here on a summer night and falling in love with this place. So why three stars instead of five? One reason is that there are no cocktails. Yes, no hard liquor and only three beer options. I get that this is a fancy place but this is also a bar... Second reason is the lobster roll. I read great reviews about it so was super excited to try it but unfortunately it had barely any lobster. The burrata and my friend's burger ended up being significantly better though (had to try some) so I wish I had ordered that instead but now I know! The service was wonderful too but I'm not sure if I would venture back because I'm not a big wine lover but this is a beautiful place worthy of a look.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and I was really pleased with the food. The Guac Burger was really good and I loved the spicy sauce. The Brussels sprouts were also good and cooked perfectly. Overall, a great lunch option.",1
"Avra was a wonderful restaurant for my mother-in-law's birthday dinner. The romantic Greek atmosphere was perfect, and the food was delicious. We all especially loved the Zucchini Chips and Grilled Octopus appetizers. For our main course, we all shared the Branzino and Fargi and let me tell you, it was absolutely superb. The fish was cooked to perfection and the quality was really high. The presentation of the plating was really cool. I also really enjoyed the chicken dish my son ordered. Overall, a great experience at Avra!",1
"Thought the noodle had good ""wok heat"" making it very tasty. The chicken pieces were cooked with a b it if seat, also very tasty. The noodle was fine. An overall good dishThe roti burrito wrap is tiny! From the images I thought it would be bigger  like a chipotle burrito or dos toros burrito. This is smaller. It was tasty with veggie crunch and peanut sauce. I wish the tortilla was warmed up or crispy via press, done something with it lol",0
"I walk past here and been wanting to try the new Indian place. I tend to stick to Curry Hill which is very close to where I live. A friend and I stopped for dinner. The decor is interesting and the service is nice. The menu is creative and interesting. We shared the pulled jackfruit tacos, genius move, may I say? We ended up with the classics: black dal and sago paneer with garlic naan and rice. The dal was spectacular - creamy and buttery. Even as I am writing the review, I want to go back!  It is a bit expensive though.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was attentive and the food was delicious. I got the pork set and it was really filling. The curry was really warming and I loved the texture of the rice. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good curry meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The drinks and service were great, and there were tons of seating. The food looked so appetizing, I have to figure out a way to come back!",1
I've been having some really bad dumplings lately. I think Vanessa's deserves an extra star from my previous review. The dumplings are consistently good and very tasty. I personally love their chicken and basil and pork and chive.,1
"Ordered delivery, Kayla wanted a good falafel. I got the Kale salad, and we also got fries and naturally, the cauliflower. Yo, the portions and consistency were pretty dope. Not gonna lie. The Cauli little oily, but tasty and filling. I would definitely go back for a hearty meal with some quality ingredients.The reason this is 4* is I feel they were so close to perfection- the dishes came out and were tasty, but the ratios seemed a bit off. Ever eaten a salad that had plenty of dressing, but was dry... or a sandwich that was super generous with the falafel, but you needed some more veggies in there to balance it out? That was how we felt walking away from here.",0
"I am very very confused as to how Set has 4 stars..... This may be the only time an overall Yelp rating has tricked me into trying out a restaurant..... The only reasons for my 2-star rating was the quick & friendly service, and affordable prices. The food and drinks are subpar, period. I went to Set with a few girlfriends for drinks & dinner after work on a Friday. We ordered the Set Loaded Tots & Tempura Shrimp poppers to share. The tots had wayyyy too many toppings & flavors going on (just didn't work well - sometimes less is more) and the shrimp was definitely straight out of the bag (comparable to the precooked frozen baby shrimps I buy from my local grocery store) topped with some sort of spicy mayo sauce; nothing special. We also each ordered one of their ""Sets"" as our meals. Each Set comes with one slider, one skewer, and waffle fries. Honestly, this wasn't anything to write home about either. My slider (beef) was extremely chewy, although my pork belly skewer was tasty. All in all, the place is a bit divey and the food is nothing to write home about. I don't think I will give a second try.",0
"I thought the food at this restaurant was way too overpriced and the ""natural"" juices seemed to be flooded in sugar. I used to love this place, but now I only go to the cachapas on Dyckman Street.",1
"I had a pretty negative experience at this restaurant. First, I walked in to the lobby and there was nobody there to greet me, so I had to walk to the back. I was then informed by the hostess to sit down, which I found strange. There was loud music playing in the background that wasn't appropriate for everyone, so it didn't make for a pleasant breakfast experience. I ordered the New Yorker bagel, which was basically just a bagel and lox. Unfortunately, the bagel was incredibly hard and I couldn't even bite into it. It was $19, so I wasn't all that thrilled to pay that much for something that wasn't very edible. The only good part was the rosemary potatoes. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant and I would give it a 2-star rating.",1
"Smith & Wollensky (interesting naming situation) provides an old timey steakhouse feel but with some great (but unusual) choices. The Cajun steak, priced at $76, is probably one of the best they have to offer and the flavors are a wonderful blend of decent steak and well balanced seasoning. The sides are the classic ones found at similar steakhouses and I have to recommend the potatoes and the spinach. I'd actually say the sides grab one's attention quite a bit!It would be difficult to ignore Smith & Wollensky as it is now one of the mainstays in the NYC steakhouse scene but one could find a similar quality cut at DeStefano's or Benjamin's. Or at least, one could have more space between the tables at those establishments, and that's my primary reason for 4 stars. I don't quite understand how the tables could be so close to each other, even before covid.",0
"I was a big fan of Jiang Diner (their old restaurant), which factors into my decision. On a visit for 4 we ordered the big plate chicken, sauteed beef with cumin, hand rolled noodles with mixed vegetables, and 2 lamb kidney skewers. They seemed a bit understaffed, so service was slow (1 hour to get all the food out despite 75% of the dining room being empty) but still very welcoming. The lamb kidneys were a bit overdone and smaller than we'd expect. The hand rolled noodles and cumin beef were cooked and flavored well. The big plate chicken was under seasoned. Portions were huge as usual - we left very full and still had lunch for 2 the next day.",0
"Note: Wednesdays [formerly] 25-cent wing special... now 44-cent wing special. BOO!PURCHASED: 10 wings ($4) + 1 brew (~$5)TOTAL: $9 CONS:- INCREASED PRICES: The wing-special price increased from 0.25 cents a wing to $0.44 cents a wing. Price hike history: Summer 2018 ($0.25 per wing on Wednesdays), by Summer 2019 ($0.44 per wing on Wednesdays) - Required purchase of brew: You are required to purchase a drink before the Wednesday 44-cent wing special is honored. - Orders in quantities of 5: You must order in quantities of 5. - Long wait: The wait can be as long as 60 minutes on a Wednesday. Though, you can come at 9pm to prevent the long wait. IMPRESSION:When compared to the other 3 weekday wing-special locations (please see below for a listing in NYC) this place has the best original wings (no sauce). Though it is beat by 10-cent wing spot on Tuesdays at another location. Best time to come is as soon as you can after work. Or, late at 8-9pm. It has been our experience that arriving during the aforementioned time will prevent you from waiting in a line that can last as long as 60+ minutes! OTHER WING SPECIAL LOCATIONS IN NYC: - Red Lion 10-cent wing special on Tuesdays (Bleecker St.) - Brother Jimmy's $20 all-you-can-eat and drink wings, ribs and brew; respectively (Midtown)- Professor Thom's Wednesdays 25-cent wing special (Michigan bar, edge of East Village) Note, I would have rated this 5 out of 5. However, this move in price has made me move my Wednesday Goldman Sach's crew to another location. This is now a ""Meh"" location.",0
"The Dumpling Room is a great little spot in the UWS with a rustic charm that is perfect for a quick lunch. The chairs are metal and the tables are a 50's throwback with formica tops. The green beans arrived hot and blistered but still crisp and a bit salty which paired well with the moist rice and freshly made fried pork dumplings. Overall, I had a really good lunch at the Dumpling Room and I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu.",1
"I visited this burger place for lunch and it was decent. There are only 6 bar stools here so it can get cramped during lunchtime. The staffs was accommodating and the food arrived quickly. The only downside is that the place is quite small and it can be quite difficult to get a seat. I think this place would be better suited for dinner than lunchtime. However, their weekly specials are worth checking out. Their curly fries are especially good.",1
"I used to really enjoy this restaurant, but lately the food has gone downhill. The margaritas are terrible now, and the food doesn't taste as good as it used to. I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.",1
"Gammeeok is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in NYC, and the best place to get seollongtang. I came with a party of five at around 5:30 PM, and we were really happy to see that there was no wait and we were seated immediately. I ordered the seollongtang deluxe this time - which had a bit more meat included and a bigger bowl! The seollongtang was pretty good - although I kept adding seasoning, it was still a little bland :( but I guess that's how seollongtang is! The meat cuts were not amazing, and were a little skimpy, but the flavor of the soup was still very good. Something I have always admired about gammeeok is how freshly cut the kimchi is - they literally cut it right in front of you! Best kimchi I have had in the US. We were also visited by the owners (I think?) a few times, and they always asked if we needed anything or needed refills of kimchi. Overall, a pretty great experience. I would recommend sticking to the regular seollongtang rather than the seollongtang deluxe, especially if it is your first time",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The chicken pad Thai was delicious - the noodles were cooked perfectly and there were so many different flavors. The pork basil was also really good - it was crispy and had a lot of flavor. The basil fried rice was also really good - it was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 3.5/5Overall: I'm pretty impressed with the food and I'm sure I'll be back.The extended review...Food:Insalatina - 4/5 - So I'm not totally a fan of arugula because of the bitterness but this was surprisingly refreshing for such a simple dish.Tagliatelle - 4/5 - The pasta tasted fresh and and had a rich and delicious flavor to it.  Service: 4/5 - Friendly and attentive service.Ambiance: 3.5/5 - It was slightly cramped but overall the spot had a cute look as if you were in a kitchen.,0
"I just came here for the first time and I really enjoyed my meal. The eggplant parm hero had a very nice authentic Italian flavor and was very fresh. I am surprised because this pizzeria is in the middle of China town, but I will be back. The soup and pizza looks and smells good.",1
"4 stars for the Uni Don, which was generously loaded with uni and perfectly seasoned rice, not to mention large, fresh cuts of salmon and tuna.",0
"Beautiful and clean interior, raving reviews, so decided to take a shot at ordering a small takeout snack for my partner's birthday, as he requested Japanese food. We ordered the small box of the Catch of the Bay ($23) which consists of 16 pieces cut: toro, lobster, truffle blue crab, and spicy scallop. For this price, I could've just gone to Hmart two blocks away for some sashimi, cut it myself, made some rice with it and it would've been hella more satisfying. Pretty disappointing. For the most part, the fish itself is quite fresh. Except the truffle blue crab, which was super fishy/weird/possibly gone bad. Idk. No truffle taste either. Pungent smell. The toro and the lobster were our favorites, but they were sooo itty bitty that I think I ate more scallions than anything. Now here's the part that completed ruined everything. The damn rice. RICE. How are you going to ruin rice?? You can already see from the pictures that the color is off. Mushy and didn't taste fresh. Maybe they had an off day, but when we walked in, we were the only ones there ordering food, so it wasn't like they were crazy overwhelmed that they couldn't have spent more time making sure the quality of the food is on par.",0
"I ordered takeout from here and was sadly disappointed. I was really looking forward to their vegan options. I got the rosemary garlic bread, the mushroomRoll, and the fun guy dumplings. The best of all three was the bread, so at least I'm happy I got that. The fun guys has way too much sauce on it and the mushroom rolll didn't have enough flavor.",1
"I had a really good time at this vegan restaurant. The atmosphere is really inviting and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the portobello strips and the sweet potato souffle. The only downside was that the portobello strips were a little dry and my sister's spinach was lukewarm at best. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great and the food was really good. I especially enjoyed the lobster roll. It was a bit pricey, but overall I would definitely recommend this place.",1
Came here after work with my friend last week - one of the less busy spots on stone street compared to the other taverns and restaurants. they don't have happy hour which is a bummer. drinks are alright. and the oysters were okay as well. pricy - $3 each. the service was friendly!,0
"Rossini's is a great old-school Italian restaurant located on the east side of Manhattan. The service was great, and the atmosphere was very comfortable. The beef barley soup was delicious, and the Ravioli Alla Vodka was a great addition to the meal. The only downside was that the restaurant wasn't as authentic as I would have liked, but overall I had a great experience.",1
"Food: The food is fairly standard American fare. I had the Havana Chicken dinner which was fine, though not super flavorful. My mom had quiche which was light and delicious!Atmosphere: THIS is what you come for. The singing waitstaff performs while you're eating which is a blast before a Broadway show. You do have to wait in line as they don't take reservations which can be upwards of an hour on a busy night. Service: Pretty good considering they're all dancing and singing while also serving.",0
"Updating for post covid world. Came back again this past Friday and it was a terrific experience. They have taken full advantage of their corner and have great outdoor seating set up with cover so you won't be in direct sun or light rain. There are a fair amount of tables  for 2 or 4, but all spaced reasonably so you won't feel unsafe despite lack of dividers. Staff maintain safe distance when conversing and wear masks. I tried their new sourdough olive pasta and it was phenomenal.",0
"Mei Jin is a great option for a quick and satisfying meal. The atmosphere is calm and inviting, and the service is attentive and friendly. The menu is easy to navigate and the servings are large, so you can easily share a dish if you're dining with friends. I especially enjoyed the broth, which was flavorful and hearty. I would definitely recommend Mei Jin to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.",1
"I was a little disappointed when I first arrived at this restaurant because yelp showed it as a small plates and tapas place, but once I ordered, all of those thoughts went away. We got and shared the falafel platter and the shrimp casserole and both were delicious and appropriately sized. Service was great. Super polite and punctual. Seating outside was great. Sheltered, ornate and still open air enough to feel like it makes sense amid a pandemic. I'd definitely return and recommend it.",1
"I've eaten here 5+ times since COVID started, so I can finally say that they're a solid late night eatery that has consistently good quality food. I've tried over half the menu at this rate, and the food has been delicious every time. The quality is very consistent and good, and it's one of those places where I can trust what I order is what I'll get and it'll taste the same every time. I've tried a ton of stuff at this point and I'm always happy with my choices.

The sliced beef is my favorite dish here, and it's always good. I love the fried tofu too, it's one of my favorite items on the menu. The fried squid tentacles are also delicious, and I always order them when I come here. The Takoyaki is a bit on the small side relative to the price, but it's good. I also like that it has a very crisp exterior.

The cold cut chicken is good if this is your type of thing. The peanut flavor is a wee bit strong for me, but I do like it. The fried popcorn chicken is standard and good. I do think they need to include lemon wedges to brighten the dish, because that's",1
"Peak dinner spot that is super low key and casual - perfect for a night out with friends! The service here is quick and efficient, however the pizzas typically take a little longer to come out. We got the vodka rigatoni and gnocchi to start, followed by a large tie dye pizza and the olive oil cake to finish. The pastas were delicious and fresh, and I really liked the texture of the gnocchi. The vodka rigatoni wasn't as creamy as I would have liked but it was still good nonetheless. The pizza was the star of the night - the vodka/tomato sauce, pesto, and fresh mozzarella paired incredibly well together with the crispy crust. I would highly recommend getting the tie dye pizza, it's one of the more unique types of pies you'll find in a city full of pizza. I've had a handful of olive oil cakes and this one was a little more of a bread/loaf than cake, so I would try a different desert next time. Overall, a fantastic spot and I cannot wait to return!",1
"I stopped into this place for happy hour and it was great! The drinks were affordable (especially for New York) and the bar staff was really friendly. I really enjoyed the margaritas - they weren't the best I've had, but they were still really good for the price. Plus, they gave me a bag of chips and salsa for free which was a nice touch.Overall, I thought this was a great place to go for happy hour. I definitely recommend checking it out!",1
This place is legit good and for a weekday it's super packed. Everything we ordered was delicious. I would come back here for the fun vibe and great food. Parking is hard. Just walk or Uber. Trust.,0
"I would not recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good Italian dining experience. The service was terrible and our food was not very good. I would give the Daniele pizza a 4/5, but the rigatoni just a 3/5.",1
"I overall like Indian Project and think it's a good option for Indian food in the midtown west area. Overall, if you're looking at typical Indian restaurants (outside of curry hill / queens), this probably ranks among average / good (although I did get a very nice family vibe from the servers who were there). A few things to take note --Reservation policy is a little unclear. We called ahead to inquire about the wait, and someone said we could come in 30 minutes and they'd have our table. When we got there, they said there was a mistake and they didn't take reservation (regardless, we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving)-Decor is super cute (lots of painted elephants, etc. on the walls). The vibe is kind of clubby (wouldn't describe it as wholesome / my first choice to bring my parents) and there is a huge bar with blue lighting in the back, so maybe this becomes a bar / club at night?-Food doesn't come with rice (a slight pet peeve), but the naan is very good! Got the veg korma and thought it was solid-Service is fine (a little slow), but the servers themselves are very sweetProbably would try a few other Indian places in the area before I came back, but would be equally happy to come back here and make it my weekly spot!",0
"It still hurts to see Chinatown businesses so empty when they were so vibrant pre-Covid; Noodle Village is an institution, and I've wanted to come here for a long time. I had my chance on a Friday afternoon, and I was sad to see that there was barely anyone eating there, though that certainly made eating indoors feel much safer. We had only parked our car for 30 more minutes, so this was perfect - we ordered the soup dumplings, a wonton noodle soup, and a beef brisket soup, and everything arrived within minutes. The pork and shrimp wontons were incredible - really juicy, tender shrimp and bursting with filling. They were light and really tasty, and the broth was also really comforting in its lightness. The egg noodles were thin and perfectly chewy. The HK style beef brisket soup had a tasty broth, too, though the beef was not as tender as I would have wanted. The soup dumplings were a pleasant surprise - pretty sizable with good broth and a very thin skin. I would definitely come back for a very satisfying, quick meal.",0
This food was not for me - not very authentic. I will never order from here again.,0
"The Thai dumplings and BBQ pork entree were both really good. The crispy skin on the pork was well done, and I loved the flavor. The siu mai-type dumpling was fine but nothing that spectacular. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!",1
"I think this place is way too over priced for the quality of the food. Every since they reopened the food tastes different and the ""natural"" juices seem to be flooded in sugar. I used to love this place but not exclusively go to the cachapas on Dyckman street.",0
Went here for a quick snack/drink with a friend around 7pm on a Thursday. We sat outside but it was pretty busy at this time both inside and out. I didn't go inside but from what I could see it looked beautiful & cozy like a perfect safe spot. Service was a little slow but it seemed like there was only 1 waitress for all the tables so she was doing her best. I started off with this pink gin drink (I can't remember the name) but it was so delicious & very strong. Tasted almost like a lychee martini. I then got the hummus & pita bread. It was a tiny plate of hummus for $8 but oh my god it was delicious. The pita bread was also cooked perfectly and just the right amount of dough. Wow I will definitely be back to try more of their menu.,0
"This is usually my family's go to when visiting the city. We always order the Matador Combo that comes with rotisserie chicken, salchipapas, salad, tostones, rice and beans. The food is delicious and comes out super quick! The wait usually isn't bad even for large parties and the service is always good. I took a star away because in the last two visits, the chicken looks slightly pink in areas like it wasn't cooked to its full potential and honestly for the price, the portions aren't great. Other than that, great quick Peruvian food if you're in the city.",0
"Restaurant Week takeout: huge portions!- Beef Bibimbap: good! Each veggie delivered: bean sprouts, marinated spinach, pickled radish strips, bamboo (I think), marinated cucumbers, lettuce. There was also a generous mound of beef, too. I should've more carefully measured out how much of the provided sauce I poured over because it ended up too spicy!- Galbi Jjim: less good. The marinade was overly sweet and the short ribs were either overcooked or undercooked because it was rather tough for a typically tender cut. I was also expecting chestnuts, dates, or radishes, but none were present. Sides/banchan included: - tofu stew in which the tofu disintegrated and benefited from rewarming but was comforting in the depths of winter- cabbage kimchi, radish strip kimchi, steamed broccoli.",0
"Emmett's is nestled just east of 6th Ave on MacDougal. We were greeted by a friendly staff member, Greg, who ushered us to our table while he chatted us up. We came here on a self-guided pizza tour so we ordered a 10"" deep dish meat lover with beers and wine for the wait. The wait seemed a bit longer than the standard 30 minutes for a deep-dish pizza. When our pie came out, it was, unfortunately, the wrong order and we ended up with the sausage classic. The staff was apologetic for the mix-up and bought us a round for incorrect order. We did not want to wait for the correct order so we ate the sausage classic (which was our second choice). The pizza was not as hot as we would have liked. The sauce was cold and the toppings were lukewarm. The cheese looked stringy when it was cut which made it look hot, but surprisingly it was not. The other food that came out of the kitchen looked really good, worth coming here to check it out for yourself.",0
I had a good time at this restaurant. The service was good and the prices were reasonable. My only complaint is that the menu is a bit on the expensive side. I would recommend trying out some of the specials during restaurant week.,1
"Fieldtrip is definitely worth the hype! The food is really delicious, and the service is great. I especially loved the bao buns, which were really unique and delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great and the servers were so much fun. I really enjoyed their energy. The seating is also great - it's outdoors and it feels very Parisian. The food wasn't my favorite, but other factors compensate for this. I especially loved the omelette with spinach and goat cheese. The fried chicken sandwich was just too fried for my taste. It didn't have much flavor, even though it was suppose to have a kick. The hash brown pancakes were also really fried, and didn't taste like anything but oil. However, the service was great and the atmosphere was lovely. I would definitely come back here.",1
"Ordered take-out from this sushi spot. It is located on a terrible block, sandwiched between several vacant, boarded up, graffitied storefronts. Don't let that deter you as this spot is a gem.I ordered various rolls to try them out and loved their unique offerings.American Dream Roll ($13) - rather than choose one fish, why not have them all? You get eel, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and shrimp tempura all in one massive roll, with tobiko, avocado, spicy mayo and sweet sauce. That is the American Dream.Spicy Tuna Pizza ($13) - This one was my favorite. A crunchy rice & nori crust topped w/ spicy tuna, shredded crab salad, tobiko, spicy mayo, and scallions. Essentially you combine a spicy tuna and crab roll with pizza. Can you imagine how great that must taste?UFO Roll ($9) - also consisted of multiple kinds of fish: salmon, tuna, yellowtail. It also includes avocado, scallions, tobiko. What makes this one unique is that instead of seaweed and rice, it is wrapped with daikon.Can't wait to come back to try their other creations!",0
"I had very high expectations from this place after checking out the ratings and reviews, but was disappointed. The service was extremely slow. We were sitting outside so the servers didn't really seem to pay us much attention. We had to wait 15 mins to get a glass of water. I always prioritize food over service while reviewing places on Yelp, and to your surprise, my 3-star rating is also based on the food. The presentation was great, but it wasn't backed by the flavors. Everything tasted pretty bland, quite unlike Mexican food I've had elsewhere. The chicken served with the quesadilla was dry, chewy. The birria tacos were super oily, even the broth lacked flavor. Maybe this is how they intended the flavors to be, but not the kind of flavors I would come back for.",0
"Oscar's was a great find for a fish and chips craving! The place was small and cozy, and the fish was cooked perfectly. The chips were also very crispy and seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a casual but delicious meal.",1
"I think I've found my neighborhood go to ramen spot!! We stopped by after a day out and was ready for some warm ramen. We were able to snag the last open table despite not having reservations. I started with the hot toddy which had star anise and yuzu, yum. Next we tried two of the rice cakes, unagi and beef. Both were delicious and beautifully presented but the eel was the better of the two. I decided to go with the classic tonkotsu ramen and it was perfection. Delicious broth, excellent egg, loved the thick bamboo shoots and wonderful noodles. Would've loved to try the shaved ice dessert if it wasn't the middle of winter lol. Nice outdoor setup, most seats are under a tent and heated. We were seated at one of 2 tables out in the open but there were heat lamps pointed at us.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and hearty bowl of ramen. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded so be prepared to wait a little bit.",1
"I had a great time at Kopitiam! The bek-kopi (5/5) was much less bitter than the Vietnamese iced coffee I'm used to, and the Milo toast was generous in size. The Hainanese chicken (5/5) was also very tender and juicy, and went well with the provided sauces. The cucumber was a nice palate cleanser from all the meat. However, I didn't love the chicken and rice combination as much as I thought I would. I think it might have been because the rice was a little bland. Overall, I had a great time at Kopitiam and would definitely come back!",1
This diner is nothing but hustle and bustle.  Not a place to relax and enjoy food.  You fill your stomach and leave.  I have been here a few times but their Reuben is delicious.  It really made me feel I was in NYC.  The place is small.  It gets packed and waiting is normal especially in the morning.,0
"Maybe the food is better in store, but after ordering takeout from here, I don't think I'll do it again (until I forget about this experience). An item that is extremely spicy, I'd hope that there was some semblance of spice. There is no spice, so much no spice that I went out to buy hot sauce. That's the only thing that made it edible.",0
"I went here with a group of 9 people for lunch, and indeed Rasa works well for large groups, whether the occasion is formal or less so.The menu is large, and you are likely to spend a few minutes figuring out what to order. Be like my friend and ask the waiter their recommendation, or be like me and trust your gut, and go with a lamb curry! It doesn't quite feel like an adventurous choice. Might even be ""basic"" as some would put it. But I certainly did not regret ordering what ended being a delicious curry. The lamb is well cooked and delicate, not too chewy/hard. The accompanying curry is really good too. However, it is a bit of an expensive dish at $20, especially considering it is lunchtime. The hot ginger tea here is a nice drink to have while eating. It is already sweetened, however, so do keep that in mind.",0
Tasty cocktails and brunch. I've come to this place for several years and the service is always good. They have great food and drink options and very tasty food and drinks.,0
"I really enjoyed my experience at Mala Dry Pot. The atmosphere is really unique and the food was fantastic. I especially loved the dry pot dish I ordered - it was very spicy and delicious. The only downside to the meal was the saltiness of the dish - it was a bit too much for my taste. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend Mala Dry Pot to anyone looking for a unique dining experience.",1
"12 Chairs is a great place for dogs and their owners! The menu is extensive and the portions are good. The Greek Omelette I got was delicious, and the Blueberry Pancakes were also delicious, much thicker than normal pancakes, but very filling and good. I would definitely come back to try more of their lunch dishes, the small plates and hummus looked amazing.",1
"Poketeria is a great place for poke bowls, but the upcharge for the Yellowtail cubes was a bit of a surprise. The smell of the fish was off-putting, and I would have preferred more feedback from the toppings stations. Despite that, the poke bowls are definitely worth trying out!",1
"Houston Hall is a great spot for large groups looking for a place to drink and eat HH-style. The food is good and the service is friendly. The only downside is that the place gets really crowded and noisy, making it difficult to have a conversation.",1
"Came here on a Friday night around 7:30 pm for dinner with a friend. There wasn't any table seating available but we found two spots at the bar. We started out with cocktails and wine then ordered the Roasted Cauliflower, Charred Halloumi, Sweet Potato Falafel and Pommes Frites. The Charred Halloumi was SOO good, it was seasoned with an apple chutney and pistachios. The cauliflower was also really well made. The ambiance of the restaurant was very cute with rustic decor and a marble bar, the crowd ranged from older patrons to NYU students; everyone seemed to be enjoying their drinks, food and company. It felt like there were a lot of regulars here, which is a good sign that people keep on coming back!",0
Havana Central is a great place to go for a Latin night out! The music is great and the mojitos are delicious. The service is also excellent. It's a great spot for a date or with friends.,1
"*Pretty good* Jian Bing (Chinese crepes) in NYCFood: It's quite hard to find good to decent Jian Bing in the U.S., not to mention in the NYC area without scouring Chinatown or spending an exorbitant amount of time researching holes in the wall that sell these Chinese crepes. This is a terrific location to have Jian Bing at a *fair price* when you take the location, manual work involved, & the fact that this is one of the few places to offer Jian Bing at a convenient, accessible location. Disclaimer: this of course is not the best Jian Bing you'll ever have so please do not compare. There are 3 different types of Jian Bing you can order as a 'base': signature (rec'd), you tiao (Chinese doughnut), or egg. Then you select the 'sauce': spicy, savory soybean sauce, or both (rec'd). Then add any extra toppings. We did spam (our favorite topping for everything and anything)! 1 order will fill one person up. They make it in front of you so that's cool too.Service: What you expect at a regular food court.Location: Inside the Food Gallery 32 of K-town in a food court style. No eating inside, so when you take this to eat elsewhere, it may get a bit soggy. There is limited seating outside.",0
"I've tried every seafood roll on the menu. The best was (surprisingly) the crab roll. Of all the seafood, the crab was by far the most fresh with most of its natural flavor preserved. The lobster roll was also pretty good, although you can taste it's been frozen and unfrozen again. The lobster meat was still very tender. I did not like the shrimp roll, I found it overly salty. Overall, I would say it's good for the price point (especially in NYC). The food is a bit on the salty and buttery side, to the point where it's overwhelming. The roll is extremely buttery, and they add lots of butter to the seafood too. For hours afterwards, I was extraordinarily thirsty and reaching for my glass of water. I would come back for the crab roll but as a whole, the food doesn't compare to fresh seafood you can get in Maine/New England.",0
"Probably a 3.8.Waiter was very friendly and good vibe.Zucchini Squash is more like smashed squash, not much flavor but just some spice sprinkle over the top. Odd dish.Mushroom was really good. Charred with delicious flavor.Trout - basic dish acceptable.Chicken - there's only chicken breast and I don't usually like chicken breast but it was not too dry so surprisingly.",0
"The Smith is a great place to go for a casual meal. The chips with blue cheese are amazing, and the Mac n cheese is also fantastic. The staff is very friendly and takes great care in handling the food, emphasizing safety. I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
I visited this sushi restaurant and everything was amazing! The fresh fish was cooked perfectly and the unique pairings were fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place to others.,1
"The food at this Korean restaurant was good, but the delivery time was slow. The staff was friendly and helpful, though. The only issue I had was that the tacos were very salty.",1
"Apparently they were in the middle of a menu switchover the night I arrived, and that's why they forgot to add in a few of our orders. However, everything I had was super delicious, and I have faith that the rest of their food will be tasty if they get their ish together a little better.I got the warm cauliflower, merguez spicy lamb sausage, and shirazi, a tomato and cucumber salad. The cauliflower was perfectly roasted, and had just a hint of lemon zest/juice, which was perfect. The cucumber salad was super refreshing and great for a warm summer evening. The merguez was nicely grilled and had charred bits.That amount of food was a decent starter for two, but I think another entree would have really rounded out the meal.",0
"I had the chance to visit District Social on a Friday evening while grabbing drinks with someone. I've been here several times before when it was a little quieter, but I didn't know what to expect for their happy hour crowd on a Friday evening. Let's just say I wasn't surprised...I walked in around 6 in the evening. The moment I walked in I realized that it would definitely take me more than a few minutes to order a drink. The bar was completely packed! Probably three layers of people deep, I sucked it up and waited to grab drinks for my friend and I before attempting to find seating.The space itself is actually pretty large. A big main bar area in the front is followed by dine in seating in the back half of the space. They also have a second floor where you're allowed to also enjoy drinks. They also have a private dinning room for large parties if you're looking to book something more intimate.Their happy hour is from 4 to 7 PM! They have a variety of draft craft beers, along with a modest wine selection. The crowd usually was at it's worst for the first two hours, but then died down during the last. I'd suggest staggering your visit if you're trying to come for their happy hour.Overall a decent spot in midtown west to grab drinks with friends! I'd definitely come to try their dine in menu, but if not you're guaranteed to find a bustling crowd and friendly waitstaff.",0
"Ramen Setagaya was not a great experience. The ramen was overcooked and had a weird texture, and the pork bun was just an Ok nothing to rave about. I would not recommend wasting a meal here.",1
"Ok so I've never been head over heels for Sophie's empanadas (I much prefer Empanada Mama) but today on a whim I made the decision to order a sandwich from here. Decided on the Pernil Sandwich With A Twist and OH MY GOODNESS! The flavor! The texture! The onions! That bread! The shredded pork! Do not miss ordering this sandwich because it's a mind blower! But allow me to go into more detail...The Pernil With a Twist ($11.49) has succulent chunks of roast pork--the kind you want to pick out, pull apart, and relish separately. Deeper in, among the tangy onion slivers and jalapeno-green sauce, there are homely fried lumps of sweet plantain golden nuggets that could bring a brown man to his knees. Quick Tip - You MUST order multiple sides of garlic sauce and green sauce. I could drink them as a soup. Huge bold rounded out spicy gorgeous sauces. All in all, WOW for this sandwich Sophie's!",0
"Came here with a bunch of girls for brunch and we put in our group order together!  The food was really good but all the brunch drink choices were super sugary and similar. Would be nice to have more options on drinks!  Surprisingly, best menu item we got was the quinoa bowl, it was different.",0
"The breakfast at this restaurant was pretty good. Nearly everything on the menu can be prepared gluten-free, which is a huge plus. The hostess ignored me upon entering, which was a bit confusing. The coffee was ridiculously bitter, and I couldn't drink it. The French toast was decent, and the ""berry compote"" was about 2-3 halved strawberries with a touch of a strawberry syrup. The side of syrup was not so necessary, as the strawberry syrup was enough on its own. The bacon came with 3 strips, but one strip was crisp and perfect while the other 2 strips were an underdone fatty mess. The avocado toast was a very generous portion, and the eggs were scrambled right. The restaurant as a whole seemed a touch understaffed, but the managers wearing suits stepped in to aid in clearing plates, setting tables and just kept the restaurant running. Great to see that kind of hustle. Longer wait than that, you'd best take advantage of the Yelp waitlist feature. Otherwise, pass.",1
"S Wan Cafe offers a delicious and affordable Hong Kong-styled cuisine in a clean and comfortable setting. I ordered curry fish ball rice noodles ($2.75), taro and chicken fried rice ($8), and eel spaghetti ($10.50). The rice noodles came in a large Chinese takeout soup container and were softer and more soup-like than the typical dim sum-like rice rolls. That said, the fish balls were still delectable. The taro and chicken fried rice sounds more interesting than it actually was; diced into small bits, the taste of each didn't stand out visually or flavor-wise. But it was still solid fried rice. Similarly, we weren't sure if the intriguing eel spaghetti would come with Chinese-styled noodles or truly Italian-styled pasta. It was the latter, with a tomato ketchup-based sauce. This might sound weird, but ketchup is used quite a bit in Hong Kong-styled cuisine (I've seen some sources that ketchup actually originates from Southeast Asian fish sauces and may derive from the Cantonese word ke-jiap or the Chinese Hokkien word ke-tsiap).



I wish I had heeded the advice of a fellow",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Sophie's Cuban Cusine! The staff was so friendly and my order was handled quickly. The lemonade was fresh and delicious, and the Cubano was really good - definitely authentic Cuban! The empanada was also really good, with a great flavor and a cute shape. I especially loved the white sauce - it was a definite standout. Overall, a great experience!",1
"I'm giving this place 5 stars based purely on the lunch specials. I dare you to find another place in this neighborhood where you can have a sit down lunch during the work week for this price. The lunch specials are $10.95 and come with sangria! I go here all the time. The staff is super friendly. My favorite of the lunch specials is the cheese enchilada plate which comes with two cheese enchiladas, rice and beans. I'm from Texas and this stratifies my cheese enchilada craving. Sometimes to mix things up I'll try one cheese enchilada and one crispy shredded chicken taco, which is fine. Most recently I branded out to a hamburger (good) and a taco salad (also good). I've never waited to be seated at lunch time. I also love how quick this place is.",0
"Can't go wrong with CM. This time, we ordered goat confit, octopus and skirt steak. Creme Catalan was good, but not the best among their desserts. Most of the dishes ordered had sauce with pronounced acidity.....something to keep in mind when ordering a bottle. We ended up ordering a Rioja, but I'll definitely order something more jammy or slightly effervescent next time.

I should've ordered the chocolate cake. Here are some photos of their new outdoor seating as of Feb 9.

-Goat confit: Melt in mouth and well seasoned goat. The sauce (goat cheese avocado) is to die for. I wish I had ordered an acidic white, not a Rioja-Steak: A bit too much of those balsamic onion this time. But the steak itself was perfectly prepared-Octopus salad: THE dish that makes me return here. Crispy yet succulent tentacles..... Just give it shot. You won't regret it. Maybe get an orange wine with this?",1
"This is going to be short and to the point. My friend kept insisting that I purchase a Groupon for this place for dinner and wine tasting. I should've known when I paid the price that this wouldn't end up well. We drove there on a Saturday and were seated immediately. And so the torture, I mean the tasting began. Now let me be clear, I'll drink anything, like pretty much anything but this was a joke. It's totally boxed wine. It's funny because the gentleman serving us could tell we knew. He couldn't tell me about the year and country it was from with a straight face,  so instead he would rush and walk away. Now that we got over the wine, let me just say that this was the first time in many years that I walked out of a place and left the entire dish there without even saying a word. Yes, is was that bad. It was the worst dish I've had in years. Boiled salted pasta with a few shrimp on top. Wait it was salt and a little boxed wine for the sauce. This was just terrible, both dishes we ordered were terrible. How can a place get it ALL wrong? I can't get over this place and I just wonder how it's still in business. I just realized this wasn't short at all! Oopps!!!",0
"We came here after our original dinner plans fell through and saw that they had some last minute reservations available. It definitely became apparent why they did- this restaurant is quite far from nearby attractions and the service was not great. The food was also quite mediocre. We were all pretty hungry when we sat down and the food came quickly but we were disappointed with the quality at the end. Their pizzas are definitely better than their pastas. I would give the Daniele pizza a 4/5 but the rigatoni just a 3/5. If you're just looking for a no fuss Italian dinner this would be good, but otherwise I'd say skip this and make a reservation for another nearby Italian restaurant.",0
This is my spot. Great bang for buck over-the-counter Chinese restaurant around. You can eat for 2 at twenty bucks and have leftoI love the fact they got on e-commerce since Covid. You can put in the order in Yelp and they'll let you know when it's ready to pick up.They shifted the chef or recipes- the ingredients are more fresh and presentation has been looking better.,0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The staff was attentive and seemed to work well together, and the interior was modern and clean. The standout dish for me was the sweet pickle ribs, which were definitely flavorful. However, I didn't enjoy the fried prawn main dish as much, as it was bland and not very spicy. Most of the other dishes were in between good and bad, with some being slightly better than others. Overall, I think it's worth checking out if you're in the area, but I'd recommend going to a more casual Indian restaurant instead if you can afford it.",1
"After a long day my co worker and I decided we needed a drink! After walking for blocks and noticed no one really had a nice outdoor set up or a happy hour, we stumbled upon ""Wild"". You can literally walk right past it but they have such a big outdoor set up that it caught our attention.The hosts were very attentive and even offered to bring water for my co workers dog. Such a nice gesture. Drinks were about $8-12 dollars on happy hours and food was priced as normal.We decided to get red sangria and their Festa beef nachos. Everything looked fresh as you can see in the picture. The beef was well seasoned the sauce was so good. I was so happy it wasn't one of those cheese wiz vibes, more of a queso blanco. Delicious, the drinks weren't really that strong in my opinion but I probably would need a few more to drown my sorrows.The inside is very quaint and I LOVE that they have live music. I would def go back.",0
"Reliable standby for New York style pizza. Apparently, a lot of famous people have come here, if that's a draw for you. The slices are huge. I can usually get full on one and only need two if I'm super hungry. Nothing fancy in terms of toppings/styles - it's pretty much just cheese, white, pepperoni, meat, margherita (though with spinach instead of basil). Not a lot of seating and inside is standing room only. This is a grab and go kind of place.",0
"I visited Enzo Bruni Pizza for the first time today and I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was delicious and the cheese combination was fantastic. The bread was fresh out of the oven and it was so full I couldn't finish the crust. I'm definitely going to be back! The only downside is that they don't have the kitchen open yet, so I couldn't order anything to go. But I'm hopeful that they'll open soon. The employees were really friendly and knowledgeable, and they clearly have a lot of passion for this restaurant. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.",1
"Came here for a work team dinner, so when we arrived we were seated in a private room upstairs.  It was nice that they were able to accommodate dietary restrictions such as a gluten-free diet and a vegan diet, although there was a bit of confusion once when they mixed up those two special dishes, which caused a bit of worry that that dish and all future ones were given correctly.  Some of the dishes were great such as the fried mountain yam with edamame, but some others were just alright or even a bit disappointing.  It was clear that this was fine dining, but I think that for the same price there are much better fine dining options in the city.",0
"The most important measure of how good a poke joint is is the freshness of the ingredients. On this score, I can say that Wisefish is reliably good.  It's great for lunch (or to grab a meal on the go). The place is sparse: there's one communal table and a few seats by the window. That said, I've never had problems finding a seat since a lot of people will order something to go.They have a number of poke bowls that are superb (my favorite is the Heat Wave). You can also build your own. The last few times I've ordered here I've built my own since the price comes out to be about the same as you'd pay for one of their bowls, except you get to pick only the things you want. They are very generous when it comes to the toppings you can select (I think it's up to 6), and there are choices for both traditionalists (e.g. carrots, cucumbers) and adventurists (wasabi peas, anyone?). The sauces are also great--I love the citrus shoyu.",0
"I had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! The atmosphere is amazing - it's decorated so well and has a really cool vibe. The drinks are great, and the food is even better. Everything we ordered was really good, and the presentation was top-notch. I especially loved the Octopus - it was so pretty to look at and taste! I can't wait to come back and try everything else!",1
"Had the rice roll with veggie meat and shrimp dumpling. First time having vegan/vegetarian Chinese food. It was pretty good. Prices are super reasonable and good quantity of food. They gave us a beeper for when we wanted service or to pay bill which was neat-O.The items weren't high in sodium, which I enjoyed but if you like your food salty. You might want to ask for salt or soy sauce.",0
"We had a pretty bad experience at this restaurant. The food was mostly gross, and the guacamole was barely edible. We definitely would not recommend it.",1
"The Ja Jang Style Ribs are incredible! The Wagyu Ramyun was also good, but the lamb was my favorite. The banchan was also great, especially the banchan egg. The only thing I didn't like about the meal was the myun. It was a little too spicy for my taste. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely come back.",1
Note: This review is for dinner.Grey Dog is A-OK in every way. I got the kale Caesar salad with chicken and it was average at best. Nothing at all special. Ordered a glass of wine with it and everything was very over priced.The restaurant itself is cramped. You're elbow to elbow with the table next to you. Can't imagine this is going to sustain in the times of COVID 19. Regardless it has a casual ambiance that makes it good for a casual meet up.,0
"I was so excited to try Dumplings on the Upper West Side (UWS) and Vanessa's new restaurant has finally arrived!

We walked by Friday night, grabbed a paper menu but the line was too long and we didn't want to wait. 

We returned the next day (Saturday) around 3pm and ordered a huge dinner to take home and binge watch ""The Boys"" - ordered 6 different types of dumplings and two noodle dishes (sesame peanut sauce noodles and dan dan spicy beef noodles. 

The price was reasonable about $60 total and even though there were around 8-10 customers ahead of us, we only waited 15 minutes before the server came outside and handed us our takeout. 

Our favorite dumplings were the boiled Spicy Wontons with shrimp and chicken and the Spicy Beef. 

These are NYC American-Chinese-style dumplings. 

The wrappers are pretty thick and we couldn't really distinguish the different fillings (except for the Chive & Pork boiled dumplings, the Spicy Wontons 红油抄手 and Spicy Beef dumplings). 

I surprised myself",1
"So much was disappointing about this place. The menu was incredibly limited when we went that we just bluff a couple of things to share (fries and avocado toast) and headed to another location to actually enjoy brunch. Things were also overpriced for what we were getting too... I am giving the location 3 stars however because the drinks were actually fun and tasty. If you want to go here just for the instagrammable drinks, this is the place for you! If you're here for food, I recommend going elsewhere.",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch and was really impressed. The food was solid and the happy hour specials were a nice addition. The service was also good, and I didn't have to wait long for my food. Overall, I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at this restaurant! The lamb combo plate was delicious, and the falafel was some of the best I've ever had. The only downside was that I didn't love the tabbouleh and baklava, but overall the food was fantastic. The service was great, and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at Sugarfish. The service was really poor - the first girl we spoke to didn't even bother to look at us and proceeded to talk to her co-workers. The other two servers who were working didn't seem to care either. The food was also quite bland - the sashimi tuna was alright, but the sauce was way too overpowering. The rice was also falling apart. The handroll with crab meat was also rather disappointing - there was barely any crab meat in it, and the mayo was really overpowering. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for omakase - there are other places that do a much better job for the same price.",1
I came last night February 25th for a birthday celebration.  I would give this restaurant 4 starts but the server Antonio was aweful. He was slow and inattentive. Also my lamb chops were very good but the food was cold. I would give 5 stars but you lost a star for serving cold food.Lamb Chops 4 starsHost Cassidy 5 starsDrinks 4 starsService 1 starAmbiance 5 startsI did like the restaurant and I will be back again. Hopefully my server will not be Antonio,0
"Overall, I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The service was good, and the food was delicious. My only complaint is that our waiter was not very attentive. He seemed to be more interested in other tables than ours.",1
"I really enjoyed Pure Thai Cookhouse, but it didn't blow me away like I thought it would given all the hype. I have tried coming here a few times prior, but the wait is generally incredibly long, given how small the restaurant space is. I came on a Thursday night at 9:30pm with two others and still ended up waiting around 45 minutes.

I ordered the wok basil with chicken based off of the recommendation of Yelp and the pad kee mao with chicken. The basil with chicken was really good. It doesn't look like much more than a lot of ground chicken with a few peppers, but it's really flavorful (borderline overly salty), and the white rice that comes with it complements it well. It definitely had some heat to it, so be forewarned. The pad kee mao was also delicious. I loved the wide noodles they used, and the portion size was pretty generous. I really enjoyed Pure Thai cookhouse but wouldn't wait more than 45 min for it again, especially given how many Thai restaurants there are in the area. I slightly prefer the likes of Up Thai and SomTumDer more.",1
"Better than El Gordo in Vegas! 
And it's not as crazy, but still pretty busy. 
They have an organised system: 
line-up, order and pay, get a ticket, and give ticket to taco assembler man! 
Each taco were ~$4ea and from the looks of it, the quesadillas weren't much bigger. 
2 tacos were enough for a snack/light meal. The Pollo was soo tasty and was quite stuffed, even though the shell was small. 
Shells were also really tasty and did NOT fall apart - my pet peeve!

There's no places to sit. 
It is just a really busy ordering counter and you eat elsewhere.

Really good!",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The ambiance was nice and the servers were friendly. There was no line when I came, so I was able to sit and wait for my friend. The burgers looked delicious and the patties weren't average sized - I was surprised by the flavor. The burger with the egg was also great and came out to be quite pricy at $20, but it was definitely worth it. The fries were also delicious and very crispy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had an unpleasant phone call and never got my order from Very Thai, which is a shame because the restaurant has some great reviews. I placed an order a day in advance for noon on Tuesday, but on Monday after 1 pm, I received a call from a delivery person. I explained that I wasn't there to pick up the food as I had ordered it for the following day. A few hours later, I received a call from someone who insisted that I cancel the order as they had ""already lost money trying to deliver food that day because the delivery guy didn't bring the food back"" and would not deliver the food on Tuesday. When I explained that the restaurant had attempted to deliver the order on the wrong day, she said that they didn't have the delivery slip anymore because it was with the food. (I checked the Seamless order after the call; the date was Tuesday, as I intended.) It didn't really make sense that they wanted me to cancel the order as a result of their mistake because it seems that they would lose money by losing a purchase. I felt the situation wasn't handled well.",1
"Grandma chicken mixian was delicious and complex with a black sesame garlic oil. The chicken was in the style of pulled pork but actually quite tender. The broth was perfect for the chilly weather. Beef shank JB melt was also very moist and went well with self serve chili oil. A bit messy but that's also a sign of a very flavorful sandwich. We made it a combo, as we wanted the extra broth. I loved it even more than the mixian broth, as it was much stronger in flavor, with a touch of Chinese medicinal herbs. The marinated cabbage came as a tiny side dish.",1
"The new restaurant from the Pickle Guys, right next door, just quietly opened today ahead of the grand opening tomorrow.They so far have a small menu of all pickle-related stuff, and it's all fried and delicious. Definitely try the Beyond Burger ($11) and the Pickled Fries ($5), but the Riceballs ($7) are excellent too. Will definitely be back to try more new stuff as it comes out.",0
"I got the Salted Egg Yolk & Pork Floss Guokui. 

It makes for a good midday snack because it's crispy and toasty. 

I think there could've been more flavor to the filling like some garlic or scallions.",1
"I was craving sushi, so I ordered a few different rolls last Friday night via DoorDash. 1- Build Your Own Box: $23- BYO Rolls: Spicy Tuna (4 pieces)- BYO Rolls: Spicy Salmon (4 pieces)- BYO Rolls: Salmon Jalapeno (4 pieces)- BYO Rolls: Salmon Avocado (4 pieces)2- Spicy Tuna roll (8 pieces) $10.50  - Pros: Fast delivery (from order to delivery- within 30 mins); nice modern packaging- Cons:  It was just OK. I specifically ordered spicy rolls since I like heat, BUT the spicy tuna/ spicy salmon really were not spicy at all. This was a tad disappointing. Did it satisfy my sushi craving? Yes. Was it mediocre sushi though? Yes. Would I order from Bondi Sushi again? Unfortunately, probably not.",0
"As others noted, the inside is beautiful.  Staff are very friendly and quite polished.  Also, it is nice the hostess makes a note about theater times to make sure you stay on track with your meal and don't run out of time.I included a picture of the bar [one of my favorite places in a reastaurant ; - ) ].  It is beautiful and EXTENSIVE.  We had the Midtown version of the old fashioned, a berry mocktail, and bottle of sparkling water.  The mocktail and cocktail were both tasty and well made.For food we had a ""platter"" of dumplings (6 or 8 dumplings), lamb chops, seafood clay pot, pak choi (bok choy for those as ignorant as me) and two orders of rice.  For dessert we shared a sorbet.The total price including tip was $226.  It was ok, but it felt just a little light on the value side.  We could just be less sophisticated with Asian cuisine, but we know of lots of better options at a lower price point.  Of course, polish costs money, but it just didn't quite keep up with the food, which was ok, just not causing us to want to make a return visit.  You may feel differently.  Clearly, lots of people love Hakkasan, and you might too.",0
"Quality has gone down in the past few years. I ordered the Pad Thai again, but this time, I asked if they could make it spicy. Apparently to them, this just means to add extra salt/fish sauce. I was only able to eat half before my tongue started to get numb from all the sodium, and I didn't want it to fall off. I paid $18 (including tax and tip) for some Bad Thai. On the flip side, my colleague ordered the chow fun and said it was bland AF. Guess they saved all the salt for my dish.



Wei West was the go-to for team outtings since it is close to the office and can usually seat large groups (I say usually because this past time we went, our group of ten was seated by the sushi bar, even though we made reservations ahead of time). Kind of defeats the whole purpose of a team lunch. Will be looking for a new spot next time.",1
"Friday night....couldn't decide, surf or turf....doing the Yelp search came across Burger & Lobster.  Despite a mix up in my reservation, we were seated in 15 minutes with no reservation.Decor was nice but had induced loud conversation. Music was a little loud so you had to talk louder to have a conversation. Linen napkins step up from the wood tables. Hostess was pleasant with her assistant who sat us equally as nice. Our server came over asked us if we knew what we wanted before we had a chance to peruse the menu. He left and cameback after a few minutes. Ordering we went with a burger and a lobster roll. Both came with salad and fries. We asked for 2 Cokes and was informed they serve organic cola. Really? Organic cola? I've heard of organic fruits and veggies, organic dairy, organic meats but organic soda? Ok, I'll let the taste speak for organic cola.The burger delivered by a food runner was cooked medium just as ordered and the fries we warm. Lobster roll was meaty with lobster meat(I wondered if it was organic) with a hint of the Japanese mayo. Fries too were warm. Salad was a cup of soup cup size and boring. Was the dressing organic?Bus girl got us refills since our waiter had disappeared. Time for dessert? Nope, didn't see anything on the menu about dessert. Got and paid the check and went to dessert at the soft serve truck on the corner of 42nd and 5th.Returning? I'll give it an Organic no.",0
"Extremely enjoyed our dinner after a Broadway play. We started with the escargot - followed by the salmon and with steak with fries. It was also my birthday, they bought out beautiful dessert I recommend this place. The interior is also extremely beautiful.",0
"This place USED to be better.. I was very disappointed.. ordered cheese kimbab, lack of vegetables (they could have put more vegetables in it. please do not say order vegetable kimbab. you know what I meant). this ajumma (seemed like an owner. there was older ajumma there though) kept talking while preparing for kimbab.. please do not put saliva in my kimbab lol.not sure if i would be back. food galley kimbab is way better",0
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The vegetables are always delicious and fresh, and the dishes are healthy without tasting too healthy. My personal favorite dish is the yuca fries which come with a chipotle mayo, brussel sprouts, asparagus and broccoli. The garlic mashed potatoes are also delicious, and boy loves turkey party for his side of protein - me, tofu or salmon. I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
SOLID pizza sauce and a quick and tasty 2/$5 with a drink special. My go-to for a reliable slice!,0
"I bought 2 rice rolls, gave one to my parents.. they haven't had this style of rice roll in ages.. 30 years ago, they were .40 or so and pretty tiny. $2.50 wasn't too bad each, considering the size. It's like a small burrito. They do give a generous amount of meat, lots of green onions, dried shrimp. I didn't really think I'd like it but it's got good flavor, loved the green onions. It is greasy which keeps the rice rolls from sticking together, I added my own chili sauce. They gave packets of hot sauce but chili sauce adds more flavor. They only sell 3 items, a bit limited but the food was tasty and fresh. The rice rolls weren't mushy at all, great texture. They didn't even dry out after I left them sitting in a bowl for at least a few hrs since I was busy and forgot I took it out of the box. Microwaved it for less than a min just to get it a bit warm and it was great.",1
"After hitting the books, I decided to take a lunch break. I considered my many options nearby, and came across this place.I decided to keep it simple, and order chicken with broccoli, with a side of rice. I was hoping for some decent tasting food, but unfortunately, the food came out rather bland.What stuck out most about this meal is the overuse of salt, which left me feeling lethargic for a few hours after the meal.The food did not sit well with me, and I tossed the leftovers rather than use them to cook a future meal.They need to work on their taste. And stop using so much salt... it is no substitute for good cooking.",0
"Was recommended this place and loved it! Rushed here on a Sunday evening and there actually wasn't a ton of people, but maybe like 25% full? So no wait at all. Ordered the soup dumplings ofc and they were so good, I wish I had more. The crab & pork one is only slightly different than the pork one, but the crab isn't super noticeable. Also got a beef dish that was really good, but a little salty so would get with like a fried rice next time! Portion was also big, but we managed to finish everything and walk out exploding haha. Would recommend for anyone craving dumplings and warm dishes! Environment is very spacious and large too, so great for groups and a nice night out",0
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The interior is very beautiful and the food was exceptional. I especially enjoyed the duck and pork buns, edamame dumplings, Broken Chili Chicken, short ribs, lobster fried rice, Asian green stir fry, tuna tartare spring rolls, and Kung pao monkfish. It was plenty for six people and the drinks were very well-crafted and had a very low alcohol content, which was a downside. However, the restaurant was very loud and dark, so take note if you're looking for a quiet evening out.",1
"This review is based on a birthday event I hosted here on July 15th. I am normally one to stray from big birthday celebrations but I decided to give it a try this time around. Booking the event was pretty smooth and simple. I sent a booking request via their website and heard back from someone within 24 hours. Any questions I asked were answered promptly. For a reservation, the minimum requirement is 2 lanes for 2 hours with 6 ppl max per lane, which will cost you around $350 (food and drink not included but shoes are). There is a kitchen and guests are able to order typical bar food. The other Gutter locations were about $90 less but don't offer food. We were allowed to bring in a cake and treats as well. When I arrived for my 6 pm reservation at 6 pm, all lanes were occupied. They apparently forgot to reserve two lanes for my event. They were not apologetic at all. Instead they offered the people playing several free shots to free the lanes. I made a joke about a free shot for my birthday and apparently it was not funny because the host had a stone cold face. Playing was fun and my guests had a good time. The interior of the bar is cool and the over all concept is a good idea. The staff helped store the cake and were available to help bring it out when we needed. At the end of the two hours, they stopped our game promptly, which surprised me. Though I understand the principal, there were about 3-4 other free lanes and the place was not busy at all. No one asked if we wanted to add more time and considering our late start because we waited for people to clear the lanes, they could've at least given us an extra 5 minutes. I would return to this location to grab a beer and bowl with a friend or two but would not host an event here again.",0
"I was lucky to find a table at the bar when I arrived for my reservation, but I was quickly seated in the main dining room.

I started with the Pan con Tomate, which was delicious - the bread was nicely seasoned, and the tomato, garlic, and olive oil mixture made a great combination.

Next, I had the Gambas de Ajillo - these shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the garlic, brandy, and pepper mixture added a nice flavor.

The Gambas de Palamos were also good - the shrimp were springy and delicious, and the saltiness was a great contrast to the sweetness of the croquetas.

The Croquetas Cremosas were also a hit - they were creamy and delicious, and the croquetas themselves were crispy.

I also tried the Judias Verdes con Romesco - these green beans were cooked perfectly, and the tempura batter made them very light and crispy.

The staff was attentive and checked in with me to make sure everything was going well - they did a great job of making me feel welcome.

Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant - the tapas were fresh and well-seasoned,",1
"Il Buco is a great Italian restaurant with a lively atmosphere. The food is pretty good, and the service is great. I have to get used to getting just tap water without ice, but it's a great place with rustic vibes.",1
The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very friendly. The waitstaff were all very knowledgable about the menu and what each dish consisted of. The food was absolutely amazing! The only downside was that the unagi at the end was not my favorite. I would definitely come back and try out some of their other dishes!,1
"I really wanted to love this place, because the food is really good...but I have to unfortunately echo the sentiments of the other reviewers. The service is awful. Servers are unfriendly and unhelpful, and service is SO slow. Even preCOVID, food and drinks took forever. Also the drinks are pretty bad. I don't know who the bartender/mixologist is but they need to revamp the recipes. I would honestly just order delivery for the food...but would hesitate to dine in again.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant on my way to a show in the theater district and the line was long but it went so quick. The food tasted amazing at first, with a delicious Indian tikka flair to it. But six hours later, I had terrible nausea and food poisoning from it. Hopefully this was just a one-time thing, but wanted to share the experience in case others are considering this restaurant.",1
"Never disappoints! Carne asada is my fave, con todo, of course! The meat is cooked and seasoned nicely, can't complain here!",0
"I came to Skirt Steak with my fiancée on a cold Thursday night. I don't believe they do reservations so we walked in and were seated promptly. The restaurant was half full upon our entry at 6:15 and completely full when we left nearly an hour later. I really wanted to love this place but I have to be honest, I wasn't that impressed. The price point at 29 dollars was good but the food was just ok. The salad didn't taste like much and the steak and fries were not at the quality of the other famous place in town with this concept. We got Brussels sprouts as our add on and it was mushy and did not taste good. Got the carrot cake and chocolate mousse as dessert which we did not think were great and did not finish. The add ons add up fast on the bill and aren't worth the calories. I think this is ok for a casual dinner option but don't expect anything super delicious. I wouldn't come back.",1
"What a nice surprise to dine outdoors on a busy 2nd Ave on a busy Saturday night. Menus are accessible via the QR code. The ceviches are excellent. We tried the mixto (mixed seafood with a kick- a little spice) and the yellowfin tuna ceviches. For appetizers, the octopus sashimi was nice with a touch of potatoes and avocado. The rock shrimp tempura and maitake mushroom dishes are hot dishes and tasty- the most favored starter dishes. The crab cake was not but did seem standard compared to the other dishes. For entrees, the seafood paella and slow braised short ribs won our hearts. So tasty and satisfying. We also tried the lomo saltado, the duck, and the salmon dishes. The menu has a diverse selection of different proteins (except no vegetarian entrees). The sides consisted of vegetable dishes and we got the yuca fries and brussel sprouts, the latter being the favorite. For desserts, we tried the guava cheesecake, which was delicious, and the tres leches, which was amazing- one of the best tres leches I've ever had. Service was friendly and attentive. Despite the occasional traffic noise and sirens, the meal and experience by the kitchen and staff was excellent all-around.",0
"I would give this restaurant a 4 but I'm giving it 1 less star for making us wait 40 minutes even though we had a reservation. It's pretty ironic that they can cancel the reservation on you if you're 15 minutes late, but they can make you wait for 40 minutes without any explanation. In order to make up for the wait, they gave us 2 apps on the house, which was appreciated and very good. The first was green chickpea hummus which was one of the best dishes we had that day.  It had plenty of flavor and was very creamy. Additionally, they gave us avocado toast which was also very good. You needed to squeeze a bit of lime on top because without it, it was pretty bland. I got the mushroom and egg dish (substituted poached eggs with scrambled eggs) and really enjoyed it. Everything was very flavorful and the eggs were perfectly cooked. We also shared the fingerling potatoes which I would recommend. I did taste the coconut sticky rice dish and lentil dish and didn't really enjoy either of those, but my table liked them. I wouldn't rush to come back especially if the restaurant would make me wait again for 40 minutes even when having a reservation.",1
"Excellent Italian restaurant in SoHo. The menu is delicious. I started with the artichokes cacio e Pepe style which were crunchy and delicious. Next was the truffle ravioli which was incredibly rich. I finished off with the Dover sole which was cooked to perfection and came with a lemon caper sauce, broccoli and French fries. For dessert I had lemon sorbet which was yummy as well. Highly recommend this restaurant",0
"I had a great experience ordering my cowboy bowl at Daring Plant-Based. The order was ready on time and the ingredients were simple but well-balanced. The sauce was not too heavy and tied everything together well. I would love to see more vegan bowl options on the menu, as this would make it even easier to order.",1
"I came right after their happy hour for dinner, pretty busy for a Tuesday night, definitely will be back for happy hour next time!

Our starters were all amazing. The oysters tasted fresh and the kimchi herb butter it comes with paired well. The crab also tasted fresh. Think about the fried feta like a feta version of fried mozzarella that comes with a generous portion of tzaziki. I loved this! Definitely a great starter for people who enjoy feta.

The grilled oyster came with a side of bread that I dipped in feta, definitely hit the spot. I got the wagyu burger with paprika fries and a side salad and my boyfriend got the lobster roll with pesto fries and a side salad. The fries were skinny fries and seasoned very well. Enjoyed the vinaigrette on the salad as well, had a pretty sweet subtle taste to it. I did ask for my burger to be medium rare... not sure if it was a miscommunication but my burger came out pretty well done.. so much more on the dryer side. Only complaint really. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster roll. Our waiter was pretty attentive and came to check on us pretty often.",1
"Wow. What is going on with the bartenders here? Came by on a Saturday afternoon/early evening. The place was full but not overcrowded. A group of us sat at the bar to celebrate a friend's birthday. The 3 female bartenders were rude to a point where we were not sure how to respond to them, but they honestly were acting like they were working a sports bar and were 3 hours into a game and had been dealing with out of control drunk sports fans all day. However, they HAD NOT so there was no reason for their behavior. I thought Jack and Fanny's was a chill place, but don't come looking to relax and grab a drink because once you interact with a bartender there you will feel like an asshole for even just ordering one.They were pretty consistently moving around the bar talking/CLEARLY bitching about patrons while facing other patrons. How is this appropriate? I also heard them get into two altercations not worth getting into - one was after a patron ordered a drink 2 times with one bartender and she didn't bring it over, he finally asked the other bartender. She didn't bring it either, so he asked the original, and the original one just goes ""I'll bring it, but don't ever again ask another bartender for something you already asked me for."" What the hell? In what world is it ok to threaten a customer over your lack of service? If you had brought it they wouldn't have to ask everyone in sight to get one drink.The entire time it was also impossible to flag them down - again, acting like they were in a rowdy sports bar on football Sunday. Nope, beautiful and casual Saturday afternoon, with a pretty chill crowd (no one I noticed was overly intoxicated to a point of being a nuisance for staff). Really horrified by them here - definitely something I will consider before coming back.",0
"I would rate Osteria Al Doge three and a half stars.I dined in with some family and friends after watching a broadway show nearby. We shared a couple appetizers including grilled octopus as well as a prosciutto and soft cheese appetizer. The grilled octopus was my favorite item. It had a nice char on the tips. For my main course, I shared caprese pizza. Like in proper Italian cuisine, there was plenty of arugula with each dish.",0
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The line was long, and the food wasn't great. The only redeeming quality was that the staff was friendly. I ordered a platter of food, but it was difficult to get my order corrected. The bagels I ordered twice were terrible, and the omelette was just okay. The restaurant was a bit crowded, but I didn't see anyone wearing gloves or wearing their masks half way.",1
"Bo Peep is a restaurant that I absolutely loved! I made a reservation through Resy and showed up 40 minutes early, but the staff was able to accommodate me. The speakasy portion of the restaurant is stunning, and the Fried Chicken sliders were amazing. The service was also fantastic. As we were leaving, there was a gentleman around 7pm starting to set up for his set at the piano. I would definitely recommend Bo Peep to anyone!",1
"The space is small and can be quite crowded, so be sure to call ahead if you're looking to visit. The service was friendly, but a bit weird at times - they would switch back and forth between being attentive and disappearing for a bit. The food itself wasn't anything to write home about, but it was good enough that we didn't get too drunk. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but I would recommend checking out the happy hour deal first to see if it's any better.",1
"The Saturday brunch experience at this restaurant with a group of out-of-town girls was really fun. There were bottomless options other than mimosas - there was $27 for either mimosas, original margaritas, or Smokey spicy margaritas. I ordered the Smokey spicy margarita and it was delicious and strong. However, the food was just OK - I ordered the pulpo sandwich and it was a little overcooked along with the pork belly. Additionally, some people got seriously drunk here and one person threw up in the bathroom. However, overall still a fun time.",1
"After trying Yellow Rose's tacos, I then stopped by Planet Taco for their quesobirilla and carnitas tacos. The tacos were good and flavorful albeit a bit small with not a lot of meat. This place has very good hot sauces, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars versus 3 stars. I will return to try the other hot sauces.",0
"Stout NYC is a great place to go for a good meal. The location is excellent, and the service was great. The burger was made perfectly to my order, and the salad was delicious. Overall, I would definitely recommend Stout NYC to anyone looking for a great dining experience.",1
"I had a great experience at this diner this morning! The waitstaff was really friendly and accommodating, and the food came quickly. The pancakes were especially delicious, and I really enjoyed the mimosa I ordered. It was a really busy morning, so I'm glad I found this place. It's open 24/7, so it's great for when you need some good food in a hurry. I would definitely recommend it!",1
"This place doesn't have much of a wait, and it's pretty spacious. Not to mention how upscale this place looks to some of the other Korean bbq places like Kang ho dong or jongro. Service is quick, and set up is pretty similar to Kang ho dong (eggs, cheese corn, kimchi/veggies along the grill) with cooking service. My only gripe was that they stopped cooking our last meat too soon, so it was pretty raw inside. The decor is much nicer here, and service is fast, but I think the winner of flavors has to go to Kang ho dong. Also, they were pretty stingy with replacing the side dishes and lettuce. I think it was more or less the lack of workers. For the number of tables there were only like 2 or 3 servers. The servers always looked rushed. They have a vacuum over the grill, so you won't smell as much as you would do at jongro. Regarding pricing-its pretty expensive. I'd get one of their combo meals that come with 3 different types of meat and either kimchi stew or bean stew ~$90 for 3 people which isn't too terrible. One pro is that they take reservations which is worth it if you don't want to wait the 90 minutes to get a seat at jongro or Kang ho dong.",0
"We came here for dinner and had an amazing dinner. We sat outside, which was nice and warm and so pretty! We had the following:- Fresh baked ""tigelle""  buns with Parma prosciutto: this was amazing and you should definitely get this. The buns were warm and fresh and the prosciutto was sliced perfectly (very thin and melt in your mouth). - Spaghetti alla chitarra con ragu' bolognese:: the pasta was fresh and the sauce was good, but nothing special- Cavatelli di ricotta: I got this without salmon and really enjoyed this pasta dish. The pasta was fresh and the pesto sauce was creamy but not too creamy-duck special: my husband got this dish and loved itOverall, I would recommend visiting this restaurant",0
"We were in the area for work and happened to stop in since I had this marked down to try. Pretty simple menu to choose from. I wanted to give a few things a try so I went with their Harlem Classic burger (2 smashed patties, cheese, onions, pickles, and special sauce), a Classic fried chicken sandwich (no slaw), french fries, and a lemonade.Burger was really good. They smash the patties thin and let them sit, so they had a really nice crust on them. Pickles, onions, and sauce are on the bottom bun and the cheese is between the two patties, which means good flavor distribution. Chicken was well seasoned, felt like maybe a slight spice, and crispy. It's a decent sized piece, though a little thin in spots, so you can end up with a drier bite here and there. Fries were your standard, tasty shoestring fry.Liked everything, though I think the sandwiches are maybe a little overpriced for what it is. I'd definitely go back.",0
"We've been here a few times, and we really enjoyed their fried dumplings and dumplings in soup. Their soup is really good that we almost always finish drinking all of it. My parents also liked their soup, too. Their dumplings are big in size for the low price. The chicken with basil and pork with chives are delicious both fried and in soup. We were not a big fan of their pancakes. It takes longer for them to make the dumpling in soup than the fried ones. They accept cash unless you spend over $15 then they will take credit cards. Minus 1 star because if you go during rush hour times, it gets really hectic. Finding a spot to sit is like a battlefield. Everyone is fighting for the same spots and you're constantly eyeing to see who is going to leave soon. It's definitely one of those places where you go in and eat and then leave. It's not meant for sit-down to chit-chat. But still highly recommend it!",0
"Club A Steakhouse is a great restaurant if you're looking for a romantic dinner. The food is delicious, and the service is great. I especially love the ambiance - it's very romantic. My only complaint is that the portions are a bit on the small side, so if you're not careful you may end up overeating.",1
"Take me back to a time where all restaurants had the same charm as Delmonico's. A classic feel - just think of all the influential people who have dined here.. It was a Thursday night during restaurant week, my boyfriend and I had reservations for 8 PM (made 2 days prior). The restaurant was packed and there were a heard of people waiting for their reservations amongst us. It was such a beautiful space. We only waited about 10 minutes for our table to be ready. As we were seated, we found the Delmonico signature plates neatly placed on our table. Our server greeted us and ran through the specials, but we already had an idea of what we were going to order. Appetizer; - Crispy local Burrata: My goodness, the most milkiest and soft textured burrata you've ever tasted. - Heritage Pig Bolognese: Perfectly cooked cavatelli with a tasty bolognese sauce. Great portion for an appetizer, too much of this would be too heavy. Entrees; - 18 Hour Braised Short Ribs: A standard short rib, just a tad dry in my opinion. - Prime Delmonico Rib Eye (medium cooked), accompanied with a side of mixed vegetables: A-freaking-mazing, that's all I have to say. So worth the $20 supplement. Dessert; - Baked Alaska: I saw this all over Yelp, I had to taste it for myself, did not disappoint. I've never had a baked Alaska this good.- NY Style Cheesecake: Honestly, a great piece of cheesecake. Really would recommend if you are on the fence. I hate to say it but service was a bit lacking. We tried to flag down our server for something and we couldn't get a hold of him. He was a bit inattentive which was surprising for a restaurant at this standard. Delmonico's can be a little pricey, thank you for participating with restaurant week!!",0
"Ordered a large pie with half olives and half cheese. They were running a 25% perk on Seamless so it was a pretty decent price. I liked how the olives were mostly left whole, which gave it a kind of rustic feel. Overall the pizza is standard NY style cheese with very light tomato sauce. Because they're both in HK, I feel like this spot versus Casabianca, I'd prefer Casabianca because there's more cheese. It was fine for the price. Delivery came in time and I have no complaints other than ""I've had better for the price."" It's very acceptable standard pizza fare.",0
"I found Nowon Korean BBQ to be a great spot for a casual meal. The food is tasty and affordable, and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. I especially loved the chopped cheese rice cakes, which reminded me a lot of Hamburger Helper but with better ingredients. The burger was also very juicy and well seasoned, and it was great to see that it was made specifically for me. Overall, I would definitely recommend Nowon for a casual meal.",1
"Restaurant Week Winter 2021 Baked Mediterranean branzino with fingerling potatoes, haricot vert, and hummus I had Barbounia on my short list before but then my fam didn't choose it one night. When they drive by it, they were like omg it looks so nice on the outside and looks packed with people. We assume that equates to good food so we planned to get it next time. (Inside looks nice too)There are three restaurant week meal options: branzino, short rib, vegetables. Again fam is more of meat people, so it was choosing between branzino and short rib. Originally we were against fish because afraid it'll be fishy or dry or plain. Then we ended up getting it anyway because it seems more exciting than short rib. We've never had branzino anyway. Although the skin got all soggy, the branzino had great grill flavor. It's savory without being too salty. The natural fish flavor came through nicely. I didn't get any olives or tomatoes. Beans were a bit stiff. I'm surprised they gave hummus. I like this more than other hummus I've tried. It tastes more bright and fresh, less nutty and earthy. I like the bread they gave too. It has a pretzel like exterior. I expected this place to be overrated considering how it has a lot of reviews yet not that high average rating. I was actually surprised by what I got but not to the point of being amazed. Solid and happy to go again in person. 4*",0
"I came to this restaurant with a group of friends on a Saturday and it was quite crowded. However, it wasn't long before we were seated. Once our party was ready, we were seated in 5-10min. The decor is nice, and the staff is friendly. However, the food did come up quite slowly! I think it took 30-40 min for our food to come up after we placed the order. I remember I drank all of my latte while my food was nowhere to be seen. Make sure you know what you want before you sit down and just order it right away! The burger was fantastic - it was juicy and tasty. The banana bread French toast was also good - it didn't taste like a French toast, more like a sweet banana bread. It was quite filling and sweet. The chai latte was also ok - the flavor was just ok, but it was still drinkable. The bbq brekkie bowl was also good - my friend wasn't impressed, but I thought it was really good. Overall, the service was good, and the food was decent. Just remember to order your food quickly, otherwise you might be waiting a long time for it.",1
"I visited Ramen Thukpa for the first time and I was really impressed! The lunch special is really affordable and there are a lot of choices, including vegetarian and vegan options. I chose the Dan curry noodles and they were really spicy, which was perfect for me. The atmosphere is modest, but it's not a problem because the food is so good. I'll definitely be back to try the Tibetan momo!",1
"Really solid, traditional, red-sauce Italian fare in the heart of the West Village. The menu isn't as adventurous or expansive as other Italian restaurants in this neighborhood but I don't think anyone ever left here dissatisfied. First, the green salad was perhaps the best I've ever eaten and yes, I realize how basic that makes me sound. This blew Via Carota's version out of the water. I could definitely eat this every day. Portion was big enough to share between two people as an appetizer and paired really well with the entrees. The pastas are definitely the thing to order here, as indicated by how little real estate on the menu was devoted to non-pasta options. (Also, if you're coming to any Italian restaurant, it should be a cardinal rule that you order at least one pasta dish.) I ordered the garganelli verde - good meaty sauce, not so heavy as to make you want to unbutton your jeans and waddle out of there. I had a bite of my friend's lamb agnolotti, which was a bit too rich for my taste. Also had some of the Parmesan veal - I highly recommend eating this first as soon as it's brought to the table, because the sauce and the cheese congealed a little after it sits for a while. Ample outdoor and indoor seating. Really cute bar area right as you come in that would make for a good date spot.",0
"Porteno is a place that benefits from Sleep No More foot traffic (read my review of this incredible show here: yelp.com/biz/sleep-no-mo… You may see randos coming in with theater masks; that's Sleep No More clientele trickling in! It's one of the few places open late after the show gets out around 10 or 11 PM.So how is it? Like most foot traffic beneficiaries, it's running on fumes. Chicken breast was pretty uninspiring, could be made at home, and was pretty dry. Best thing was the tuna tartare, but it's hard to mess that dish up. My head definitely didn't (figuratively) explode over anything, including the chocolate dessert.I'd count on making dinner plans somewhere around Meatpacking a little south rather than taking the easy way out after Sleep No More.",0
"I came to Your Local for a quick sushi fix and was pleasantly surprised. The Salmon Supreme was fresh and flavorful, with a nice variety of sushi rolls. The kelp was a nice touch, and the rice was soft and well-cooked. The only downside was that the soy sauce was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise everything was great. The seating area had a nice relaxed atmosphere, and the staff was very attentive. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for a quick and tasty sushi fix.",1
"Did a to good to go order here.  Food was ready to be picked up on the spot. A lemonana drink was included with my hummus and falafel platter, as well as various salads and 2 delicious pitas.  Enough food for me and my girlfriend and the lemonana hit the spot. Will def put this place on my radar in the future.",0
"I had a really nice time at 85 Degree Bakery, and I'm really glad that I decided to check it out. The lemon bread was amazing, and I really appreciate the high quality of the products. I would definitely recommend this bakery to anyone looking for a great Asian meal.",1
"This is a great place for budget-minded diners! I was really impressed with the prices and the quality of the food. The 3-piece meal of meat over rice was only $8, and it was really delicious. It was a bit hard to communicate with the employees, but that's probably because they're so busy. The meat was definitely fresh and smelled amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",1
"great meal but nothing particularly stood out to me! the presentation was beautiful but flavors were lacking. would rate this place 3.9/5 stars - Plantains and pork belly -- plate full of plantains with one piece of pork belly. not worth in our opinion.- Watermelon and pickles -- an interesting dish with great flavor but not a must order. - Drunken deviled eggs -- not a lot of flavor but presentation was great!- Fried chicken -- tasted like normal fried chicken, I think even Popeyes has more flavor.",0
Food was underwhelmingI was very excited to try this placeHonestly forgot I tried the burgers before so got it again and it was not worth it. I thought that the last time I tried it lolBranzino was so good! I love the veggies it came with and everything went well togetherWagyu was so buttery and good but also too heavy. I liked it with the salt. Cheesecake was good! I ordered it since it was my bf bday and it was really nice that it was on the house. I expected to pay but it being complimentary was really niceService was really good but slow. It's cool to try but not sure it's worth the money.,0
"Unbelievably disappointing-- came here randomly for a Sunday HH for very watery martinis and a clumsy, apathetic bartender who tripped and spilled half our drinks, didn't apologize (or give us napkins for the stickiness everywhere), and took 25m to give us water we asked for repeatedly, then offered, acting as though we hadn't ALREADY ASKED FOR IT TWICE. On an empty Sunday.Perhaps will amend IF we ever return, but .. really?! Unbelievable, especially for everywhere else.Really disappointing, since we were really excited about trying the menu. The second drinks came out just as watery- I didn't even finish mine.  (Which is unheard of!!!). I'm really wanting to like this place, but completely off-put by this, and am surprised by the other reviews.Beautiful bar though- hope this was a one-off situation.",0
"The Grey Dog is a great place to go for a delicious breakfast. It's a bit pricey, but the food is worth it. The portions are large, and the atmosphere is light and airy. It's busy, but not too loud. It's very clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed my time here!",1
This Italian restaurant is actually pretty good. They have a good selection of different pastas and even pizzas! They give big portions which fills you up and the pastas are always sauced well. I like their rigatoni funghi e salsiccia. It was rigatoni pasta with mushrooms and sausage covered in a pink sauce. The pasta was just slightly still tough but most of the pieces were good. It caught onto the pink sauce well and there were good pieces of sausage mixed in as well. They also have good complimentary bread that's fluffy and served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar! Definitely recommend trying this place out!,0
"I had a weird experience at this restaurant where our waitress told us at the end of our meal that their card reader doesn't work and if we wanted to pay with our credit cards we would have to do so in cash. This was strange because we weren't informed until we were finished our meals and asked for the bill. We didn't feel comfortable leaving a picture of our credit card and so luckily I was able to carry enough cash. Unfortunately, this is not good practice and I feel like it's shady how we weren't informed until after we finished our meals. Aside from that, the food was pretty good. I recommend getting the tiger shrimp and mushroom croquettes and the jumbo crab cake. I'm indifferent about the experience, but I do think the card situation could have been handled and communicated better.",1
"We had a nice relaxing weekend brunch, with Dave having an omelette, and I the Calamari which was excellent and plentiful. Our waiter was attentive and helpful and I was able to order non brunch items (no eggs for me) which took a bit longer but the amount of calamari rings was impressive. Not sure why others rated so low but it was reasonable, fresh, and tasty.",1
"Located in an area with many brunch options, I'm glad Dutch Fred's takes reservations!! The hostess was so nice and accommodating with our seating request. It was so busy on a Saturday at 1pm, but it almost completely cleared out by 2:30pm. I absolutely loved the chicken and waffles, but I wasn't exactly a fan of the sauces. The maple sriracha syrup was peculiar...(and don't get me wrong, I love spicy food, but this combo wasn't it), and the other sauce was thiiiick, sweet and savory. I didn't like either of them, and wish they asked if we had a preference. I loved that they toasted the sourdough, and it paired well with the tomato dish. The bathroom was CLEAN! I sat at the bar and a few of the waiters walking past me whacked my bag a few times, which was distracting (but understandable bc it was so crowded). Would come back again.",0
"One of my all time favorites for Mediterranean and Greek seafood, with the best grilled octopus on the planet. A lively warm atmosphere and delightful outdoor seating make Avra one of my go to lunch or dinner spots in Manhattan. Convenient midtown East location is perfect for business occasions.",0
This restaurant is definitely mediocre. The food was tough and not very fresh. The rolls I ordered were also not very good. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1
"5ive Spice is a great place to go for a delicious Vietnamese meal. The spring rolls are especially delicious and the short rib pho is definitely a must-try. The only downside is that it can be a bit pricey, but overall it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is also really cute and cozy, making it a great place to go with friends.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The pizza is always delicious, and I especially love the thin crust with yummy toppings. Even the cheese pizza is good. I prefer my pizza with toppings, so any of them are delicious. The atmosphere is also really nice and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great pizza experience in New York.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was really good and there was a lot of variety to choose from. The waitstaff was really friendly and the overall atmosphere was really pleasant. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The standout dish for me was the kimchi cream udon. It was really spicy and had a great flavor. The ribs were also very tender and the sauce was really delicious. Overall, I had a really great experience and I would definitely come back.",1
"I was a bit disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The chicken paitan was a bit on the oily side and the soup lacked flavor. The cha siu and noodles were fine, but the kikurage mushroom was also unshredded, thick, and pretty tough. I would not recommend this place based on my experience. The service was great, though.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant during happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. The menu had recently changed, so I was sad that I couldn't get the Cuban sliders, but the restaurant has a great space for groups and some great happy hour deals. I ordered the guac appitizer, which had a bit more flavor than I expected. I decided to go with the regular cuban sandwich, and I was happy I did. It was cooked extremely well and though I didn't love the yuca fries, they weren't bad. The margarita was mixed pretty well and was on the happy hour menu, which was great. Not sure if they have flavored margaritas, but I'll definitely check next time. The service was amazing, and he was definitely attentive and made sure that everything came out quickly, which was great. Definitely a must try!",1
"We have strolled pass this restaurant for the past 3 years and never tried dining there. Today we changed that. It was impromptu for a Friday night  but in spite of having no reservations, they seated us in about 2 min. The place was busy, as it typically is when we have walked by. The waiter was very nice and knew his stuff. He attempted to seduce us with the evenings 3 course Lobster special for $40 but I immediately stopped him since someone (who shall remain unnamed) has a shellfish allergy (kill joy). The meal must go on, therefore we ordered anyway. Bridgette had there Chicken Pot Pie (which was huge) and she washed that down with a regular Mojito which she really enjoyed. I ordered a sausage & cheese individual pizza with  BBQ Chicken slider (2 sliders on the plate). I opted for only an unsweetened Iced Tea since I knew I had to work late tonight. We both enjoyed our meals, our service and the decor. Neither one of us had room for dessert so we didn't get a chance to review the menu. Maybe next time.....and there will be a next time!",0
"I ordered take out from here and was disappointed with what I received. I ordered the Hokkien mee and the Nyonya seafood fried rice. The Hokkien mee was very liquidy and only had shrimp and some pieces of meat with some vegetables. Typically it should contain other seafood ingredients as well. The seafood fried rice had the option of rice that was made in chicken broth which I opted for. It added a nice, different taste but it was very soft in texture. It also included very few pieces of shrimp, squid and maybe some small sliced scallops but there really wasn't much in it besides rice. However, the prices are pretty good and they do give a lot! Maybe the other options on the menu are better and dining in might be better as well so give it a try.",0
We ordered delivery from here and everything was just ok. We had the following:-fried shrimp and calamari: this was very good and I would order this again. The calamari wasn't chewy and the shrimp were a nice size. I also enjoyed the breading that came on the shrimp and calamari. -caprese salad: this was not good and we ended up throwing it out. The tomatoes were hardly ripe and the fresh mozzarella had no taste-pear ravioli: this was good but I would have liked a sage butter sauce rather than a cheese sauce -chicken parmesan: my husband liked it but I didn't. I thought the chicken was kind of tough and it didn't have much flavor-tiramisu: this was very good and I would recommend,0
"Spent my birthday dinner here and it was fantastic! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the portion was just right for me even though it looked deceivingly small. I had the fettuccine tartufo which came with a very generous amount of truffle shavings covering my pasta in a very flavorful butter & cheese sauce. I also was able to try some of the fusilli e manzo which came with small chunks of extremely tender braised beef. Surprisingly the fusilli was the better of the two pastas in both quality and taste in my opinion. The only complaint I had was that the sauce in both pastas were on the saltier side. I opted for the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato for dessert, only wish the gelato came in a separate cup and in a bigger scoop as it usually melts away by the time the chocolate cake gets started with. I will definitely be back for more!",0
"Got their HK Milk Tea (very authentic, not too sweet), fried dough rice roll (fine, a little too strong on the soy sauce but fried dough was nice and crisp still), shrimp and chive rice roll (the shrimp was nice and the texture of the rolls was good, but we personally didn't like the chives and cabbage in it), and fried steamed buns (well fried and very tasty with Condensed milk).Allows dine in with temp check and contact tracing. Cash only",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The blackened fish tacos are still great, and the fresh juices and chopped salad add a nice touch. The prices are also very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"Delicious and authentic food! Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, lots of choice.I recommend the burrata as an appetizer and anything pasta. Know that the gnocchi with pesto is more of a creamy pesto texture than an oily one. Their pistachio dessert is also incredible. It's a layered pistachio cake, an Italian recipe which I've rarely found in US restaurants. Comes with delicious ice cream (caramel type). Perfect for sharing.Good choice of wines as well. The wine is good quality, mostly imported from Italy. Owners and waiters are Italian. Dined in with some friends when the restaurant reopened for indoor Feb 13. It was great! I hope to be back soon to try more of their dishes!",0
"I had a lovely Valentines Day dinner at this restaurant, and it's a great spot for a date or a group of friends. The decor is modern and minimalist, with a night market vibe, and it's small but perfectly cozy. We ordered a few things off the menu, including the army stew, and I really enjoyed it. The stew has a good assortment of ingredients, including sausage, mini dumplings, and ramen, and it's really delicious. The chicken wings were also a highlight of the meal, and they don't use milk in the batter, which is great for people who are lactose intolerant. The bibimbap with pork was also delicious, and it's a very generous serving. The seafood pancake was a bit disappointing, though, in comparison to all the other dishes. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant, and I'll be back for another meal soon!",1
"I came to Skirt Steak with my fiancée on a cold Thursday night. I don't believe they do reservations so we walked in and were seated promptly. The restaurant was half full upon our entry at 6:15 and completely full when we left nearly an hour later. I really wanted to love this place but I have to be honest, I wasn't that impressed. The price point at 29 dollars was good but the food was just ok. The salad didn't taste like much and the steak and fries were not at the quality of the other famous place in town with this concept. We got Brussels sprouts as our add on and it was mushy and did not taste good. Got the carrot cake and chocolate mousse as dessert which we did not think were great and did not finish. The add ons add up fast on the bill and aren't worth the calories. I think this is ok for a casual dinner option but don't expect anything super delicious. I wouldn't come back.",0
"We had a great experience at this restaurant! The reservation process was easy, and the restaurant was quiet and romantic. The food was very reasonably priced, and the wine was great. The steak, short ribs, and salmon were all delicious. The service was great, and we would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Da Toscano is a great spot for unique Italian fare in the West Village. The focaccia and meatballs were both fantastic, but the pastas didn't quite standout as much. The agnolotti was my favorite dish, but the orecchiette and garganelli verde were also very good. The broccoli rabe side was a bit of a disappointment, but overall I had a good time.",1
Came for lunch Saturday afternoon. Thus place is small family run type establishment. Food was decent. We got the lunch special goat with rice. I also got a chicken salad off the appetizer menu. I wasn't a fan. The tangy dressing with an odd flavored chicken. A little overpriced for their small sambosa.,0
"I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The food was overpriced and not that good. The service was good, but everything else was just ok. The wait was quite long, and the food didn't really stand out. I had the BALT sandwich which was just ok. The waffle fries were good, but the main highlight of the meal was the chocolate fondue. I don't think I would come back here, but maybe for dessert.",1
"Came in on a weekday because I wanted my soup fix, and surely I was disappointed. We ordered an order of soup dumplings, and 5/6 of them were popped. So when we ate it, there was no soup in the dumplings! However, the meat filling was good, hence the extra star. We also ordered Dan Dan noodles, and it was a plate of noodles with a SMALL (the size of two quarters) scallop of meat. There wasn't a lot of sauce for us to mix the noodles, and when I ate it, the noodles were really bland. We also ordered the beef noodle soup, which is one of the specials of the restaurant. Super bland, kind of tasted like poorly flavored soap water. I had to add lots of chili oil to make it taste ok. Overall, it can be a great place but maybe I came at the wrong time. It's just not something I would try again.",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The setup was a little chilly, but the staff were very nice. The food did come out at different times, and my boyfriend was left waiting for his dish while I ate. However, the food itself was good - I especially liked the pastry puffs. The rice pilaf was also very tasty, full of flavor and with a textured crunch. I don't think I'll be returning until there's indoor seating available, but overall it was a decent experience.",1
"Although the food was good, the wait for the food and drinks  was really long. I believe we ordered around 6pm and we didn't get our food and drinks until like 6:45pm. Honestly, maybe they were short staffed or something but the food was good quality!",0
"My boyfriend and I stopped into Natsumi Tapas after work on a Friday night and had a great time! The restaurant was decently crowded, but we were able to be seated without a wait which was nice. The service was friendly & prompt. Our waiter came over right away and offered us some drinks & edamame, so we ordered a beer, a glass of wine, and some spicy edamame ($5.25) to start while looking at the menu. There are SO many dishes to select from. It probably took us 15 minutes to narrow down our choices. We weren't super hungry, so we shared a tuna avocado roll ($6.50), crunchy spicy salmon roll ($6.75), rock shrimp tempura ($9.75), and crispy calamari ($8.95) - Everything was very tasty. The sushi was very fresh, and hot tapas were crispy, fried, and yummy. We really enjoyed the spicy peanut dipping sauce that came with the calamari. Our meal came to about $60 w/o tip, which isn't bad for dinner & drinks in NYC and we left totally satisfied.We live in the area & plan to come back again soon to try some of the more adventurous dishes on the menu, like the Asian fusion pasta dishes & meatballs!",0
"We had a fantastic time celebrating my daughter's birthday at Per Se. The food was amazing, and the presentation was beautiful. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. We highly recommend this restaurant.",1
Love the burger - much different than the Luger/Minetta burger in that it's actually manageable to eat and has more going on with it than just a huge beef patty. Bloody was also solid though for $17 I probably could have done without it.,0
"I came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 4 people for my friend's birthday. I've never had Laotian food before and can't really travel nowadays (due to COVID-19) so why not take a trip to Laos (Tribeca haha)? We ordered the pork spring rolls, the chili Brussels sprouts, the chili chicken, the pork belly bowl with rice noodles, and the hanger steak bowl with sticky rice. My favorite dishes were the spring rolls and the pork belly but all the dishes were delicious. The spring rolls came with lettuce, pickled vegetables, and peanut fish sauce which made for a great lettuce wrap. I wish the chili Brussels sprouts were spicier. The service was a bit slow even though the place was not that crowded so I took off a star. I would come back to try other dishes since their dinner menu looked good.",0
"The restaurant had really good overall food. The cauliflower was really yummy, but a bit dry. The cheese rolls were very flavorful and spicy. The lamp chops were delicious and cooked well. The rice they serve it with was very interesting and also super flavorful. The butter chicken was my favorite, but the dish was 70% sauce and 30% chicken, which was a bit too much for me. The drinks were also good, but very expensive. I would recommend this place, but I'm not sure I would come back.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The ambiance was very elegant and chic, and the music was perfect for the setting. The food was a bit on the pricey side, but it was definitely worth it. My favorite dish was the egg and cheese dosa, which was a really delicious and hearty dish. The only downside was that some of the portions were a bit small, and the waitress didn't seem very attentive when we asked for a side of naan. However, overall it was a great experience.",1
"I've been to this restaurant twice now and both times the food was good. However, it's not something that has blown me away like some of the other reviews say it has. The first time we came, we had the roast beef dip sandwich and it was good. Nothing spectacular, but it was good. 

On this particular visit, we got the dip Pithivier. It was good, but it was certainly a lot more hot and melty in the Instagram photos. Sadly, there's no sit down, so it was cold by the time we could eat it. 

We also snagged a few yuzu black sesame donuts. They were really good- flavorful and tangy. Again, very good, but would I wait on another line of 30 folks? I likely won't next time.",1
"Overall, I was unimpressed with Khe Yo. The appetizers were decent, but the main dishes were pretty bland and not very unique. I'm not sure I would come back based on the price alone, though Restaurant Week may make it more worth it.",1
"I had a great experience the first time I came to this restaurant. The broth was flavorful and the noodles were fresh. The calamari was also very hot and fresh. However, my second visit was disappointing. The broth was too cool and the meat was halfway cooked through. Previous to that, my sister and I had ordered calamari and spring rolls as apps. What came out was the calamari-which was still good- and some meat filled roll. Spring rolls are full of vegetables, no meat. But since we both popped one in our mouths and chewed before we realized we just accepted it. It was a grayish kind of meat mix and we were a bit afraid to ask what it was to be honest. It wasn't bad, just not what we wanted. We equated it to language barriers.",1
"The Horny Ram is a great place for American food with a variety of menu items. My favorite thing was the Korean Steak Sandwich which was really tasty and had a unique flavor. The portions were also decent for the price. The service was also quick and friendly, and the outdoor seating was warm and welcoming. All in all, it's a great spot for a casual meal.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food wasn't the best Italian food I've ever had, but it was still really good. The highlight for me was the Cacio e Pepe - a cheese wheel served with a sauce. I would definitely come back for that particular dish. The bucatini I got was also better than average, but I usually prefer Italian restaurants that make their own pasta. My favorite part of the meal was the appetizer we got - a meat on crackers with a creme brûlée type sauce to dip it in. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good Italian meal.",1
"I ordered from here again and the pizza was not as good as it was a year ago. The dough was not fully cooked and had a bitter taste. The toppings were also low quality and tasted like microwaved pizza dough. Overall, I was really disappointed because just a year ago this place was really good. Perhaps it's just because of food inflation, but the ingredients have been slacking. I would not recommend this place.",1
"Restaurant Week Lunch 2020 $26 for 2 course. Got salmon tartare and 3 chips that taste exactly like onion chip in indonesia as appetizer, big portion. Nice flavour and presentation . Demi strip steak ( additional supplement $12). My friend was shocked when it's coming because it's tiny. But by the end of the  steak we have trouble to finish it. Don't let ur eyes fooled you. The steak nicely done in medium rare. I also order passion fruit margarita that quite potent for lunch :) and key lime pie to share. The meringue slightly too sweet for me but it's because my keto diet regime that made all the food I ate too sweet. Service is good and very efficient. Total cost $85 with tip. Expensive lunch indeed. I definitely come back to this steak joint",0
"Bolero is a new Vietnamese restaurant that opened in 2020. I'd wanted to come here for awhile, and only finally made it here for lunch last weekend. I had made a reservation for around 1pm on a Saturday. Reservations were easy to come by on Resy, and I didn't have to book very far in advance. They have a beautiful backyard with a caged canary in the back. My friends and I split one appetizer, the pate. It came with some small toasted pieces of bread, and a terrine. I found the terrine a bit bland, but the pate was excellent. My friends both had the beef pho, while I had the clams. The clams were an appetizer, but I got a side of rice, which made it more filling. The broth was fragrant and comforting. My friends both liked their beef pho. Service was pleasant and attentive. Would come back to this restaurant for a great modern Vietnamese meal.",0
"The atmosphere in Pancho's Mexican Grill was pretty laid-back and the place was pretty empty when we arrived on a Thursday night. We ordered drinks and appetizers, and the empanadas were really good. The guac was also really good, with a lot of chips to go with it. We were a little disappointed that they were out of passion fruit margaritas, but everyone else at our table seemed to enjoy their different margaritas. For our main course, we got the ""tour de tacos"" and they were really good. The street corn was also amazing, though the beans looked a bit mushy and old. The service was really good, and we were given free prickly pear shots and glasses of champagne at the end of our meal as a thank you for checking in to Yelp. Overall, Pancho's Mexican Grill is a great place for groups and the drinks are definitely good. The food, while okay, is not anything to write home about.",1
"Tabata Ramen is a great place for ramen soup. The service is good, and the prices are great. However, the place can be a bit dirty, and the bug zapper can be a bit annoying.",1
"Cute restaurant! Small restaurant but tables have a little but more space than most nyc restaurants. We tried to 3 course tasting menu. This is a choice of app, entree, nann, dessert and rice and lentils are included. It's a lot of food! Mango cod and banana leaf chicken were really tasty. Only downer was we didn't care for our desserts. Odd flavors, maybe just not our thing? We tried the tart and chocolate mousse. Service was nice but a tad slow. Had to ask for water refills, the dessert menu and the check.",0
"This was during COVID 19 delivery.  Best packaged delivery I've received!  Arrived in perfect condition and quickly.  I ordered spicy basil chicken, which was pleasantly spicy and full of grilled veggies.  I also ordered Thai spring rolls, which were hot and crispy.  The chicken curry puffs were my favorite!  Seasoned so well, light flaky outer crust, delicious!  The sauces with the spring rolls and curry puffs were both really flavorful.  I also got spicy potatoes, which were good, but they were in a thick sauce and not my favored texture.  I did love their Thai iced tea.  I would definitely try this place again!",0
"Overall, I really liked this restaurant. The empanadas were some of the best we've ever had, and the prices were definitely reasonable. I only had a few complaints - the ground beef empanada was a bit too filling for my taste, and the Greek spinach pie wasn't my favorite. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"If this was based solely on food, I would rate it higher however skirt steak really needs to find a good system for tables. Right now everyone just waits outside of the restaurant. We got there right at opening and waited for 2 hours in the cold. The line didn't look that long but I assure you it is deceiving. There were also a bunch of open tables in the restaurant that they didn't seat despite the line. The most frustrating part about it was waiting in the cold and seeing certain people get to skip the line completely. Must have happened 3-4 times even though ""they take no reservations"". Felt like they didn't really care about the customers that were standing in the cold waiting to get in. Feeling like this ruined the experience a bit, as everyone was frustrated by the time we finally got a table. The steak was good but they don't offer medium rare.... You have three choices-- well done, medium or rare. Drink menu was limited as well as the sides. Everything tasted good. The steak and spinach were definitely the stars. I think it was definitely worth the value but not the wait.",0
I visited this restaurant based on the good reviews I had read online. I was not disappointed! The pizza was delicious and the service was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.,1
"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Loring Place. The staff was unyielding and not at all welcoming, and our reservation was almost canceled because we arrived 20 minutes late. The food was good, but the prices are a bit high. The space is lovely, but the service let the restaurant down.",1
"PROS:1. Two levels of seating with a bathroom in the back of the first floor. 2. Highly recommend the Joju banh mi, because the pork is flavorful and a fine  balance between savory and sweet. The bread is perfectly crunchy on the outside and really soft on the inside. (The kind of crunchy that doesn't hurt the roof of your mouth!) 3. Lemongrass chicken was okay but I think pork was better. Part of it is because I had some parts that were chewy from cartilage and skin, which I personally do not like   4. They have WiFi it seems, but I wasn't able to connect to it. So not sure if it's publicly accessible.",0
"The food was amazing, but the restaurant could use some work with their presentation. The main dish I ordered was SUPER salty and I couldn't finish it. The side dish I got was also pretty disappointing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some amazing food.",1
"Highlights:Great spot for groups, garden outdoor seating in the back, friendly fast service with okay food There were a bunch of us so we got to try a lot of different stuff. We got:- breakfast taco: cheesy but not great... cant really describe it because it was just... mix of all kinds of flavor. Bizarre is the best way to describe. Won't get it again - chicken swarms taco: dried out chicken, won't get it again - Brussel sprouts taco: awesome alternative to meat tacos. Would get it again! - spicy guac: actually has a bit of heat so would get it again over regular guac. LOVED the crispy fresh chips - corn on the side: it's not on the Cobb, and it has a bit of a kick which I appreciate. For the price, it's probably not enough portion but GREAT flavor. - spicy shrimp: probably the only taco I'd recommend. Overall, ive bad better tacos. It wouldn't be my place to get tacos... but their side dishes were great and the service was awesome. Aside from tacos (what they are known for), I'd recommend the place. Just be careful ordering tacos? I'd say 6.5 Gryffindor points out of 10.",0
"Overall, I didn't enjoy my experience at this restaurant. The pho was good, but it was a bit on the oily side and a bit more expensive than other places I've been to in New York City. The service was sweet and patient, though. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good bowl of pho, but I would not go out of my way to visit it.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was top notch. I especially loved the steak tartar appetizer. It was delicious and came with a Chimichuri sauce on the side. My drink of choice was the Cognac Sangria and it was a great match for the steak. My favorite dish of the night was the creme brûlée, which was crispy on the outside and silky on the inside. I definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great night out.",1
"Great addition to UWS! I love Thai/fusion food so this was a great experience. Rather difficult to get a reservation so book in advance! The drinks are ok, but very pricey for what they are. I ordered the roti canai which is phenomenal and I strongly suggest it to anyone. I ordered the haianese chicken, the bee red and, and my fiancé the pad se ew. He loved his dish saying it was the best he had ever had at a restaurant, which for him is high praise given that he orders it every time we go for Thai food. The table favorite was the beef redang! Definitely stole the show, the curried beef was incredibly flavorful and packed an impressive first punch. The Haianese chicken, significantly less so. I was surprised at this given that my mother makes this dish fairly frequently. The chicken did not have much meat on it and the flavor was significantly lacking. It honestly tasted like bland chicken with a crispy exterior. The rice was ok, it was seasoned but didn't work well with the provided chicken. The saving grace of this dish was the soup -- which was hot, salty, and well flavored.Overall, order the noodle dishes and the beef redang, but skip the Haianese chicken and the drinks.",0
"I always enjoy going to BBQ's, and I was happy to see that they still have indoor seating if you have your vaccination card. The Henny wings, hot wings, cornbread banging shrimp french fries, and a side of alcohol make for a great meal. I got the Gucci Royale and it included two types of Long Island Iced Teas and a margarita, plus a small bottle of Brut and an extra shot of Henny. The service was good, and I didn't feel rushed but was attended to often. I can't wait to come back!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The bartenders were super friendly and chatty, and the drinks were delicious. The only downside was that they charged me for my drink, which I found a bit strange. But overall, I enjoyed my time here.",1
"Chloe at peaceful Soho was delicious as always, but it was crazy inside the restaurant. It felt like a mad house, and I haven't gone back since. The light meal we had was refreshing and addictive, and I especially loved the quinoa salad. It was different from any other lemonade I've had, with a minty cucumber flavor that we loved. Compared to the Soho location, this place had more open space and was quieter. It's perfect for everyone, with little coloring books and crayons for the kids and healthy meal options for the family. The only thing I would say is that the tables need to be kept clean more often, and our food needs to come out faster.",1
"Grandma's Margherita Pizza is absolutely amazing! The crust is fantastic and the sauce is a lil sweet, in a great way. The cheese is always fresh and the delivery is always on time (or early). The carrot cake is also delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"The restaurant is very intimate, and the service is wonderful. The omakase experience is great value for what you pay, and the sake pairing was excellent. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, and the people we met there were very interesting.",1
"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! The decor is beautiful and very authentic, and the waitstaff is so friendly and helpful. The food was great, and I especially loved the rendang beef entree and the fish panna cotta dessert. I can't wait to visit again!",1
"Churutto is a delicious, affordable ramen restaurant with a refined and comfortable atmosphere. The menu has thoughtful choices around what to order, and the bowls of ramen were all delicious and hit the spot. Prices are fair, running $11-$16 for a bowl. I highly recommend Churutto for a simple, delicious ramen meal.",1
"We came here for a week day lunch. We got dan dan noodle, steamed eggplant with pickled chili, double cooked pork, and fish stew and tofu. All came out fast, fresh, flavorful, and with reasonable portions. My favorite was the steamed eggplant - the sourness and spiciness worked together beautifully. My only small complaint, and this is absolutely personal preference, is that the dishes were not spicy, even the fish stew that had spicy signs on the menu tasted mild - by no means was it bad, I just wished it had a little more of the ""numbing"" taste.  Overall, the food, the decor, everything reminded me of Cafe China, which is now about a block away. The service was better. Plum juice was delicious. Will be back.",0
"I'm so glad this place opened up in the neighborhood! I made a reservation over the phone since I was afraid the seating would be limited, and I was not mistaken - the experience is very much like Kazu Nori. You can select sets or ala carte and the rolls are freshly made (they serve you one piece at a time). The space is spacious, but seating is limited with stools along a wraparound counter. I ordered the smallest set and added some ala carte items. The ingredients were pretty quality and my favorite was definitely the crab. I will be returning to this neighborhood gem!",1
"I was disappointed to learn that this restaurant and its siblings have closed. I was a fan of their meat pies - they were my go-to when I wanted something hearty and filling. Unfortunately, there are no other decent meat pie options out there, so I'll have to find another place to satisfy my cravings.",1
"I was too busy on a work call to realize my coworker took me into the wrong restaurant but maybe it's the same owner ! I wanted to go to Tavola  ( next door). Nonetheless, the food was good but that mixed with the environment, it just wasn't the vibe that I wanted or like! Best part was the modern top 40 music!",1
Went here for brunch and it was a brunch party. The dj was really good and the drinks were strong. The menu disappointed a little for me. Nothing on the menu seemed worth the price and even as I looked to my right and left the food didn't look that great. We ended up just drinking and enjoying the music. Might have to come back when it's not brunch for the full menu. Good bartenders tho!!,0
"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant based on the good reviews, but my experience was not great. The menu was limited, and I ended up ordering a $20 beyond burger. The burger itself was decent, but I had better Impossible/Beyond meat burgers for less than that. The salmon in my Caesar salad tasted as if it was just cooked, not seasoned. The best part about my meal was the fries, which were delicious. The service was cool, but this restaurant just didn't live up to my expectations.",1
"Super cute restaurant with nice ambiance. They have some outdoor seating and very ample indoor seating. Came here with some high school friends for a catch up sesh and everyone seemed to enjoy their food! The waitress highly recommended the crispy sweet onions $15 and mentioned that people come here just for that, so of course we had to get one for the table. It's basically like onion rings, but rather than rings, it's larger squares of onion. It was really good, especially paired with sauce that comes with it! Comes out nice and fresh.For my entree, I went with the Fusili $24, another recommendation from the waitress. The fusili they use doesn't look quite like what I've seen usually, it's a lot larger and longer. More chances for it to catch some of the sauces and ingredients in the crevices i guess haha. It was good but I think it got a little heavy near the end, maybe it needed some acid. Didn't get to try their pizzas but that'll be on my list for next time!The staff was also extremely accommodating when I passed along that one of our guests would need to fit a stroller somewhere. Thank you guys!",0
"To sum it up in two words: mediocre and overpriced. If either the service or the food was decent, I could give an extra star, but this food court stall failed at both for my experience.  We decided to give this place a try for the first time because we wanted some simple boonsik. It was already a red flag when we noticed that this was the only stall with no customers. But even with no customers, it had to take some time to grab the attention of the workers. We ordered the set E of cup sized ddukbokki + soondae, along with a separate order of odeng (fishcake). Right off the bat, we noticed that the displayed ddukbokki and odeng didn't look fresh. It seemed as if they were sitting outside for hours, but the worker insisted it was okay. All three of the dishes were OK. Not completely terrible, but nowhere near good...However, considering the price ($25) for mediocre, SMALL portioned food, it isn't worth getting again. Everything tasted like frozen food. The soondae was clearly frozen packaged soondae, with the skin completely peeled off (?!), while the odeng tasted grossly artificial like the frozen packs you get at Hmart. The soup was the only decent part of the dish, but we had to reheat it due to how lukewarm it was. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone craving Korean snack food.",0
"Overall, I wanted to like this restaurant a lot, but the small space and greasy sandwich made it difficult. The sweet potato fries were a saving grace, but I wasn't impressed with the eggs or the mushrooms. My friend had a better experience with her matcha lemonade and oj. I'm curious to try the other items on the menu, but I don't think I'll be returning.",1
Was in a rush and ordered from here for a friend and I. Never been before and saw it had a delivery option so we decided to give it a try. It is fantastic! We got a salad and pasta with mushrooms and sun dried tomato in a cream sauce and both were really good. Super fast delivery also! Definitely recommend if you're in the midtown area!,0
"Benny's is a great spot for vegan and gluten-free diners! I had a spinach burrito that was really tasty and went well with the sauce they provided. The other diners in our group seemed to enjoy their meals as well. The drink I ordered, a Mexican mule, was strong but delicious. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I don't usually write bad reviews unless I have nothing good to write, however Had a reservation at 5:30 for early dinner but came here even earlier and of corse it was empty. Our server was nice. But the salmon I ordered medium rare was over cooked, cauliflower was very dry and overall not much flavor. Very disappointing. Then while I was eating they took my friend dish dish away as soon as he which I really don't like, because I feel I am rushed to finish mine. Then we ordered a dessert to share. As soon as we finish they dropped a check. It was only 6:30. This is extremely rude to do without asking a check. Basically they are telling us to leave. We were not rude to them and I didn't return or complain how bad the salmon was which I should have. I haven't had this experience for long time. I understand if we were there for hours not ordering anything after meal and sitting around. We had a dinner then kicking us out as soon as we finished dessert is not right. The restaurant was just starting to fill, but this is not the way to treat customers. Left me bad impression. I am a neighbor and came here once sat at the bar long time ago and hoping i would enjoy the meal. I guess they don't want me to come back.",0
"As an egg lover and somewhat of an anti-breakfast girl (unusual combo, I know), Egghead was everything this Maryland mamicita needed on her fast-paced NY biz trip. I visited Egghead at least 4x while staying at Hotel Moxy and ordered the Basic (I'm not a basic chick, I promiseeee) and the Classic (which really wasn't 'classic' at all, but ok y'all). Both menu offerings were delicious and made-to-order, which I loved. As an anti-fan of 'breakfast sandwiches' that are made in under 60 seconds, Egghead earned four stars for me for the fresh production alone.Admittedly, I probably visited this place so many times because it was right by my hotel, but it was still the type of place I'd happily visit if it wasn't. Prices here are cheap, and the food is consistently delicious...definitely a good place to stop by for a quick, yummy breakfast in the city.",0
"Restaurant is very familiar and staff very friendly. Came in a Sunday for late lunch and the restaurant was very quiet with only a couple of tables esting in.Lisa, the owner's daughter was very friendly and welcomed us. It seems that they took over the restaurant from the previous owner and kept the original menu but also now was about the time to start introducing new dishes (both from the other restaurant they own in midtown and new recipes!)The restaurant is super toddlers friendly and everyone was very nice. About food, we had 3 dishes1. DIY lettuce wrap with stir fried chicken with chinese chesnut. Good and tasty, i don't like chinese waree chesnuts but together with the lettuce it gave the dish the perfect crunch. I would say thought that this is more an ""americanized dish""2. Their famous bbq ribs. Absolutely delicious3. Soft tofu with salty egg. This is is a very chinese food that we really loved! I must say that there maybe people who might not be used to the taste but since I've grown up eating real taiwanese-chinese food it was good for me. My hubby is Caucasian and also like it. here the ky thing I left were the small shrimps, i never like the fishy taste they had. Presentation might not be the best but I am sure they will improve.I think 4 stars is fair given that the restaurant is in the UES.",0
Weekday night still pretty packedWe came here for Korean bbqOver all the taste is pretty goodService was okay But the meat quality i feel is not as good as before But still on average side,0
"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in LES. Pizza was great obviously, but the kale salad was out of this world. Drinks are also very good! Cannot wait to go back again!",0
"I had been keeping my eye on this space when I heard that it was going to become an Indian restaurant. i had passed by the other night [it was already closed] but saw their sign for the all you can eat buffet for $17.95 from 11:30 to 3:30 daily. I stopped in for lunch the other day. It is a large square space, nicely decorated. There was a family of 6 on one side and a couple on the other. I sat in the center. I told them that i wanted the buffet and my water glass was filled and I went to see what awaited me at the buffet. i got a dish and the choices were significant. Basmati rice, daal [black lentils] kadi pakada, saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, a lamb and peas curry and a vat of tandoori chicken. I was looking for naan but they said it came to the table. I began eating and the food was very good and tasty. It did take a while for the naan to arrive and the tandoori chicken was a bit dry but otherwise tasty. The waiter and staff were very helpful and accommodating. It may be a little pricey but the food was good and it is probably comparable for the area. I would recommend and return.",0
"Overall, I thought this restaurant was decent. The service was mostly good, but the wait for my drink was not ideal. The food was good, but the steak and scallops were salty and I found it hard to finish. The experience was more exciting if you order hibachi, but I would still recommend trying this restaurant out.",1
"This place was pretty good. I had the pork belly and lamb bao that came with 2 baos each and they were really flavorful. They have beer that is cheap, relative to the area. They even have the Thai beer that I like in bottles. I love the open concept kitchens and sat right at the bar. I was a pretty bummed about the chicken nuggets. They and the sauces it came with weren't very flavorful and I felt like I paid for over-priced McDonalds chicken nuggets. (Would have even preferred those)The different baos and chicken nuggets didn't quite fill me up as expected for the amount I paid. I probably would have been more full if I got the ramen. I saw they use the same pork belly in the ramen as the baos.",0
"I had a good time at Neta, especially thanks to the great food. However, the service was okay and the prices were a bit high. I would definitely come back, but only for dinner.",1
"Friend of a Farmer has been on my bookmark list for quite some time now. Finally got around to trying it yesterday for brunch. My friend and I walked over without a reservation and ended up waiting about 20-30 min in line for a seat. Being that it was a walk in I do not think that it was that bad of a wait time. We were very content with our seating (outdoor with heaters). Our waiter was very prompt when helping us with our needs and bringing out our meals. We started off with the complimentary cornbread with apple chutney. It was so great, tasted like an apple pie. We both ordered the farmer's market omelette. Hands down the best omelette I've ever had and the potatoes were flavored so well. We will definitely be returning soon.",0
"I really enjoyed the Benedict Johnny at this restaurant! The combination of the cheddar cornbread, maple chicken sausage, and poached eggs was really delicious. The home fries were also a perfect little bite-sized goblet of nicely seasoned crispy goodness. The only downside was that the wait at the door was quite long, but it was definitely worth it in the end!",1
"I recently visited Selena Rose and was pleasantly surprised by the food and drink options. The margarita pitchers are a great value, and the food always tastes great. The only downside is that the service can be slow and disorganized at times. Overall, though, I'd recommend Selena Rose for a casual night out with friends.",1
"We had a great experience at this restaurant! The kori sukka was cooked to perfection and the srikhand dahi puri was lovely. The rampuri taar ghosht was also fantastic, and the garlic naan was fresh and delicious. The only downside was that the baby friendly bathroom was not very accessible, and it was difficult to change the baby. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
I wanted to go to this place since I always love to eat chicken sandwiches. I ordered the hot honey chicken sandwich. It is my first time coming here. It is super classy inside. There wasnt anyone there when we went. I got it for to go and while we were waiting for the food they served us cold water. I am very pleased. Food came super fast and the staff were nice. The hot honey tasted weird but in a good way. I couldnt stop eating it.,0
"This small restaurant felt like a small home built solely of wood. At first, it gave me a Japanese vibe, but then my cousin said it right. It felt like we were at Ikea, which made sense as this was a Scandinavian place!We had the soju cocktails. They were reasonably priced and tasty. We loved our apps. We got the chicken pate that came with toasted rye and pickled squash. The combination of the chicken pate and pickled squash was delightful. The toasted rye was a little too oily. We also really liked the whitefish tostada. For our entrees, I got the green cous cous. It came with cous cous in a dill sauce with pickled carrots (yum!), sweet potatoes (delicious!) and beets (yum!). I felt that the cous cous needed a bit more salt. We also tried the meatball entre. It was very good! I would definitely get this again. The hangover sandwich was great as well and so was the side of potato salad. We would've given this a 5 star, but we had mixed feelings about the danish hot dog. We felt that the bun was over buttered so it had a significant buttery after taste that overpowered the other components. Definitely coming again! The service was impeccable too!",0
"I recently visited Pepe Giallo and had a great experience! The restaurant is small but quaint and the food was fantastic. I recommend the calamari - it was very light and came with zucchini, which was a nice touch. The pasta options are also great, with all of them being homemade. I especially enjoyed the pappardelle with spicy tomato sauce and the fettuccine with mushrooms. Overall, a great experience and I'll definitely be back!",1
"Stopped in last night with a girlfriend, during a torrential rainstorm.  We chose it mostly for the proximity to the subway.  Not your typical Chinatown dive, this restaurant's interiors and menu offerings aim to convey an elevated rarified version of NYC Cantonese.  One look at the menu, and you see all the buzzwords of haute cuisine with prices to match: black truffle, matsutake, wagyu, sea urchin, foie gras.  You get the idea. My friend and I ordered the usual comfort food hallmarks of the Cantonese menu - the roast duck as appetizer and shrimp lo mein.  We were soggy and sweaty messes and were definitely undeserving of black truffle or foie.  We added the okra with black garlic for the fiber.  Overall impression was, better than I expected, but with sky high sodium levels. The Lo Mein, while tasty, was bare bones, with just some scallions in addition to the small shrimp.  The duck was actually done pretty well, with a nice texture and little fat. The black garlic was a nice complement to the okra, but I felt that left whole, the pungent flavor of the garlic cloves overwhelmed the vegetable. Slicing them would have been so much better for the dish.  It was also overly salty.  Luckily for us, the waiters appeared at our table every 10 minutes to refill our tea.  Yes, if anything, service was definitely better than at your average Chinatown joint.We were not offered the complimentary dishes or dessert mentioned in the reviews.  I guess we didn't meet the spending limit?So the verdict? I'm not sure how I feel about returning to order haute Chinese dishes from a restaurant I feel lukewarm about.  It was not bad, but it was not memorable for the prices they demand. I'll probably stick with NY Noodletown, with its gruff waiters and grimy interiors for now.",0
"I ate at Electric Lemon twice. Once for dinner and another time for breakfast. The food was alright but they definitely deserve 5 stars because the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. For our dinner reservation, I looked online and there were no last minute availabilities. I figured I'd go down and just ask in person and they were able to squeeze us in.When we arrived, later that night, the hostess remembered me and I didn't even have to say anything about the reservation. I had the duck and it was really good. Other than that, I liked the oysters and the rest of the appetizers were just okay.I also ate here for breakfast, which was solid, but nothing special. The beet yogurt looks interesting and it's hard to describe the flavor, but it's good!",0
"The Hummus Place had a great small restaurant vibe and the staff was friendly. Our orders arrived quickly and the food was tasty and fresh. I really enjoyed the falafel sandwich in a pita - the fresh veggies and fries made it a great meal. The lemonade was also really good, not too sweet or tart. Overall, a great little spot with tasty food.",1
"The takeout we ordered from our local restaurant was quite tasty and intriguing. The octopus pasta was particularly seafood-y and had a great flavor of octopus. Although the pasta looked and felt dry, each bite was intensely perfumed. The chunks of octopus meat nestled perfectly in the shapes of the pasta, which was funny. The sweet Italian pork sausage was also excellent, with the fix-ins including these delicious sauteed greens (friarielli napoletani?) and rosemary roasted fingerling potatoes. The two stumpy little sauces tasted strongly of fennel and brought me back to those street fairs downtown where the Little Italy stores line up and serve similar-tasting sausages with peppers and onions on a roll. It wasn't the best taste memory, but I didn't mind it. The order also came with six slices of bread, half of which tasted like cranberry walnut.",1
"Last night was such a disappointment.  We ordered a regular pizza, a vegan pizza and an arugula salad to be delivered.  The regular pizza was just okay.  The vegan pizza was fair.  Neither pizza had much cheese on them and it was annoying that they weren't labeled so we had to taste them to figure out which was which.....  not easy, and not good for the vegan who didn't want to mistakenly eat the wrong pie.  We had asked for the cheese and dressing to be on the side for the arugula salad.  The dressing was on the side but the cheese was not; it had to be picked out so the vegan could also have some.  It was also a tremendous disappointment; it was just a container of arugula, the cheese (infuriatingly on the salad already), 3 olives, and about a tablespoon of chopped red onion.....  we had to dig through the arugula to even find the few little pieces of onion.  Crazy expensive for just a bunch of lettuce and 2 mediocre at best pies.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant located in the food court in K-Town, and it was pretty good! I ordered a deokbokki and beef bulgogi kimbap, and both were really good. The prices were reasonable, and I like that they have combos but don't have a $10 minimum for credit card. I would definitely come back!",1
"We had a wonderful time at La Grande Boucherie tonight! The outdoor space is very nicely decorated with green plants and it's a perfect spot for big groups, parties, and date night. We tried the Mesclun salad and a cheese plate as appetizers and both were delicious. The cheese plate was especially memorable because of the honey and fruits. For our main course, we decided to try one of the steak for two and it was definitely one of the highlights of our visit! The steak for two had large cuts of lean steak, surrounded by bone marrow and vegetables. The bearnaise sauce and pepper sauce on the side were incredible and a huge highlight for us. Even after the steak we found ourselves still finding other ways to eat the sauce! We also loved the Bordeaux our server recommended to pair with the steak. For dessert, we tried the pistachio bomb glacee and chocolate mousse. Both were chocolate heaven, with the rich, decadent dark chocolate of the bomb glacee contrasted with the light, fluffy mousse. The fresh berries on top were a perfect touch. All in all, La Grande Boucherie seems a truly grand addition to the Boucherie family and certainly one of the most beautiful. We would",1
"*Mealpal Lunch Review*Not a bad Chinese place on a cold winter day. Ordered the sesame chicken via Mealpal. Seamless pick up process. Food wise it wasn't too bad. The dish came with enough rice, chicken and vegetables. The egg roll was smaller than what they previously had. Not sure if they recently revised the sizing or they ran out. Portion wise I approve - I couldn't finish the whole thing, nor was I starving thereafter! Couldn't do this everyday though!",0
I hope to be able to come back and update this review. I stopped here for a drink alone on a hot summer afternoon and got a glass of bubbly and the bao small bite. The bao was uncooked and just plain dough. Loved the service - but was disappointed that they still chose to go ahead and charge me for an uneaten bao. Eh about coming back again!,0
"3.5 stars. Just got delivered a couple of steak burritos. The amount of meat is solid and so are the burritos. They came with a generous amount of rice and little beans, plus guacamole, salsa and sour cream on the side. I'd definitely order again.",0
"I really tried to like this place because service was amazing. However, the food quality wasn't impressive at all. I assume this place is popular because it's conveniently located near multiple theaters and overall just at a popular location. My boyfriend and I got chicken and fish tacos. Chicken taco was just ok but the fish tacos were so underwhelming, bland, and under-seasoned. It was quite disappointing because these aren't cheap tacos. Our server recommended their Carne Asada entree which was in fact disappointing as well. Meat was way too salty and I also had a hard time chewing it. The only good thing that saved our meal were the Chips and Guac--pretty standard. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning. It's definitely a nice place with great ambiance and friendly workers, but the food is way too overpriced for the quality and portion you're getting.",0
"This place was great, had lots of space and were able to take us in right away. The pancakes were my favorite abs the hot chocolate came there really close. The omelet is huge, I mean all portions are so beware of that if you're going by yourself. To be honest, we could've been 3 and ate the eggs and pancakes with berries. Service was great, I even lost my phone for a few seconds and they stopped everything to help us find it. Price was good too, so definitely will add this to my list of must come back when coming to the city.",0
"Finally made it back! We put our name in without a resi around 7pm on a Saturday and was able to sit 45min later (we grabbed a drink up the block) which worked out perfectly.Decoy is currently closed, but RedFarm which is upstairs is currently serving their famous Peking duck ($95) and it's a must have!! Be sure to get there early to reserve as they only have a certain amount each evening. We also had to get the pac-man dumplings and pork soup dumplings which are top items at RedFarm. We also tried wok fried green beans - service was good! I'd highly recommend this spot and especially the duck! They also offer delicious cocktails! Love this spot! Always have.",0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at Boucherie. The food was mediocre at best and the service was really slow. The atmosphere was really nice, but I won't be coming back.",1
"The burger was good but the service was phenomenal. I stopped by for lunch solo. The host asked if I preferred a bar seat or a table. I opted for the table (as long as it didn't infringe on their plans for the day) and he seated me at a table without hesitation. I ordered a single burger with bacon and egg, as recommended by my server. I got the burger pretty quick and realized it was missing both the egg and bacon. I mentioned to the waitress just so that I wasn't charge for the additional items. She came back a few minutes later and said that the burger was on the house. Completely unnecessary but a welcome rewar that doesn't happen too often. The burger was really good even without the egg and bacon, too!Other places could learn from Au Cheval.",0
"Stopped in here on a whim after a Chinatown shopping trip and I'm glad I did! Ordered the drunken noodles (pad kee mao), the lemongrass skewers, and a Thai iced tea. Favorite was by far the lemongrass skewers- cannot recommend enough. It was perfectly seasoned and incredibly juicy (I suggest getting the chicken; the pork was good but it was the chicken that really stood out). Thai iced tea was really good too. Drunken noodles were very flavorful and the seasoning was great, it was just...significantly spicier than I was expecting (and I consider myself to have a medium spice tolerance). I mean if you love spicy food, by all means go for it; it's just that depending on how well you handle spicy food, it might cause you to feel that your mouth is on fire.",0
"I'm pretty much a regular here in summer time. Honestly,  inside doesnt vibe with me, it's just a regular bar. But in summer, you can sit outside while enjoying really good scrambled eggs with mushroom. I can have that dish every month and wont be tired. The toast is a high quality as well. Perfect sourdough that makes your soul happy. They pair the dish with arugula salad and it's just one of the greatest combos ever.",0
"Victor's Place is a great spot for drinks and dinner. Victor is a gracious host, and the food is fantastic. I always enjoy coming here.",1
"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with our group of 4 and ordered papaya salad, a diversity of noodles and calamari.The food was decent and delicious, the portions were generous and I would say that this is a neighbourhood staple for Thai food. The food wasn't on the sweet side of Thai food, if that's what you're looking for. The prices were fair and the waitress was friendly. The service was fast and efficient. Would definitely come back!",0
"The food here was good, but I didn't love it. The scallop skewers were my favorite dish, but I've had better Thai in the city. The pad thai was good, but the panang curry was average and the kea mao was way too salty for me. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and our waitress was excellent. They even combined two tables to give us a little more space on the table which was thoughtful. I didn't feel rushed at all. I may come back to try the fried rice, but overall I think I'm going to stick to my usual Thai spots.",1
"Service was fast and friendly. Food was good but nothing I would crave on a regular basis. Got Roti Canai, Prawn Mee, Kari Ayam (chicken curry). The roti was flakey but didn't pick up the curry dip well, as the curry was a bit too runny. The Prawn Mee tasted singularly of only shrimp paste. The chicken curry was fall off the bone tender, but was a bit too strong on peanut butter. Prices are cheap for the portion sizes, which are pretty big (everything came out to $35 pre tax/tip).",0
"A bit overpriced (figures though being the only place around the statue). Expect to pay $9-$13 for a burger with a side. DO NOT get chicken tenders. Hard and not that good. Side salad is ok- you're better off getting one of those refrigerated salads by the sodas if you want salad. Would recommend: -New Yorker Burger (meat is tender, pastrami is good) -Fries (very tasty and crispy crinkle cut)",0
"I was happy to find that they delivered to my workplace, and ordered the roasted garlic cauliflower mash, small size 12oz. I also ordered a couple drinks and the grass fed meatball plate with roasted Brussels sprouts and pesto spaghetti squash. Delivery arrived a little late but maybe they were busy.

The roasted garlic mash I ordered spicy and it was. Had a nice heat to it. Not like mashed potatoes!! It was more soft/liquidy than mashed potatoes. Cauliflower contains more water. So texture is similar to baby food in a jar lol. The garlic flavor was light. It was good! It's worth it. $7.50

The grass fed meatballs I ordered spicy too but they were not. It's ok cause the flavor was good. I like the fresh tomato sauce and capers. The Brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted. Tasted fresh. The spaghetti squash was also cooked perfect and the pesto was a light flavor too which was nice.

I would definitely order again from here and I'm pleased with the cold drinks I ordered too. Both good. I recommend this place! Yummy fresh food.",1
"I was hesitant to try this place because I'm a huge Chicago fan, but I'm so glad I did! The thin slices are about the size of my forearm, and the pan is as big as my whole hand. The line for pizza never stops and they are constantly making fresh slices and pies. They have free delivery, and dine-in seating with plexiglass separating each booth. Both Andrew Zimmerman and Anthony Bordain have visited and eaten here, and they both said it was really good. I usually finish eating before my friends, but this time I finished before they did! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good pizza.",1
"I don't really care that it's considered a tourist trap because I love their pizza!During my first trip to NYC, I had Joe's two days in a row. It was that good. You have to understand NY-style pizza though and I can see how some people may not love it (say, if you're from Chicago and a deep dish fan). The crust is super thin and the toppings are light. Since this location was near my hotel, it was convenient to swing by right as they were opening for no wait time at all. I have returned around dinner before and experienced the typical line, but as others have said it does move fairly quickly, for a reason - the service is not friendly. They're all about speed here, so don't dilly-dally! That's where I took off a star, otherwise this joint is a solid 5/5 for me.The supreme is my favorite because I love a mix of meat and veg in my pizza, but you can't go wrong with a caprese or fresh mozz either. When I make pizza at home, Joe's is what I strive to achieve. With all the locations around, I recommend making the stop for a slice. Note that like many other shops in the city, there is limited seating.",0
"I had a pretty disappointing brunch at this restaurant yesterday. The food was bland and uninspired, and the service was lackluster - our drinks were below average and the waitstaff wasn't particularly attentive. Overall, I'd say this spot is not worth your time - there are much better brunch spots out there.",1
"The new two bridges diner is not the same as the old two bridges diner on the corner. The menu seems to have been redacted and no longer include the old breakfast platters. The bacon egg and cheese on a roll which is a new York City breakfast classic came with very thin and overly done bacon. The roll was rubbery and did not hold up well. For comparison, I had the bacon and egg sandwich at the old diner and it was much better. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"pierogis were so good!! recommend the sauerkraut and mushroom ones theyre surprisingly really good & also ask for applesauce on the side for the latkas it makes the experience much better :) fav part was def the pierogis tho they remind me of dumplings fr. just a little heftier than a dump. a hefty dump . i will say tho that the waitresses were like nonexistent like dont get me wrong i like that they are no bs and they just take our order and put our food down and leave,, but there was a huge line out the door and there were multiple tables that were long done eating and had a lot of trouble grtting their check / getting it paid so we were literally stuck in this restaurant for 2 hours and spent the last 45 min trying to get a hold of someone to give us a check lol. anyways be sure to bring good company because u may be here for a while !",0
"I had a really bad experience at Cha Chan Tang recently. The chef has changed and the food was really disappointing. The noodles were watery and bland, the chicken was chewy and not brown, and the baked dishes were disappointing. The service was also poor - we had to ask for more water multiple times. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.",1
This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the UES for a fast take out. Their chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce is delicious and consistent. Not to mention the owners are very nice and friendly. I'm so sad I moved away from them and highly recommend!!,1
"I am blown away - this place is amazing. Really feels like home. Unfortunately I visited on my last day in New York but I know where to go in the future. Portions of food are huge and way too filling that you'll likely have leftovers or feel full for the rest of the day, speaking from experience. So many great selections including the unique mac and cheese pancake which I want to try in the future. Instead of opting for the unique options, we stuck to the basics and enjoyed our steak and eggs, fresh berries, chicken and gravy, mac and cheese, and potatoes. Main entrees come with two sides and I thought I had asked for mac and cheese with fries, but the potatoes were also delicious.The portion of berries was very fair in relation to the price, which was surprising. They were great and sweet. I loved the mac and cheese, wasn't anything spectacular but definitely above average. Potatoes were a great side to pair with.Steak and eggs was fairly normal, but again the portion size was much more than expected which meant leftovers! As for the chicken and gravy, I mustered up the appetite to finish it but it did take me a while. I was bloated the rest of the day even after my plane ride. Three solid pieces of chicken was way too much and I will complain they were a bit dry, so I would have liked more gravy. There was not enough gravy for all three pieces but with the mac and cheese, milkshake, and water, it's definitely manageable. Lastly, they have an assortment of shakes and I do want to try most of them so I'll have to return. This time I got the one with a velvet cake on top and they literally put a piece of cake on top so I felt like the price point was fair for a drink and a dessert together. Enjoyed the light, yet chocolately taste of the drink itself before finishing up with a piece of cake. A whole 5 course meal.",0
"This review is for Oceana's outdoor pop up beer garden, West Park - they don't seem to have their own Yelp page.  Finally stopped by for drinks last night.  It was a really nice night and I was able to get seats at one of the communal picnic tables.  There are no servers; you order drinks and snacks at the stand.  The bartender was very friendly (and cute!).  They had live music going.  Their menu isn't huge but I tried two of the beers, the Equilibrium IPA and the Mexican Lager, and they were both really good and refreshing. My friend ordered the pretzel sticks to snack on but they weren't great (didn't seem fresh).  Not sure how their other snacks would be.  I just really enjoyed having drinks there.  Surprisingly it wasn't very crowded being a Thursday and nice weather.  The manager did a good job of kicking out a couple people who were loitering which I appreciated.  I will definitely be visiting here often this summer since I work a couple blocks away.",0
"The Westin Times Square's bar is a nice place to meet up with friends for a drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it. The bar itself is small, and the bartenders are nice but not overly attentive. They only had one beer on tap, which was disappointing. The neighborhood is fine, and the location is great - right next to the hotel's lobby. However, I wouldn't recommend this bar as a primary destination in a night in NYC.",1
"Blue Park is similar to Dig inn . You pick your base , protein and veggies but there are also preselected combos available as well at a slightly better value versus a la carte. I prefer using the latter means as I'm complicated like that . Ended up with brown rice, blackened chicken, carrots some curries flavored cauliflower and various sauces that I can't remember . My meal was not bad at all . I would say though that they did too much with their seasonings . The rice for example was very saturated with what seemed like lemon juice . The sauces were good but would have preferred them on the side as a dip . The meats were cooked very well (tried the chicken and steak) but was a smaller portion than I'm used to in similar restaurants . The veggies were also good except for their kale but got lost in the complexity and non complimentary flavors of the food .    I'd surmise that this restaurant is good . Figuring out the various combos and what works with what is too much work for me though versus a spot like dig inn that has simpler and less bold offerings that usually satisfies the palette . At a lower price mind you...",0
"I had a month-long hankering for avocado toast so when a new Aussie cafe opened up in the neighborhood I had to come try it out. 

My husband got the chicken sandwich and OJ. The OJ came in a tall thin glass with ice, making it pretty diluted for $6 that seems waaack. Fries were super similar to McDonald's which was exciting, but the sandwich was pretty bland in terms of seasoning -- maybe ordering an unhealthy option at a healthy-ish restaurant is not the way to go? idk

I had ordered an egg (+$3) to come with my avocado toast, as did the girl at the table next to ours. Mine arrived without said egg so I asked for the egg to be added and received a side egg, hers showed up with two poached eggs on top :( y u no indulge my egg love sonnyboy, wouldn't come back.",1
"Came here for my sisters birthday for Instagram-able post dinner desserts. They have two locations on the same street - one is full sized and the other is just a small extension that can seat about 6 parties of varying sizes. Coming from the direction of the NQR station the first location that will come up on your left is the smaller extension which we went to. Once you arrive you can join their waitlist on an iPad that's posted in the front of the restaurant OR you can join the waitlist in advanced on Yelp. It took about 15-20 minutes for our party of 5 to be seated after joining the waitlist.We tried a bunch of different items: Golden Toast: This was the table favorite. The honey roast is the perfect combination of crispy and soft. The warmth of the honey cake combined with the cold vanilla ice cream is another perfect contrast. Finally, the fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Definitely my favorite! Matcha Lava: I didn't personally eat this because I'm not a huge fan of matcha, but my sisters loved it. ""Rich, but not too sweet"" according to my mom. Definitely a great dessert for the eyes!Cookie Camp: We weren't a huge fan of this one - it's delicious for a few bites but it quickly becomes way too much too fast. It's super sweet from the brown sugar coating and the chocolate syrup. Bubble Tea: The Matcha Latte flavor was great - probably the best rendition I've ever had. The matcha wasn't too strong and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. The boba was AMAZING. Super soft and fresh. The Taro flavor was pretty disappointing - it tasted like cereal flavored milk (Trix or Fruity Pebbles) and definitely not Taro. Matcha Sunday Special: This was amazing. Pictures speak for themselves! Cookies: We got these to go but they felt soft in the bag!",0
"This is a review for Nerei restaurant's takeout dining experience. It's interesting to experience five star restaurants at home, instead of in person. As COVID cases surge again, we are dining at home. So the question is - how much of a ""five star"" restaurant is ambience versus the food itself ? I really miss sitting down & eating at a restaurant. I love the entire experience of dining out in general. I've heard about Nerai's great food - there are many five star reviews. And they deliver! So I decided to try Nerai - it was delicious! I appreciated the clean & organized packaging. Everything was full of flavor  & very fresh. You'd never know there was a pandemic happening. I look forward to supporting New York's great restaurants like Nerai, even if the only option is takeout/delivery. Thanks for the hard work & excellent food ! Great job!",0
"This review started with a 4 star and now officially a 3 star. It started out good with our Waitress Jenny, got our drinks which was the el Bebe (the small margaritas) they also have el papa and la mama the biggest drink. We were given complimentary chips and salsa and it was actually pretty good, the salsa has a little spice to it which I loved. Then we ordered fish, shrimp and steak tacos to share. Each came with two tacos each so all together we had 3 each which was great. The tacos are small portions however it was good for two to share. My fave was the shrimp and steak, they fish not so much. So we we're finally done with our meal, check came and we split the bill. I had cash and my friend had her card, I factored in 15% tip along with the bill. When the waiter came I told him that I was paying cash and that he was supposed to charge my friend the extra on the card. He comes back she signs then as we're talking he comes back and ask us about our meal and we tell him it was fine. He then ask about the tip and how if the meal and service was good why we only gave $4 (THAT WAS RUDE) especially because I specifically told him what to do and my first didn't even realize he charged her $23 instead of $26. So we said well we don't have cash and that we have no problem giving the tip as we told him what to do before.... it was only $3 (not like we tried to walk out or didn't tip at all) I did not appreciate him coming over and embarrassing us for $3 extra. Anyway he then went and got the old receipt for us to fix it lol SOOOOOO CRAZY. We did and then left. Will I be back hell no especially if someone is going to act like that for $3",0
"My family of four went to park avenue autumn for thanksgiving last year and this year. Last year was awesome- food and service were great. This year, we got to the restaurant at 6 pm and were seated immediately. However, we waited for over 2 hours for our entree. The restaurant was COMPLETELY understaffed and overbooked. Overall would not recommend.",0
"After an appointment in the area, it was time for a late lunch-early dinner. The Thai Noodle House had a lunch special and I was in time for it. It is a small space-maybe 8 tables. Water was brought to the table and a menu along with it. Koi was my server. The menu is divided into appetizers, soups, salads, curry, pan fried noodles and entrees-the last 3 you have your choice of meat, fish or vegetable including tofu.  There are also salmon and duck entrees. There are 12 noodle dishes to choose from and the lunch special is daily Monday-Friday 11:30-3:30. You can also order your level of spiciness. After looking over the menu, I ordered the kay mao noodles [drunken noodles] with shrimp which also came with 2 spring rolls. It was just enough food and I was pleasantly full when I left. Koi was attentive and accommodating and I would recommend and return.",0
"My friends were in town and were looking for a bar that had an ounce of life in it on a Monday night.  When they decided to try this place out, I immediately expected it to be an Irish pub (judging by the name). WELL... I was wrong, because it's actually a dive bar instead.  Got to give a shout out to the bartender Diamond since she actually made the night fun for my friends and I with her upbeat and wild attitude. You have to see this girl on the swings (such a pro).  First time I've seen a bar where you can swing above it and watch people make spectacles of themselves.  The theme of the night had the be SHOTS as the bartender was pouring out shots like it was water.  If feel drinking for cheap then spin their wheel which can get you either a wild shot or a drink for just $5.  There's a pool table in the back which you'll need coins for.  The bouncer was funny and good with my female friends helping them get on and off the bar table as they decided to give the swing a try.I'm sure this place can get wild on some nights and although I really enjoyed the bartenders fun attitude, I doubt I'll be going out of my way to come back.",0
"How have I not written a review on this place yet? I've been coming to Cozy's for like the past 15 years. Just visited yesterday and I'm happy to see that they've weathered the Covid storm. I love how the place looks EXACTLY the same; no attempts at crazy renovations; it just maintains that old-school feel.  Now the prices have steadily risen here but I've never had a disappointing meal here. This is primo quality diner food with large portions. Best matzoh ball soup in the entire city in my opinion. Also, the best diner burger I've ever had my hands on. They are JUMBO for a reason and none of that frozen patty stuff; I recommend splitting a burger platter with someone, as me and my bestie did often, otherwise you're taking half home. Curly fries are on point, so pay the extra $1 for that upgrade. The waitstaff are super friendly. I would honestly say order anything off the damn menu and it will taste good.",0
"I can't believe I've not written a review of L'Express for years – it's such a great diner in the Union Square/Gramercy area. I've been coming here for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and post-drunk feedings for almost half my life, and I've never had a problem with the service or the food. They have a wide variety of wines, beers, and cocktails, so there is something for everyone. The only downside is that it's a bit closed off for atmosphere – but I guess that's why it's open 24/7.",1
"an institution in midtown.  i used to order from PJ's all the time as a bond trader on wall street, and it was always a place to get an amazing burger.  burgers are thick and not smashburgers (ugh...hate those) and are perfectly cooked medium with pink inside.  super juicy, a soft bun, and flavorful bacon and american cheese (if you order the cadillac).comes with a very generous portion of shoestrings.  my one niggle is that the shoestrings are somewhat plain and that there isn't much flavor or seasoning on them, but i treat them as a filler with the burger as the main event.a solid and classic manhattan institution.",0
"This place was easily one of my favorite restaurants on my whole trip! Honestly, I was a little skeptical at first because I wanted to try more NY stuff (ex. pizza, bagels, etc), but my friend really wanted to come here and I'm so glad we did. I actually stayed at The Arlo so it was right downstairs. I saw a huge line outside every day so I knew it was going to be good. Our group ordered a bunch of things to share and they were all bombbb. I seriously don't think we tried something we didn't like. Spicy marinated raw crab is a MUST. It was all of our first times trying this and it was fireee. The crab meat is so fresh and packed with flavor. We also ordered the kimchi pancake, shrimp pancake, KFC, army stew, bulgogi bibimbap, and slow cooked pork. The pork was another one of my favorites as it was super juicy, tender, and flavorful. The army stew was perfect for sharing and literally warmed our souls cuz it was raining that night. To finish off, we got the black sesame ice cream and this was the perfect way to end the meal. Service was very nice. I made a last minute reservation on Resy and I'm so glad we were able to snatch a late dinner slot. Although the place is pretty small, the ambiance inside is very cute with date night vibes. 100/10 recommend!!!! Literally salivating as I write this review and look at the pictures I took.",0
"I stopped by Soho on a Tuesday night for a glass of wine and some meatballs. The bar service was prompt and it was nice to be able to sit in peace and sip my wine. For $20, the appetizer meatballs is a filling portion. Comes with four to a serving with two delicious pieces of crusty bread. The sauce is on point. I don't think I would go out of my way for it, but overall, a solid option in the neighborhood.",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant. The food was fresh and delicious. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy, and my favorite side was the cornbread. My son loved the Mac and cheese. This was a great mother's day gift.",1
"I've been to Craft, but somehow Riverpark escaped my radar for much longer. Glad I finally got wise, because this place is amazing. My boyfriend and I made a reservation for a Saturday night and fortunately the weather was perfect, (it's a bit of a walk from the train/bus). We sat inside because it was a little too windy outside, and we still had a great view from our window table. I started with the secret garden cocktail, which was lovely. As for the food, we shared the radiatore with spiced lamb ragu, roasted trout, smoked magret duck and strawberry rhubarb crisp. Everything was delicious, only caveat being I didn't like the veggie sides that came with the trout. Service and ambiance were wonderful.",0
I just came here for the first time. They didn't have lunch specials but the eggplant parm hero had a very nice authentic Italian flavor and was very fresh. I am surprised because this pizzeria is in the middle of China town. I will be back. The soup and pizza looks and smells good.,0
"My bf and I just found this place randomly. Very very unexpected... I thought it's a small bar in village, but inside is like a huge beer garden. Drinks are so cheap. Spaten Larger is the most classic.",0
"Taim is a delicious, reasonably-priced Mediterranean restaurant. The service is very courteous and friendly. The menu is varied and includes many tasty options for vegetarians, flexitarians, and everyone in between. This one of the very best deals in and around the Flat Iron District, as portions are of a generous size. I ordered the Impossible Kebabs bowl. The ""meat"" was well-seasoned and included an array of aromatic spices. All of the accompanying ingredients--olives, peppers, cabbage, etc.--we're fresh and perfectly complemented the Impossible ""meat."" I also ordered the famous fries. Beautifully cut and lightly seasoned, these fries are delicious and also of a very generous portion. Taim is a great option for anyone looking for a tasty meal, on the healthier side, and that won't break the bank. Highly recommended!",0
We ordered everything off the menu. 1. Cavatelli2. Calamari and clam chowder3. Everything else They also have incredible cocktails. I loved the Paloma and the tik toki and the anjou and the coffee one and the tropical cocktail.,0
"What a let down. As a child of Argentine parents and having visited Argentina tons of times I was excited about this place and the great reviews, which is why I had high hopes. Empanadas are ok at best, lacked any seasoning (we tried 2 different kinds) and had I not doused them in Chimichurri they'd be throw always..that said the Chimi is worth one star on its own...it was the only thing I'd go back for. Our party tried the skirt and the rib-eye (large one) and both were again just ok. Nothing special and had there not been a mushroom sauce to accompany them or the chimi this would be 2 stars. Service was bad, but that's to be expected at an Argentinian restaurant, meat was bland...that is unexpected. Save your money go to a NY steakhouse, leave this place for the tourists.",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at this restaurant during their week-long special. The food was excellent value, and delivery was quick and prompt. The Caesar salad was particularly fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Cozy's is a great diner for anyone looking for classic diner food with large portions. The waitstaff are always friendly and will help you find what you're looking for. The prices have gone up a bit recently, but the food is worth it. The matzoh ball soup is my favorite item on the menu, and the burgers are definitely some of the best I've had. I recommend splitting a burger platter with someone, as I often do, to avoid taking half home. The curly fries are also fantastic, so be sure to order them if you're feeling fancy.",1
"I really wanted to like this place, and maybe they do have good hot ramen soups. I ordered the cold sesame ramen and the fried vegi ramen. The cold sesame ramen was just plain weird, sour, bitter. The fried vegi ramen came undercooked and slimy, but I guess it did improve with some time in my toaster oven.",0
"I usually love this place for pizza, but my last experience was not great. The sauce tasted different, and the pizza wasn't as crispy as I liked it to be. However, the server was very sweet and gave us a 30% discount, so I'm thankful for that.",1
"Not gonna lie, a bit disappointed. Everybody raves about Los Tacos No. 1 But the tacos are overpriced and the place is just so damn crowded I pulled up on a Tuesday night with a friend, the line moved incredibly fast. I was so impressed. With a line out the door, I waited all but 5 minutes. We ordered two carne asada tacos, the cactus taco, an agua fresca, and horchata. I love that the tacos come with all the fixings (salsa, guacamole, onions, lime). And you can ask for corn or flour tortillas. I got flour tortillas. The carne asada was really delicious; tender meat, a little bit of a kick, juicy guacamole, and petite. The agua fresca was refreshing but watered down. I know, it's water but still. My friend said the horchata was good so I'll take her word for it  But what really put the nail in the coffin was the cactus taco. Everybody in the comments said it was good so I took a leap of faith but damn. I fucked up! Cactus was slimy, lacked seasoning, and because it was diced rather than sliced, the texture was just all off for me. I wanted a crunch factor or something to relieve me from this soggy cactus. Relief never came. I simply gave up... I paid about $20 for two and 1/2 tacos and a drink. In new york city, no surprise. But still. Pricey and it's not like it was blowing me away. Plus the fast-paced environment means lots of people crowded into a hot taco shop, shoving their faces on little counter tops. Not great for groups, not enough room. Just quick casual dates or a bite after a long day. But I know my local taco truck can hook me up for half the price.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The chicken tatsuta-age appetizer was excellent, and the seasonal udon was really great as well. The only downside was that the wait was a bit long, but it wasn't bad at all. The service was great and the food came out quickly. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
I'm a fan and a pretty good burger. They are open from Tuesday-Saturday 5:30pm-10 pm. Got the classic Virginia's burger with two sides of fries and Mexican sweet corn.,0
"I visited this restaurant during the Covid-19 pandemic and was very impressed. The jumbo meal came with three meats and three sides, and was delicious. The wait time to receive the food was about ten minutes, and the staff was always super friendly. I especially loved the jerk chicken and rasta pasta, which had a kick without any visible pepper sauce. The mixed veggies (steamed cabbage, green beans, carrots) were also tasty. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for take out, and I'm looking forward to returning soon!",1
We did a pick order! Fresh food! The best fried chicken! Crispy and Juicy! My favorite side was the cornbread! My son loved the Mac and cheese! Great mother's day gift!,0
"This restaurant has some seriously crappy service. I would not recommend it to anyone. The food, while good, isn't worth the hassle.",1
"I stopped by this place late at night and it was great for what I needed. They have a huge deli that doubles as a grocery store, so I was able to pick up some essentials like milk, cereal, bread, yogurt, juice, pastries, chips, peanut butter, jellies, fruits, etc. The food here is not amazing, but it is decent. The prices are reasonable too. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenience store with food.",1
"This place is all over-priced hype. To be honest, I never even heard of Jeju, let alone the fact that it had a Michelin star. My friend suggested this place for dinner and I thought sure, why not? I've never had Korean ramen before. I saw that they are on Open Table, but I didn't see any availability. So we decided to just go at 5:30 on a Monday, because we didn't know how long the wait would be. The place was pretty empty, but it was also pouring, and a 45-degree day in May. I'm sure they're normally a lot busier.To start, we had Toro Ssam Bap (fatty tuna, scrambled egg, tobiko rice, toasted seaweed). I really loved this. They give you this little sheets of seaweed, and you wrap it yourself. The egg was a nice touch. However, this cost $25, and I'm just not sure it was worth it. The appetizer costs more than the main. Speaking of the main, I had the So Ramyun (veal broth, brisket, scallion, pickled garlic, garlic oil. The first few bites were good. I liked the raw beef, and just letting it cook in the broth (same idea as pho). But after a while, it started feeling pretty heavy. The broth is SUPER rich so if you're not into that, you won't like this. The noodles itself were not anything special.Bottom line - don't let the Michelin star fool you.",0
"Lamia's Fish Market is a beautiful restaurant with great service and delicious food. They have a great brunch deal - $35 for an entree and bottomless drinks! We loved that we were able to switch drinks throughout - we tried different mimosa varieties and sangrias. Our food was tasty across the board - I got seafood shakshuka and my friends got the seafood omelette and the salmon with poached eggs. Our waitress was attentive and nice, and when my friend lost her ring, 3 other servers helped her look for it! We were blown away by this experience and immediately made a reservation for a birthday in the summer. Highly, highly recommend!",1
"I came here for brunch once years ago and thought it was just ok and kind of overpriced so I avoided it, but I came back in for lunch last week and holy cow, what a difference. I had the butternut squash tortolloni and it was the creamiest and richest tortolloni I've ever had. Giving four stars because I do still think it's a tad overpriced but I would still order this again as an occasional treat. I ate every bite on my plate and had to resist licking the plate! My friend got the short rib ragu and while I didn't try it to confirm, she said it was very good. Neither dish was very pretty or exciting to look at, but they both got devoured. The covid precautions here were very thorough. Temp checks at the door, they take your info for contact tracing, staff wears masks and doesn't approach your table if yours isn't up (you can take it down while eating obviously but they ask you to put it up when your server comes). Outdoor dining situation was very comfortable and heat lamps kept us warm enough. My food didn't last long enough to get cold!",0
"Wow, really surprised this place is only 3.5 stars!I am middle eastern and the food was excellent - we shared the mezze, the salad, a few appetizers and three fish dishes. Everything was amazing! The cheesecake is to die for...Will definitely be back!",0
"September 2019,Part of Hands hospitality, I've tried their other partnered restaurants such as Her name is Han, izakaya mew, nonono, and soon, Take31. I was also given an opportunity to try their newly opened restaurant called ON, courtesy of the server! I love what they are doing by offering different types of restaurants for different gathering. Cho dang gol is by far my favorite of all because it looks traditional on the outside but trendy on the inside without compromising the traditional taste of korean food; in another word, the original essence is preserved. The servers were friendly and provided banchan as needed (small seafood pancake as one of the small dishes, i was amazed) and the food from kabocha and potato pancake, cod roe omelet (YAS), baby octopus, and grilled bulgogi were all flavorful and delicious. Cod roe omelet is my favorite because it's fluffy and stuffed with cod roe that adds to the texture! I would definitely recommend this place!",0
"And... I am back in a slump.$26 for fairly mediocre food, maybe a tad bit above it. I got the roast duck wonton soup and it was bland, no taste, the duck has no crispy skin. The wonton fall apart easily, floating around in the broth. This is not worth the money, but maybe it is better for eating in than takeout.The spicy beef chow fun has good spice flavor, beef, and noodles, but I think they use MSG in their food to retain the flavor. You have to eat this slow, because you will be in the bathroom for several minutes after this if you choose to move through this dish too quickly. The portion is big, which adds to the value.Cash only.Maybe I said it already. It could be better for eating in than taking this out.",0
"The fruit refreshers here are really good and not too sweet. They're even better with lychee jelly. They also make martabak, an Indonesian dessert pancake, but that is currently not available. They said they are not sure when the martabaks woukd return. I would love to come back to try them when they are available again.",0
"I've eaten here twice, both times we had great dim sum. Loved choosing from the carts, trying to pace ourselves lol. Sticky rice wrapped in leaves FTW! An eggplant dish was a bit oily but so flavorful. Mostly big round tables mean you might eat with other diners. My friend and I enjoyed meeting new people. Prices are good as is the service. Table cloths and cloth napkins add to the experience.",0
"Overall, I had a really enjoyable experience at A Pasta Bar - the service was great, the outdoor seating was pleasant, and the meal was superb.

However, I think that the meal can be a bit too pricey for the portions, with most of the entrees costing ~$30. While I did enjoy my dish, I think that others might find it a bit too rich in taste.

Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend A Pasta Bar to others!",1
"Love this place - we pick up dinner at least once a week or every other week. The vegetables are always delicious and fresh - and dishes are healthy without tasting too healthy.Love the market plate (4 veggies of your choice). My personal favorite are the yuca fries which come w a chipotle mayo, brussel sprouts, asparagus and broccoli.Have also tried the garlic mashed potatoes, tofu, mushrooms and eggplant. Equally enjoyed. Boy loves turkey party for his side of protein - me, tofu or salmon.",0
"The decor in this place is beautiful! It's pretty small but we were seated right away on a Friday night. The strawberry martinis, while strong, were way too sweet with a syrup-y taste. Would not recommend. For food we had the basil fried rice which was delicious. I was surprised to see kow soi on the menu, which can be rare to find. However it was not very authentic, it was basically just chicken Penang curry over noodles. Still delicious though!",1
"Waited on line to score a sandwich from parm and it was probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. I had the roast beef sandwich as part of a special from The Irishman giveaway. I noticed that it was not on the menu, but a few bites from that sandwich are prompting me to come back to this spot for more. I've heard amazing things about the turkey sandwich so that will be my next try.",0
"I came here for the restaurant week and love this restaurant. We went there at 8pm and it was still packed. The interior decoration is fascinating and the vibes is suitable for friends and dating.My and my friends' selections have: 1) yellowfin tuna tartare: The mango sorbet mixed with the avocado and tuna, fresh and delicious! Recommended! 2) crab salad on the avocado toast: Fresh, but not too exciting! 3) steak skirt: the meat is thin but enough for me. The meat is flavored and very delicious! The source on the plate is ok but I ate the steak alone. 4) cream brûlée : the coconut was only on the top. I was not a big fan of coconut, but the eggs in it are soooo good! I will definitely reorder 5) chocolate covered strawberry: besides it is red, nothing to do with the strawberry. The cake and pistachio   cream in it make great! 6) we ordered sangria and frozen rose: both are not too strong alcohol, which are tasty for girls! I will definitely come back and try other seasonal menus!",0
"Been wanting to compare Bilao with a couple of other Filipino places in the city. Nothing compares to nanay's home cooking but when you need a fix of home flavors its good to know where to go. So first is that this is a small place with tables big enough for 2 or 4 inside and out. The Filipino flag on the awning makes it easy to spot from blocks away.My cousin and i came to try as many dishes as possible and we did a darn good job. Crispy pata, kare kare with shrimp paste condiment, garlic fried rice, pinakbet (vegetable dish), calamansi juice and turon. The dishes were a treat to enjoy and the service was lovely.",0
"Okay...is it just us or does everyone have a hard time finding this place?  we walked past it several times before finally finding it. Boy, I'm so glad we didn't give up!  Of all of the amazing places to eat in NY, on this trip, this was our favorite place! Seriously! I'm not even joking. There were so many things that we wanted to try but we decided on the dumplings to start with. These are an absolute MUST! Do not skip out on these. They're $4 and they will be the most amazing dumplings you've ever had. We then ordered the beef noodles and some peanut pocket type things. I can't remember the name.... probably because I wasn't a fan of them but I'm so glad I gave them a try. Those freaking noodles.....wow...I mean really wow!!!! Incredible! Why were they so amazing, you ask? I don't freaking know! Go try them for yourself and then you tell me! I know noodles are basic but not these noodles. Seriously.... the beef that was in the noodles was not my favorite so we just ate the bok choy and the noodles. Those noodles though....:Seriously people, give this place a go. You won't be disappointed!!",0
I visited this place for lunch and I was really pleased with the pork chop over rice. It was a great value and the pork chop was cooked perfectly. The cucumber salad was also a good choice and was a refreshing way to cool off. The shanghai stir fry rice cakes were also a good choice and were very filling. The taro ball taiwanese ice was also a good choice and was really sweet and delicious. The portions were really generous and the restaurant was really quick. I would definitely visit this place again.,1
"First of all, they did a great job with the outdoor dining setup. We were very lucky to be seated right away at lunchtime, probably because it was a weekday. They were very busy so the service felt a bit rushed. Regarding the food, we started our meal with the burrata, which we really enjoyed. Two of us had the steak, which was a bit overcooked but nothing crazy. One person in our party ordered a pasta dish and was very happy with it. I loved the eggplant side, it was amazing with the steak. They also have great espresso :)",0
"Finally decided to wait in the line and grab some delicious vegetarian grub. Honestly, the line moved quickly and we didn't wait long at all to get our food. Quite painless! My partner and I have mixed reviews on the food: he loved the burnt broccoli and the farro salad, whereas for my personal tastes there was something a little strange tasting about both of them. In the other hand I thought the lentils and polenta dish was amazing and the TFT was so freakin' good. One thing we both agreed on was the gelato was a not to be missed addition. Such fun flavors. Pro tip: even for two people, just order one of everything. Many come in small portions so why not try it all?!",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The food was amazing and the service was great. The only downside was that the green beans were overcooked and tasted a bit like canned green beans. However, the cauliflower was delicious and I really enjoyed the lamb pita. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"The restaurant was back in business, but unfortunately it didn't seem to be doing much better than before. The burger I ordered was cold and sitting out, which wasn't ideal. The cost was also quite high for what you got - $15 for a burger is outrageous. Unfortunately, we didn't have much luck finding any alcohol on site, so we stuck to tap water. We won't be returning to this location anytime soon.",1
"3.5 starsFirst time ordered a large Greek salad with chicken and tostones to share..  was really good. Chicken was quite tasty perhaps a bit salty but overall really good salad compared to other places in the area.. Since the the first time was so good, tried a chicken shawarma platter with tostones again. Chicken shawarma was way too salty.. couldn't eat it..we're just not used to eating over seasoned food anymore. The food is great and if we were younger we could prob handle it but this isn't good for his HBP. I'm sure others love this place since the food is great...",0
"Precovid this place had my favorite carbonara in the cityI came here recently and the service was unacceptably slow. It took a little over an hour for us to get our entrees and it was just the two of us. Terrible experience. Can't justify giving a better review if the food took this long, especially if they had a 90 minute table time limit.",0
"La Loteria serves up incredibly flavorful Mexican food that is as delicious as it is fresh. Everything is made to order so they more than happy to adjust the ingredients to suit your personal taste. The different salsas truly provide a range of flavors that compliment any dish. The portion sizes are good, but not huge. The cocktails are terrific as well.",0
"As soon as I walked into Elis Wine Bar last night, I knew it would be a lovely evening. Aside from the restaurant being aesthetically beautiful, the vibe was very energetic and happy - everyone was eating, laughing, drinking good wine and thoroughly enjoying themselves. The service was extremely hospitable and kind, Artur and Elis (the owners) truly went above and beyond  to make my first time at their restaurant very special! I am a seafood lover and Artur made the best food recommendations based on my palate. We started with the oysters and Artur delicately and skillfully prepared and seasoned it for me at table side! I also tried the ceviche and it melted like butter in my mouth lol, it was so delicious! For the entree Artur recommended the Branzino and it was prepared and seasoned to perfection! For wine we had a bottle (or 2, lol) of red, the L'Atto Cantine del Notaio which was excellent! I'm a red wine lover and i never follow the rules when it comes to food pairings lol. Elis was kind enough to make sure that my wine glass was refilled when the wine was running low lol. I will certainly return soon, I am already craving the oysters, the food and the attention! Thank you, Artur and Elis for such a lovely night! It's no surprise they received the best restaurant award in the upper west side!  Cheers, Susan",0
"I visited Hometown Hotpot & BBQ yesterday for the millionth time and I'm surprised this is my first time leaving a Yelp review. My family and I love going to Hometown for our hotpot cravings because it's pretty solid. Food is good, service is good, it's AYCE, and the price is fair.

Yesterday, I ordered the Curry Soup Base and loved it. I usually get the Plain Chicken Broth but I was feeling a little adventurous. For our ingredients, we ordered Fish Fillet, Fried Fish Balls, Beef Tripe, Beef, Lamb, Instant Noodles, Tong Hao, Pumpkin, Taro, Quail Eggs, Bok Choy, Seaweed Knot, and a couple others I can't remember. Overall they were all delicious. No complaints. I do want to point out the Fish Fillet, Beef, and Instant Noodles were extra good yesterday. Maybe it was just my mood, but those were the three stars of yesterdays meal for me.

4/5 Yelp stars. We'll be back.",1
"I visited the restaurant after it reopened and was not impressed. The drinks were poor and the food was bland. I ordered the chicken quesadilla slice and it was so small I could have eaten the whole thing myself. The steak tacos were also bland and small. The atmosphere was hot and I could tell that the staff was on edge, but the food was not up to par.",1
I was really pleased with the food and service at this restaurant! The portions were really generous and the prices were much more reasonable than I expected. I would definitely recommend it for a nice soba lunch. They're now also on the online delivery platforms so you can enjoy your meal wherever you are!,1
I found Shanghai Mong to be quite disappointing. The food was bland and the prices were high for what you got. I would not recommend this restaurant.,1
"It serves its purpose. Nice views on the the top floor of a 33 story building on 40th St. They have multiple areas (I believe 3) each with sections and narrow dance floor space for parties. One of the areas is outdoors. The Saturday I came had a crowd of all different types of people. The DJ spun an interesting mix. A little something for everyone but won't focus on your vibe that you might want to hear. You got the fist pumping bro music and pop hits but also a nice mix of the hip hop and R&B I'm accustomed to.Appetizers were decent. I felt bottle service was good. We had a couple bottles of wine and some margaritas. Not sure the full price, I came here with a birthday party. The section wasn't huge but enough to accommodate about 8 people. I do believe they have varying sizes. My biggest complaint is that it was like the hottest day of the year in the middle of July and you could not feel Air Conditioning at all which we were told there would be. When we asked about it they said it was on but you couldn't feel it! It was sweltering! I wonder what that says about heat in the winter time??",0
"Yummy food, good, quick service, cute outdoor dining set up, good people watching. I'd definitely come back again.",0
"My friends and I stopped by here for dinner. The place itself was very cute and cozy but we did get a little confused on the seating arrangements as the front of the restaurant is a cafe with a different name. The restaurant seating was more in the back and they did have a good amount of seating. We were seated immediately and the menu definitely had a large amount of food. I did notice that this place was slightly more expensive than your typical Shanghai food restaurant in Chinatown so I was excited to taste the food. We decided to order: -Fried Wontons - this was just alright, pretty crispy but nothing special. -Marinated Jellyfish - I did not like this at all, the taste was a little weird but my friend who ordered it liked it so maybe it was just me -Traditional Shanghai Pan Fried Soup Dumplings: This was super yummy and I definitely recommend this. -Grandma's Pork Soup Dumplings: Pretty good for soup dumplings but I have definitely had better ones-Crab Roe Soup Dumplings: These were pretty good; I liked them more than the Grandma's Pork Soup Dumplings. -Dan Dan Noodes + Duck: The dan dan noodles were good the duck was way too salty so I would recommend just getting the Dan Dan Noodles Overall, everything was plated nicely and it was very aesthetically pleasing but taste wise I still prefer my traditional Shanghai restaurants in Chinatown. The price was little on the pricey side with it coming out to be around $25 per person (with tax and tip) and there were three of us.",0
"I had a good time at this restaurant. The food was generally pretty good, and the outdoor dining setup was really nice. I especially liked the way that the tables were divided, which made it easy to get between them. The only downside was that the service was a bit slow. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"The Ainsworth is a great place to go for drinks on a weekend. The outdoor setup is great and it's very cute. The service could have been a little more attentive, but since we just had drinks it wasn't too big of a deal. I'd definitely go back!",1
"I had a great time at the Expat! I loved their happy hour (4:30-6:30 daily), which is especially great because it's so affordable. I really appreciated the metal straws instead of nasty paper ones, and the kumquat spritz was amazing. The calamari appetizer was also pretty good - I liked that it was on skewers, but it was a tad doughy. The sauce was amazing, though. I also really liked the decor and menu - already excited to go back and try more items.",1
"I always enjoy stopping by this restaurant for a quick breakfast. It's conveniently located right above the W. 4th St. subway station, so it's easy to get to. The pastries are always fresh and delicious, and the prices are very reasonable. I especially love the steam egg creme bun! It's only less than two dollars, and it's a great way to start the day. I also recommend the tuna pastry and the egg tart.",1
"Came here for breakfast 2x. Ordered the ess-a-bagel with cream cheese on the side so I could enjoy it with the New Fashioned Deviled Crab (creamy ginger dressing, crunchy celery, ginger crumb). It was toasted to perfection. Also tried the Chia Seed Bowl (cacao, brazil nuts, dried fruits) which was creamy and just a touch of sweet. The Beauty Bowl (beet yogurt, honeycrisp apple, grapes, pistachio, bee pollen) is a stunning pink, and it's light and refreshing. The Farm Egg Omelet (ny state cheddar and radical farm greens) was a bit underwhelming, and I wish there would have been more cheese. I thought the Grilled Carrot Banh Mi (cilantro, pickled daikon, jalapeño) had wonderful flavor, but the carrot kept slipping out of the bun and it was impossible to eat like a banh mi. I had to use my knife and fork. Service was friendly but on the slower side. Ambiance is very nice. We sat on one side one morning and then the opposite the next. Their patio does not open until 11am these days, but they kindly let us take a browse!",0
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The space is beautiful, but the food was unfortunately not up to par. I had the steak and eggs and found it to be pretty bland and dry. The potatoes were also overcooked and quite greasy. My friend had the pasta dish and found it to be very good, but I wasn't blown away by it. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
Big Wong is a great restaurant with classic flavors. The roast bbq meats are delicious and juicy. I never had any dry bbq meat or any issue when I'm here. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
"I was really disappointed by my meal at this restaurant. The portions were very small, and the food did not have much flavor. My favorite part of the meal was the fries, which were really good. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Yummy yum yum...I had been resisting coming here for the longest time due to the location and in my mind being very touristy which to me usually means the food is usually meh. Was able to finagle a last minute reservation (this was before Omicron) at an early hour (5:45). Ordered lots of different items/with our eyes being bigger than our stomachs.We started with the crispy artichokes, then for entrees we had the RH burger (with avocado), the shaved ribeye, with sides of Truffled fries and broccolini. Almost everything was excellent, although the fries were the only item that I wish I hadn't ordered. Was too much food and they were average. I was pleasantly surprised on how good everything was, including the service.For dessert we had warmed chocolate chip cookies with sea salt on top. They were very large and took 11/2 of them home. Overall, I'd say it's a very nice restaurant, great ambiance, and will come back when the outside is open in the spring. Just wish they had a full liquor license but that seems to be a thing with them. I stopped by their location in Dallas and they also only offer beer and wine.",0
"Food is amazing! Very delicious.  Place has about 10 tables indoors with outside seating in good weather. Make reservations. The place was crowded on a weeknight. After 9pm is a better chance to get a table without reservations.  Can be an intimate romantic atmosphere or just a casual place with some friends.For the appetizers, we had Octopus salad, tuna tartare, cheese gnocchi. The grilled octopus was very flavorful. The tuna tartare came with guac, which was good. The cheese gnocchi was like mac and cheese, really good. For the entree, we had grilled branzino, mixed seafood grill and chopped salad. The chopped salad went well with the rest of the food, but I would probably get another tapa or side next time to go with the meal. This branzino was very tasty. Can't go wrong with that one. My favorite is the seafood mix grill. It's a taste of a few things: grilled shrimp, scallop, salmon kabob, tuna slider. All really good and juicy, especially the shrimp and scallop. So flavorful.We had the bread pudding and sorbet. The bread pudding is not to be missed. It was so yummy, creamy and fluffy.The wine we had we good and smooth also and went well with the meal.Highly recommended!",0
"I'm not sure what it is about this place, but I just couldn't get into it. The exterior of the restaurant is from the show Seinfeld, and I'm sure that's a big draw for some people, but I wasn't impressed. The interior was kind of a dump, and the food was overpriced and mediocre. I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"I had a great time at COVID! They were so welcoming and generous with their food and donations. They sent lots of delicious options that everyone could enjoy, and the delivery was really fast and easy. I really appreciate their work to support healthcare workers in our community. I can't wait to go try their restaurant in person!",1
"I thought the food at this restaurant was okay. The service was good, and the friends I went with really liked the Seafood Pancake. However, I didn't think the ramen was very good - it was too soft and didn't come out crispy enough. The Bossam meat was also alright, but I didn't like that the cabbage was blanched in salt water (or maybe it was seasoned? not sure but it was way too salty). Overall, I wouldn't come back, but my friends might.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The 'Flank & Brisket Pho' was delicious and the people there are so nice. It's located conveniently outside the Christopher St 1 station. I'll definitely be back!,1
"DEFINITELY ASTORIA LOCATION IS BETTER!!!!It is very dangerous when you are expanding your business and opening extra branches. When you know the original store and the portion sizes, you will always compare the new ones to original one! And you cannot serve anything less what you were serving before, then you get a bad credit!! Whoever reads this they will understand it, if you tried the original one!Definitely a clean restaurant, you can judge it how the restrooms are clean. But be careful, the floor tiles are not chosen carefully, they are slippery when wet!Grilled octopus is a superb, cannot go wrong with that.Cold appetizer plate is ok, could be better. Could have gotten something else instead. I love tarama salata, but the way they prepared is not right. The way you make is whip the red caviars with oil, then add the lemon to whiten it. If it is still salty, add a touch of water.Salad could be better, don't like the steak tomatoes, would be better with plum or roma tomatoes.Saganaki came without the flame!!Love the fried whiting, but with the portion size of the lemon potatoes, i got robbed.Overall ok, won't be back to this location, going back to Astoria.",0
Good Ramen and decent portion sizes at a reasonable price so not much to complain about here. Dining in service is a little bit odd because it does seem to be more of a take-out spot but I don't know if that's just because of Covid right now. For those looking for a Ramen spot that also has a ton of other foods this menu is relatively limited and they do have poke bowls but not a ton of other options.,0
"I would give this restaurant a 4 but I'm giving it 1 less star for making us wait 40 minutes even though we had a reservation. It's pretty ironic that they can cancel the reservation on you if you're 15 minutes late, but they can make you wait for 40 minutes without any explanation. In order to make up for the wait, they gave us 2 apps on the house, which was appreciated and very good. The first was green chickpea hummus which was one of the best dishes we had that day.  It had plenty of flavor and was very creamy. Additionally, they gave us avocado toast which was also very good. You needed to squeeze a bit of lime on top because without it, it was pretty bland. I got the mushroom and egg dish (substituted poached eggs with scrambled eggs) and really enjoyed it. Everything was very flavorful and the eggs were perfectly cooked. We also shared the fingerling potatoes which I would recommend. I did taste the coconut sticky rice dish and lentil dish and didn't really enjoy either of those, but my table liked them. I wouldn't rush to come back especially if the restaurant would make me wait again for 40 minutes even when having a reservation.",0
"I had a normal meal at this restaurant, nothing particularly special but still good. The table was close to other the neighbors and there were a queue like 7 pm.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The pizza was good, but the deep dish square pizza was really oily. The salad was also inedible, and very spicy. The ceasar salad was also quite poor - there was an entire anchovy in it, which was quite gross. The service was also terrible - the waitress didn't seem to understand what I was saying, and when I asked her if the anchovy in the ceasar salad was in the dressing, she said no, it was in the salad itself. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning.",1
"I was really impressed with Focaccia and Olive Oil! It looks like a very humble restaurant, but the food tastes like a homemade dream. The focaccia is sturdy, but melts in your mouth, and the olive oil is a perfect addition. The chicken parmigiana was good, but the risotto with peas was outstanding. Bread bread is also a great option, and I will definitely come back here. It was very tasty and I like the small rustic feel of the restaurant.",1
Hey Yuet is a great option for traditional dim sum in Chelsea. The food is delicious and the service is great. I highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for delicious dim sum.,1
"The pizza at this restaurant is really good! The portions are huge, and the pizza tastes great even though the online ordering is clunky. The service is not so great, though. I made an online pickup order through Yelp, and it took a while for the restaurant to confirm my order. Since I live pretty close to the restaurant, I decided to just take my chances and show up to the restaurant and wait for my order. The man at the cash register looked unhappy and looked irritated when I told him I was there to pick up my order. Despite the lackluster service and ordering process, the pizza was really good. I would definitely come back to this restaurant. However, I would skip the garlic knots, as they are inexpensive but there wasn't anything noteworthy about them.",1
"Picked up some takeout the other day and was pleasantly surprised.  The reviews are all of the place for this location, but it's so convenient being located right on 84th and Broadway, it's right in between my sons apt and my hotel. Tuna Poke nachos came packed with lots of fresh Tuna, tomatoes, avocado, Hints of fresh lime, ginger and soy sauce it comes in a separate container so the fresh chips don't get soggy.  This dish was surprisingly good.Roasted Brussel Sprouts take the prize! These were to die for!  Sautéed in a Thai vinaigrette, with peanuts and sprinkled with red chili flakes.  These are totally worth a try.Everything was packed nicely including silverware and napkins.   The menus pretty extensive for s burger place. A nice choice of good salads, and creative burgers.  I heard the impossible burger is amazing.  I'll be back and the have nice outdoor seating with heaters.",0
"Came here on a weekday for lunch, they do not offer lunch special anymore, which is fine. But I tried the ginger stamina ramen, it was ok. There's a lot of flavor because it added ground Pork chives and all other spices. But the broth itself is very water down, they have all these flower to cover the weak broth. Also it's weird that they are charging $1.5 just for the chili paste but they asking you to choose the spicy level, so basically none of them is spicy unless you want to add $1.5 extra. The only good thing needs to mention is the pork belly on top, really thick piece and good torched flavor. Also hate that they have so rules about spicy oil or paste not allowed on the side and can't remove the ground pork those are just customized I don't know why they are not allowed to make it so complicated.",0
"The Bread Factory Cafe is a great place to go for a quick meal. The bread itself is always fresh and has a great taste. The service is always quick and the food is cheap. However, I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for something fancy.",1
"While the hostess was super friendly and offered more service than any other waitstaff, this restaurant was a total fail. Made a reservation for 10 which was honored on Christmas Day. Had tickets to a 12 noon show of the Big Apple Circus. It seems this diner has a system for the staff. You order with the waiter. The runners bring you the food.  If you need water you have to get it from the waiter. Even the busboy wouldn't pour water. When we sat down we ordered coffee, juice and egg creams along with the food. The drinks never came. I watched as our awful waiter (very friendly) took orders from all his tables. We asked several people as they passed if we could get our drinks. All said we had to ask the waiter. We got our food and drinks at 11. The pancakes, omelettes and bagel were good. We had to repeatedly ask for jelly, mustard and more coffee and water. I would never return.",0
"MCame here on a weekday night for dinner. The initial wait did take a little bit of time, they won't seat you until everyone has arrived so be prepared for a little bit of wait. After waiting for about 20-30 minutes, we were seated at the bar. The waiter was super friendly and very quick to provide us with an overview of the menu. You can choose a couple set of handrolls - I got the 6-roll set and a sake. The sake came in a cute little glass and it was a perfect amount. The 6-roll was great, it was super filling. My favorites were the scallop and the salmon.Great value, super good quality and price. If you want a good affordable sushi place, this is the spot!",0
"I was really excited to try this restaurant based on all of the good reviews, but unfortunately my experience was not as great as I had hoped. The rib ramen was my favorite dish, but it was really bland and the noodles were not very fresh. The tonkatsu ramen was also disappointing - the pork was dry and the sauce was bland. The dumplings were good, but the portion was quite large. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",1
"I thought that the restaurant got four stars because they are gluten free. But I found that the sweets were too sweet. The pecan bars and cookies were overly sweet, and the chocolate chip cookies were also too sweet. I love a good pecan bar, but I couldn't taste the pecans in the bar because it was so sweet. The cookies were also too sweet, and I didn't really taste the chocolate chips. However, all in all, the restaurant was the first dessert that I had, and I am grateful for that. I just wish that there was a bread option that wasn't sweet.",1
"This is the second time I have been here and I have liked both my life experiences so far. We usually come here for their skewers primarily. This time we ordered chicken gizzards, lamb testicles, lamb kidneys, squid, duck tongue.. and I liked the lamb testicles the best and chicken gizzards the least best but nevertheless will order again if I'm not feeling up to try something new.. duck tongue was second best for me..",0
"Came back on Christmas Day for a quick lunch. Got what is basically Kung Pao chicken, but they call it chicken with peanuts on the lunch menu. I ordered it very spicy but as expected it wasn't really. The flavor was good in this dish though overall and I would get it again.",0
"Hmmm where do I begin. Don't think my review for this spot will be so different from previous reviews but I can attest that the service is kinda meh, but for an all you can eat deal at $35 in Manhattan you're crazy to expect much else!The hot pot materials were of acceptable quality but it really put me off that when we picked fish balls or anything for a party of 4 people they literally would bring 4 fish balls at a time. As an ice cream lover, I did love the free reign on what must have been dozens of flavor free for me to self scoop with side of poki sticks. Personal fan of their matcha and grape seed flavors and think this is a rather generous perk.Things to note:* there's a 1 hour and 40 min limit to the ""unlimited buffet""* if you come on a Saturday night it's relatively empty around 6/6:30 but expect to wait long lines to be seated post 7pm. Best to make reservations* soft drinks are part of unlimited deal but beer ran ~$3 a bottle so still a steal",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch and I was impressed with the wings. They were crispy and well-seasoned. The only downside was that the sauce was a bit sparse. However, the wings were definitely worth a try.",1
"A bit of disappointment from the food. Didn't have any expectations and came out being more disappointed. Services were great but the food was lacking. We got the combo, jiajiang noodle and the sesame noodle and almost everything came out overly salty. The appetizer, pickle, looked nice but tasted like eating salt. Once I put into my mouth, I had to stop and went to grab some rice. The noodle, both jiajiang and sesame, caught me off guard. Noodle stick together, the sauce didn't mix well into the noodle and still tasted salty. The only thing I like was their Lou ro rice. Nice egg presentation and the tiny strip size pork belly was very tasty with the rice.",0
"I was really disappointed with the food at this restaurant. The wings were greasy and bland, and the tofu was overcooked and bland. The short ribs were also undersalted and had a tough texture. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at Saigon Shack! The pho broth was amazing and had a great body to it. The spring rolls were also a favorite of mine - they were so unique and delicious. I also really enjoyed the fish tacos - they were so warm, fresh and had great flavors. The waitresses were also very kind and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Vietnamese meal!",1
We came here on a Friday night and surprisingly we got seated right away. Our server was both attentive and friendly which we appreciated very much! We enjoyed the 5 napkin burger as well as the kale salad.,0
"Why I rated four stars. After searching for Spanish food this restaurant came across because my experience with other Spanish restaurants has not been great. I decided to order from Doordash (I'm not promoting Doordash)I ordered an Oven Chicken combo it comes with rice, beans, sweet plantain, soda, and a small green salad and the other Combo was the same thing but with an Onion Steak and a side order of tostones. I wrote a note in the app instead of the soda if they can send me water and they did ""Thank you"". The chicken has the same taste as other chicken you buy at any Spanish restaurant lol, the beans were good, the rice needs a little bit more salt and pours some oil like the way we cook rice at home and I think in my personal opinion is (I am looking for a unique flavor of Spanish food) and no restaurant have delivered that yet! Four days ago I ordered again through their website but this time I order 2 whole chickens, 2 orders of tostones, and Churrasco with tostones but they forgot the ""churrasco sauce/onions and the tostones were semi-raw"" not cool. Overall, I think the food is decent, not too expensive.",0
"My college friend decided to try this spot. This casual hangout spot is know for their Cal Tex-Mex street food.  The tacos were definitely deceivingly filling but I ended up ordering the appetizers as the main entree. The food I ordered was pretty good with leftovers to take home.I ordered the sangria, which was really good with the tot-chos with the chili and grilled Mexican corn. I also requested to take the corn out of the cob. Food, drinks and service were solid. I would recommend this spot.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The portions are really generous and the food is really great. I would definitely recommend ordering accordingly, especially if you're looking to try their meringue dessert. The blue shrimp aguachile was a great start to the meal and the duck enmoladas were really delicious. The mole negro was also a great addition to the meal. Overall, I had a really great time and I would definitely come back.",1
"Got a campero and an arroz negro. The board was ok, nothing special. Arroz negro was much too salty. Would not come here again for the price.",0
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The food wasn't particularly good, and the prices are definitely on the lower end. I would recommend sticking to a few dishes, especially if you're looking for something more affordable. The pork chop was decent, but I would recommend trying something else if you're looking for a more affordable option.",1
"Still probably my fave spot in town! Came here for restaurant week brunch with 2 friends - we had a reservation and were seated more or less immediately upon arrival. Love that during the summer months brunch is on the roof, with both indoor and outdoor seating available! We decided to sit indoors since it was a bit hot, but it's nice to have the option.Restaurant week brunch is also a great deal for $26! I got the hellfire roll, salmon a la plancha with kale pesto, and the vanilla Oreo banana pudding. All of the food was delicious - the tuna on the hellfire roll tasted very fresh, and my salmon was perfectly cooked. I also need to figure out a way to get my hands on that kale pesto recipe - definitely one of my favorite sauces! The vanilla Oreo banana pudding is a restaurant week brunch dessert special - it was a larger portion than I was expecting served in a mason jar, more pudding like than Oreo like, with a lot of berry and fruity tones to it! I was a fan, although it was slightly different than what I was expecting! Highly recommend Catch no matter the meal or time of year, but there's no doubt that restaurant week is a prime time to make a visit and try out some new dishes, too!",0
"Oh Spot! I've heard about this spot (harhar) for so many years, but was finally able to visit for the first time last night. It's a super popular dessert place in the city, and despite coming on a random Monday night, we still had to add our party of 2 on the waitlist for 20-30 min before getting seated. They have a variety of desserts, teas, and drinks to choose from.  I opted for the golden toast which was delicious! Not mind blowing good, but a solid go to spot for dessert. I think next time I'll try the eye catching potted plant cheesecake (the Harvest!)Pricing as of Jan 2022 is around $12-13 per dessert.",0
"Ordered for delivery the other day and was happy with my order. I ended up getting a hot and sour soup and the Lo Mein with pork. They have quite a few lunch specials available but I opted to go with another dish. Prices are good - not the cheapest Chinese delivery option but totally affordable for an everyday dinner. I believe my soup was $3.50 and the lo mein was $11 or so.Food was good. The soup wasn't the best I've had but was totally decent and chock full of veggies. It wasn't super gelatinous as hot and sour soup can sometimes be. The lo mein was great. Flavorful without being too oily and a generous portion size. Noodles were a good texture.All in all, a totally viable competitor to other Chinese options in the neighborhood. Will order again.",0
"I came across Cathedrale on Open Table. I was drawn to it by the spectacular interior decor and its interesting yet reasonably priced brunch menu (nope, no Eggs Benedict here). Both the interior dining room and the ""outdoor space"" (it had sunlight coming through but was fully covered by glass windows) were as attractive as I saw in the photos. That automatically elevated our experience to fine dining status even before we sat down. The quality of food here matched that of its decor. We started with an olive oil muffin served with marmalade. It had hints of olive oil and was just moist enough. For entrees, we ordered the Potato Chip Omelette, Slow Cooked Salmon, and Pain Perdu ""Suzette"". The omelette sure felt like a splurge that we needed. It was topped with Kaluga caviar and creme fraiche. The potato chips provided the needed crunchiness to contrast the other smooth ingredients. I almost never order omelettes for brunch; I sure was glad that I changed my mind this time. Our boys had so much fun tasting caviar for the first time as they popped each ""bubble"" between their teeth. The slow cooked salmon was also very satisfying as it was crispy on the edges yet still moist on the inside. The quinoa provided some of the acidity to the dish, making it a perfect sidekick. If you prefer sweet brunch items like I do sometimes, you can't go wrong with the pain perdu. The overall quality of food and attractiveness of the space easily make Cathedrale one of my favorite dining experiences in the city since the pandemic. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the staff could be a bit more attentive. I am not sure if they were short-staffed that day, but service sure felt slower than we would've liked. Also, they forgot my order of cold brew coffee, which worked out okay since I was able to get my caffeine for the day a couple blocks away later at a much anticipated new cafe.",0
"I've eaten here plenty of times. The food is mediocre, the frozen drinks are laced with syrup and sugar; yet, this place is always busy. Each time I come here, the same people are always here... and they all the know each other. This place attracts old and young, hipsters, college students, artists, etc. The draw to this place is the diverse customers. Come often enough and you'll find yourself with a new circle of friends. If Cheers or Central Perk was  a real place and located in Harlem, it would be this place.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant with a Pulsd deal and was not disappointed. The service was fast and the atmosphere was comfortable. The only downside was the price - it was a bit expensive compared to nearby Sichuan restaurants. The famous dishes, such as the lamb with cumin, were good, but the fish fillet in chili sauce was especially spicy. The noodles in the Tan Tan Noodle were unfortunately overcooked and broken, which detracted from the dish.",1
"This is definitely the kind of place you come to when you want to celebrate (unless you have that kind of money)! I came here to celebrate my 26th birthday, last month and was happy with how amazing the experience at Candle 79 was. I tried a lot of items which is suggested, since if you're like me you won't be back here for a while. The menu hosts vegan takes of dishes from all over the world so there truly is something for everyone. The staff were very attentive and the dishes were brought out in a timely fashion.",0
"The line was long so I figured that was a positive sign and therefore was super excited!However, I wasn't wowed.  We ordered a little bit of everything to try.The presentation looked great and promising.Some was good but nothing mind-blowing.  Also, the food was cold.  The service was meh.  Don't know what all the fuss is about.  Won't be going again.",0
"We've been coming here for years, And we always come back to the house special the platters of warm fresh pastas with salad or anti-pasta.  This time we were a little disappointed, we got there early and four of us were placed at a very tight table in front of the kitchen door. Previously the selections of pasta included a vegetable topped, cheese filled, & fish Pasta.  Tonight's choices were not as special.  We enjoyed the spaghetti and tomato sauce, spinach ravioli and pasta Bolognese.  We were not wowed with the choices, they were just OK.  We missed the pesto sauce, the linguini and clam's...",0
"I came here for lunch on a Tuesday with a friend since I work nearby.  The place was relatively new and I was glad since I've been looking for a good Mexican place in the area.  They have a good lunch special that includes a drink for $10.  I ordered a carnitas quesadilla.  It came with so many sauces: 2 kinds of salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.  The food was fresh and hot even though I took it to go.  There was a lot of pork in the quesadilla and the muenster cheese was different.  The portion was larger than I expected.  I would come back and try other items.  I saw a lot of people ordering the burrito and tacos.  They also offer whole wheat tortilla which I would like to try as well.  I'll be back!",0
"COVID-19 update: delivery and take out offered; limited outdoor seating (reservations recommended)Food & drinks: awesome! From the spicy mezcal margaritas to dip appetizers to an amazing Caesar salad everything was high quality and quite flavorfulService: a little bit slow, but very friendly. The restaurant was pretty busy.Tables: tables could have been a bit further apart from one another, though they have a great new ""street patio"" which is worth checking out!",0
"I love coming to Harry's for the square pies. Not many places make it better in the city. This time I visited during a Sunday Brunch and was pleasently surprised by the options. Service was also specially attentive in the morning. The brunch may not be worth it unless you plan to drink a lot of Mimosas or Bloody Mary's. The food was all well seasoned and prepared to order. Would definitly come again, but maybe skip the Brunch and order regularly.",0
"I'm regular here--duke at the moment. It's a very solid Thai restaurant in the Upper West Side and Manhattan in general. In fact, it's our favorite Thai restaurant in Manhattan. I like it more than Thai Villa (same owner).The decors are amazing, maybe a bit too much for a real comfort food. The place is good for socializing with friends, but not too much for romantic or business dining, as the sound can get extremely loud. Not to mention, there isn't much room. It definitely appears as if they cramped more tables/seats than the norm. There were instances when customers leaving their tables unfortunately got their coats into others' dishes. Food is good. I recommend Pad Thai Bolan (not to be confused with the regular Pad Thai here, which definitely isn't as good) and Krapow Gai Sup (Basil Chicken). The Hoy Dub (Sword clam) used to be good, but since it's grand opening, the amount of clams you get has lowered dramatically--hence, I no longer order such. Crab meat Thai omelet tastes good, but largely because of the omelet, it is overly priced for a 1-2 pieces of crab meat thrown on top of what would otherwise be a regular Thai omelet dish.",0
"Came here on a weekday evening, called first to see whether I'd have to wait and was told no wait but first come first serve. That was fine, showed up, seated immediately outside. Place didn't have too many people, had heaters above the tables. QR code menu, ordered the khao soi and wanted flat rice noodles but was told the chef ""didn't want to do it"". Um...okay? Got it spicy with tofu, came out a few minutes later, was delicious. Lacking soup a bit, deep curry flavor, a lot of fried tofu although a bit dry (needs more sauce!), very flavorful overall. I love khao soi and this is definitely one of the better ones I've had in the US. Alright on the pricing as it came out to be around $15 post-tax pre-tip.",0
"Returned for lunch and had an even better experience this time around. No wait on Friday afternoon. Curry puffs, Beef buns, Chicken pad Thai and Thai iced tea were all excellent. Highlight was the beef buns. Service was quick. Definitely one of the best Thai options in the area!",0
"Came here on a thursday night. There was a line outside already but since we were a party of two, we got inside 2 minutes after lining up.  They scan IDs as soon as you walk in. We were then led to our table.They have an assortment of cheap cocktails and shots. Food is pretty cheap as well. Ordered some shots and cocktails. The drinks came out super quickly and were decently strong. Also ordered lemon chicken, fries, karaage, and calamari.Service is spotty. Have to flag down waiters. One of the waiters placed our order on the wrong table (next to us) and after about 5 minutes, just moved it back to our table. I had no problem w it cause i saw that the other table did not touch it but the waiter did not seem to care about that... Food came out about 20 minutes later. Waiter forgot my salad and rice that came w the lemon chicken and had to ask another waiter for it.Lemon chicken was very sour- the sauce seemed to be just butter + lemon juice but it tasted alright with the rice! Calamari was a little soft, not crispy enough. Fries and karaage were very good!Would come again for cheap drinks and bar food",0
"I stopped by this restaurant on a Thursday afternoon and found it to be relatively empty. The server was very friendly and we ordered the pork jowl buns which were absolutely delicious. The meat itself was super tender and the bun itself was soft and the flavors went so well together. I was however disappointed by the ramen. The Tonkotsu Ramen was definitely flavorful but way too strong - instead of tasting fully the flavor it just tasted extremely salty. The noodles itself was good but the strong flavor of the soup was just too much for me. The Yaki Ramen itself had the same problem - it was way too flavorful that it was borderline too salty for my liking. Overall, the noodle texture itself was great but the flavors were just too strong for it to be enjoyable for me and my mom. I am not sure about the other ramen dishes but basing it off those two dishes I don't see myself coming back in the future as there are other ramen places that I would definitely rather to go in the future.",1
"I been to this location several times. I tried the heritage sausage, veggie, and the pepperoni. It always comes with the sauce. I really like the concept. The sauce is good but the square slices are too hard. The pizza also never comes out hot. I like this place and it's by my home. Hopefully they improve.",0
"Wah Fung serves up an array of savory roasted meats over rice at wallet-friendly prices on the Lower East Side.this is a gritty fast-paced Chinese barbecue meats joint. there is no seating. Wah Fung is strictly a grab-n-go restaurant. the space is very small and worn-in. it has that old school New York feel. basically you get on line as there is always a small line that juts out the door bc the place is tiny. the line moves fast. the food? a delicious selection of Chinese comfort food. there are several choices of meat: roasted duck, roast pig (pork belly), barbecue pork (char sui), and roast chicken. the sizes are small ($4-$5ish) and large ($6-8). you can get one kind of meat, two meats, or three meats-- over rice and cabbage. the char siu (bbq Pork) + pork belly (roasted pig) are my go-to combo. yes, i am ODing on swine, but both are that good. the char sui is savory sweet and loaded with flavor. the pork belly is crispy fatty and meaty. the rice and cabbage soaks up the layers of flavor from the proteins and it makes for a satisfying meal. the small is ample if you're hangry or can be shared by two if you're looking for just a bite. the large is HUUUUGE. prices are low. the food is filling. tip: duck runs out, so go earlier in the day.there are so many public seating options in the area like the parks and gardens that you can grab food and eat ""al fresco"" aka outside. the staff is fast and efficient. they keep the line moving. make up your mind before you order as they don't have time for your q's or shenanigans. loldrops mic cuz i'm WAH FUNGING tonighti outzzz",0
"Overall, the food was ok, but the service was rushed and not very friendly. The brunch atmosphere was nice and comfortable, but the food presentation was terrible - I didn't feel like I could really enjoy my meal. The mimosas were a good value, though.",1
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the new Pan-Asian spot from the Chinese Tuxedo team and it was amazing! The menu has a variety of influences, and everything we tried was delicious. The Singaporean Chili Crab Fried Rice ($25) and the Stir Fried Rice Noodles with Crispy Tofu ($16) were standouts. The atmosphere is great, even with only outdoor dining available right now. The large booths provide some of the nicest seating currently possible. I can't wait to go back and try the Nasi Goreng Crispy Squid Ink Fried Rice ($22)!",1
"Havana Central was a great choice for Cuban food. Our server was informative and friendly, and we were able to order food that was vegan-friendly. The Vegetable Paella was a great choice, and the Salmon was also very good. The rice and beans were a little bland, but the mix of vegetables helped make up for it. The Tostones were a bit disappointing, though, and need salt to be really good. The Rose Sangria was delicious and very fruity. Overall, a great Cuban experience.",1
"I was really happy to find Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli, as I'm always on the lookout for a vegan banh mi. They have 4 types of vegan banh mis on their menu, and I tried the #10. The banh mis was delicious, with plenty of radish filling. I wished there was more tofu and mushroom in the filling, but overall it was a very satisfying sandwich. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, and the portion size was large to me. The only downside was that the store itself is just take out only, and there is no seating inside. However, the menu has some other appetizers like summer rolls and Vietnamese beverages, so I'll definitely be back for my banh mi fix!",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The window table was amazing and the service was great. I can't wait to come back and eat outside in the warmer months. The only downside was that the food was a bit expensive, but overall I really enjoyed my experience.",1
"I was underwhelmed by Kuu in the UES. The atmosphere was more of a lunch or takeout place, and the food didn't quite live up to my expectations. My boyfriend got the chili ramen and I got the miso pork ramen. The miso pork ramen came with two slices of pork belly with a soy sauce egg and veggies on the side. The pork belly was okay- had a pretty chart on the outside but that was pretty much it. The egg was cold which I was not really happy with. I also wasn't a huge fan of the arugula as a side garnish- it was an unexpected acidity and bitterness that didn't really add to the dish in any way. Overall, average ramen place.",1
"On first glance, this pizza had a lot of the qualities you look for. Good crisp. Good cheese. Hot. Fresh.But the oregano ruined it for me. It was very noticeable. I can't remember having pizza where an herb like that was so noticeable. I thought it was overpowering enough where I regretted eating there. There was also a noticeable and off-putting amount of saltiness too.",0
"I had a really enjoyable time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was really authentic and the food was delicious. It was pretty busy when we were there, but that only made the experience that much better. They have a good selection of food on their menu, from pastas to pizzas to fish. My favorite dish was the Parma pizza, which had a generous amount of prosciutto and arugula. The lasagna, veal pappardelle and spaghetti alle vongole were also all very tasty and flavorful. The only downside was that the portions were a bit smaller than I was expecting, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
Came here for drinks and the food looked so appetizing I have to figure out a way to come back. Drinks and service good. Tons of seating. Open late.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great and the food was even better. I ordered the eggs Benedict, and it was delicious. The egg was perfectly cooked and the yolk spilled out when I cut it with a fork. The side salad was also a great addition to the meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great brunch experience.",1
"3.5 starsI love a good chicken sammish. With CFA a train ride away, I wanted somewhere I could walk to. I found this place which had a good 4.5 star rating.I ordered their spicy buffalo sandwich with a side of fries per the suggestion of the cashier. I thought the sando was okay. I knew from the beginning that the buffalo sauce would overpower the sandwich and I was right. The sandwich became really soggy from the sauce and I had to eat it with a fork and knife, which I hate. I really enjoyed the fries though. I had to stop myself from finishing the generous portion of fries. Their table side hot sauce was decent but not spicy at all. My friend ordered the salad with fried chicken and enjoyed it.The area is a little sketch around this restaurant. No lie, I saw a women pop a squat and take a leak across the street. We were sitting at the bar seats facing the street so we had a front row view too. The service was amazing, however I don't think this is my favorite fried chicken joint in the city.",0
"I was really disappointed by the new outdoor dining section at this restaurant. There are not a single wheelchair accessible table, which is incredibly disrespectful. Beyond that, the atmosphere was really unpleasant - it felt like the staff was just trying to be rude to us all the time. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"To celebrate our Valentine's Day early, my fiancé surprised me with Spoon and Table bar for dinner! As it was the evening of February 13, the restaurant was crowded with numerous couples and friends! Our server didn't even talk to us until about 25 minutes after sitting down. Nonetheless, the restaurant was busy and the staff members almost looked overworked. We ended up ordering the red snapper with sweet potato mash as well as the mussels! We didn't get our food until about half an hour after ordering. However, everything was worth the wait! The red snapper was very soft, although it was a tad too salty. Nevertheless, this minor issue was resolved by using the sweet potato to neutralize the saltiness! This complimentary pair was just large enough to feel like I was full, but not too large that I would feel the itis afterward. The mussels were also delicious as well! They were bathed in a mix of white wine and buttery sauce. However, it was a shame that some of the mussels were missing the meat and were only empty shells. Furthermore, when chewing on some of them, we bit into lots of sand. Although a fantastic indicator of the mussels being fresh, it would have been nice to eat some mussels without being interrupted by some pesky sand particles. The mussels were also paired with some crispy and flavorful fries and some garlic bread, which was hard, but eventually softened up when dipped in any sauce. Overall a lovely experience to have! I have heard of people coming here for brunch, so I would love to come back here and try their delicious brunch food. Judging from their dinner, I have high expectations of their brunch being delicious for when I come back again! Definitely a great place to come to if you are in the area!",0
"I had a great time at Nocello! The food was delicious and authentic, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I especially recommend the burrata as an appetizer and anything pasta. The gnocchi with pesto is more of a creamy pesto texture than an oily one, which I enjoyed. Their pistachio dessert is also incredible - it's a layered pistachio cake, an Italian recipe which I've rarely found in US restaurants. Comes with delicious ice cream (caramel type). Perfect for sharing.

The wine is good quality, mostly imported from Italy. Owners and waiters are Italian. I hope to be back soon to try more of their dishes!",1
"The restaurant is small and cozy, with a lot of character. The service was friendly and prompt, and the food was good value for money. The sushi roll (spicy Maki Combo) was a bit ordinary, but the bento box featuring California rolls that disintegrated easily was satisfactory. I liked the salmon teriyaki and the shumai. The beef Udon has some nice beef slices, and makes for a filling dish.",1
"The food was great! The California burrito had french fries inside it which made it a lot more delicious. The fish taco was also really good, the breading was light and airy. The only downside was that the quesadilla wasn't very good.",1
"I was really excited to go to this restaurant, but unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. The line was incredibly long and there was only one person working the front counter. Additionally, there was only one person in the kitchen, which made it difficult to get our food. The only thing that was hot were the fries, which were unfortunately not very good. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was ready to pick up in just 15 minutes and it was all delicious. We got the chicken and mushroom, hot and sour, and beef. All of it was really good and we would definitely recommend it to others. We also got the pig ear, but honestly it was pretty bland. I could barely taste the spice so I would skip that if I were you. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and I'm definitely coming back!",1
"I was too busy on a work call to realize my coworker took me into the wrong restaurant but maybe it's the same owner ! I wanted to go to Tavola  ( next door). Nonetheless, the food was good but that mixed with the environment, it just wasn't the vibe that I wanted or like! Best part was the modern top 40 music!",0
"My second time to Shukette, and things are looking up.  Pleasant welcome at the door; no fuss seating options right outside (chic and comfy yellow chairs, in sets of two).  I had a Spring spritz while waiting for my friends, and def reco.  Proper dining table still boldly uncomfortable (ikea garden furniture isn't really intended for fine dining), but food was delicious and service on point.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The drinks were really strong and the staff was really friendly. I loved my Flying Cock, which is a block away from here, but the staff can be a bit transactional. Here, everyone is just so friendly. It is like going over someone's home and just hanging out, but obviously there is a bill to pay at the end of the moment. Two thumbs up for this place and one of few, if not the only, places I would freeze my butt off dining and drinking outside.",1
"I was very disappointed with my visit to this restaurant. The food was bland and not very satisfying. I ordered tacos for takeout and was not very happy with the results. The tacos came with cotija cheese, slices of lime and radish, but the meat was flavorless and there were no other veggies to add flavor. The elote was also good but not the best I've had. The guacamole was decent but not amazing. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Perfect end to a beautiful day back in October 2021. We saw a show and opted to take the walk to Patsy's and I'm so glad we did! Everything was delicious from the salads to appetizer to entrees. Service was impeccable! They asked for vaccination cards and we showed them our app. We felt safe and appreciated dining here.Next Broadway show, we will return!",0
"We came here for RW lunch, but Nougatine also offers a weekday 3 course prix fixe lunch on the regular.  Wanting to cover all our bases, we ordered one of each.Surprisingly, we enjoyed the RW lunch more, highlighting the fact that more expensive doesn't always mean better.Restaurant week Lunch prix fixe $26- Chilled cucumber yogurt soup with grilled shrimp:  Lovely presentation.  The soup was refreshing on a hot summer day.  The shrimp still had the poop tract intact.  Gross.  A blunder for a higher end restaurant, I'd think.- Corn nut crusted flounder: Well done!  The fish was cooked perfectly, and that corn nut crust was so crispy.  Very nice texture contrast.  Loved the corn emulsion too.Lunch prix fixe $44- Tuna tartare: Beautiful presentation and equally delicious.- Black Sea bass: The skin on the sea bass was soggy.  Maybe it had been sitting too long before it arrived at our table?  The best item on the dish was the side of uber creamy potato puree and basil vinagrette.  I could have just eaten that and done without the fish.- Apricot tart with marzipan ice cream:  Meh.  Again, the main star of the dish was ok but pales in comparison to it's sidekick: the ice cream.  If you like the taste of marzipan, this is not to be missed.Service was impeccable. 5/5So all in all, some hits and some misses.  I'd go back for RW, but I don't think I'd make it a mandatory stop on my next visit otherwise.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was really pretty and had a unique entrance. The service was good. We ordered a bunch of things so we could all share family style, but all the food came out at different times and I don't mean a bit off - I mean first and last items were about an hour off. The place had the heat so low we had to wear our coats inside. 

With special requests they were good and accommodating when we asked for meat to be on the side for most dishes, but food for cold quick, came out delayed and ruined the mood. The tomato soup with grilled cheese was 8/10, pancakes were 9/10, mac and cheese 6/10, and pizza 4/10.",1
"Zia Maria's is a nice spot for a classic and unpretentious Italian meal in Chelsea. We stopped in on a quiet Sunday afternoon, and were seated in their spacious and comfortable dining room. After a couple of glasses of wine, we enjoyed a salad, a pizza Bianca with perfect crust for her, and plate of classic spaghetti pomodoro for me. Zia Maria's is a good choice for unassuming Italian with a family atmosphere in the neighborhood.",0
"This place is simply fine - they were quite crowded on a Thursday night, so they found a folding table behind the bar and set it up outside for us. We got a couple of ""spicy"" margs that turned out to not even be spicy for me, a notorious baby when it comes to spice. They were flavorful though & masked the alcohol until I left feeling solidly drunk after a couple. It is a bit pricey at $16/drink, which is why I probably would not come back as the drinks weren't so outstanding.",0
"Came here with a group of 4 on a Saturday evening around 7pm. The wait was about 30 minutes. There is only 1 table for a group of 4, meanwhile about 5 other tables for 2. They also had a long bar area to sit at. In all, I would say the venue is pretty small, seating only about 20 people at most. For food, I got the tontoro ramen, which is similar to the torigara just with the pork broth instead of chicken broth. Compared to the torigara, the tontoro is heavier with the chewy noodles. However, I wouldn't say it was too heavy that you feel awful after eating. The chasu pork was okay, but not extremely tender. Portion-wise, it isn't a lot, but enough given the density. They have some unique options - I tried the yuzu dashi that came with with thin straight noodles and it was very light. It had a very light yuzu taste in the broth. A good option if you want a light meal, but not as satisfying if you're looking for a hearty meal. Overall, good meal, but wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",0
"Dallas BBQ is an infallibly good time. It has been this way for as long as I've been going to restaurants of my own choosing.DecorThis isn't what you go for.ServiceThe staff are polite and the food harbingers (they're not wait staff, but they're also certainly not just bus boys) are wonderfully skilled at bringing a whole village's feast in one go.FoodSticky wings. They're sized for a real meal, delightfully tender and always delicious. I have never, ever, ever been disappointed with them! Texas sized drinks. With wine. And a shot.All other menu items, while enjoyable, are tertiary.I've probably been to Dallas BBQ more times than just about any other restaurant I frequent, and I don't expect to stop soon.",0
"Central location in great area off Spring St. We opted for indoor dining but the outdoor seating looked lovely and cute; looks like an equally good option, based on some reviews here. Indoor dining is well spaced with plastic separators between tables. Came here for weekday lunch. Very fair price for quantity and quality of food.  Plus there are daily lunch specials. Got the grilled octopus with burrata and fussolini with langostine. Service was very consistent and attentive. Definitely recommend.",0
I ordered their chicken adana on pita bread from mealpal and it was good. This was the first time I tried their food and was impressed. The food was ready when I got there and it was warm and fresh. They also had complimentary baklava aa dessert. The baklava was really good. I will be back to try their other dishes. Found a new place for lunch.,0
"I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good food or great service. The food was mediocre and the service was really bad. We had to wait a long time for our food and it wasn't very good either. We also paid a lot for our meal, which wasn't worth it in my opinion.",1
"I love this restaurant! The Matador Combo is always my go-to order and it's always delicious. The wait isn't bad even for large parties and the service is always good. I took a star away because in the last two visits, the chicken looks slightly pink in areas like it wasn't cooked to its full potential. Other than that, great quick Peruvian food if you're in the city.",1
"Food was ok it's good enuff for the price you pay, they always open outdoor even before the Covid19. Huge space in the back so more room for 25% capacity. Service was very slow but they are nice and work hard. Food also come out a little slow as well. Drink mad strong tho those are a plus;)",0
"This Ukrainian Russian restaurant is definitely worth a visit! The service was great and the food was also quite good. However, I think it could use some more variety when it comes to the entrees. That being said, the sides are a nice touch and definitely help round out the meal. I would rate this spot 4 out of 5 stars.",1
"Was really unimpressed by the food. Service was good so it gets two stars. Unfortunately it's not my favorite, I've had better Latin food at a similar price point",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, making it great for dates or a friendly get-together. The service is efficient and friendly, and the food here is always delicious. We started with the cold pea soup and it was the best I've ever had! My husband got the special lamb vindaloo pie and I got the fish & chips. Both dishes were delicious and cooked perfectly. We also stopped by for happy hour and the scotch egg was perfect. The beer and wine selection was also good here. I'll definitely be back to try the other foods on the menu!",1
"I've been to here twice and when I came the second time I have decided that this place is just mediocre especially for the price and how bland the food is. I ordered the grilled chicken, tomatoes, red onions and arugula dosa with cilantro chutney and it came out to be $15 something. The outside layer itself tasted burnt and bitter, even though it was not burnt. The filing was dry and the chicken itself was really dry. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The location is perfect - right next to all the happening spots in the area. Plus, the pizza is really good. I was really full after just one slice. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high, but it's definitely worth it. I'll definitely be back!",1
"Satisfactory chocolate milkshake inside Chelsea Market.Creamline is an American diner styled eatery inside Chelsea Market. It's cute and has multiple tables and counter tops, which is more than you can say for some of the other food options inside the market.The chocolate milkshake is just OK - its exactly what you'd expect of a chocolate milkshake! It's thick, tastes like chocolate, and there's a nice helping of fudge drizzled around the cup. It didn't feel particularly special, but it satisfied my craving for a milkshake while I was in the area. I'd recommend sharing it with another person, because it felt like a lot of milkshake to drink. It would be nice if they offered a half size version.For the price of $8+, I thought it might come in a prettier cup or something (not that it really matters at the end of the day). I didn't really like the paper straw at first, but it didn't crumble or dissolve like I expected.",0
"Ordered in from Taverna Kyclades this past Friday, after four years...here are my thoughts:On the plus side, portions are very large. My husband and daughter loved the chicken and the rice. The complimentary bread was also very good.On the not-so-great side, the sole was absolutely disgusting. It tasted like it was not fresh and/or microwaved. I literally couldn't eat it and had to throw the nearly $30 dish in the trash. The lemon potatoes were just okay. We are obviously in the minority as there are so many positive reviews here but we definitely won't be returning or ordering take out again. I'd much rather pay more and get better quality from Avra.",0
"An old favorite, Cookshop is always packed. It has been going strong in Chelsea for well over 20 years. Once cutting edge, it is now just good solid food. You will always have an enjoyable, even if not particularly creative, meal. Their other restaurants - Shuka, Vic's -- are more creative. All very good. Expect a wait if you are going for Sunday brunch.",0
I had a great time at Cafe Du Nord. The coffee and pastries are a must have! The atmosphere is buzzing and the staff are always friendly and efficient. I definitely recommend it for a quick morning bite.,1
"Los Tacos No. 1 is a decent iteration of classic tacos, but a terrible space and disappointing meat and guacamole. Quality was decent, but no where near the level of the hype. I tried three different tacos, Carne Asada, Pollo Asado, and Adobado, each on Corn Tortillas Con Todo. The Pollo Asado just was not good at all. Overwhelming with a burnt flavor and lifeless chicken, The Adobado was fine, but I expected it to be more flavorful. Only the Carne Asada really had that kick and taste I was looking for, but it was still a bit overdone. Also, I don't know what was going on with the guacamole, but the liquid mess was just not great. Quantity was depending on how hungry you are, two to three Tacos are needed. Value was $3.50 to $4 for a Taco depending on the protein. Ambiance was Los Tacos No. 1 is located in Chelsea Market in Manhattan. Little more than a stand with a bar area, it is a packed and uncomfortable space. They had a music battle with the shop next door, that created this vortex of noise. You order at the front then",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at Grub Hub. The food was cold and late, and the quality was really poor. The best part was the appetizer, Roti Canai, but the rest of my meal was not very good. The flat noodle dish always seems to lack the egg, and neither that nor the red curry was satisfying. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at Lil' Frankie's! The restaurant was packed and we had to wait a little bit for a counter seat, but it was worth it. I ordered the gnocchi and pizza and I was really happy with both. The gnocchi was soft and delicious, and the cheese on top was very fresh and tasty. I didn't love the pizza as much, though. It was a little burnt and the middle was a bit soggy. But overall, it was a great meal. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to other people.",1
"I came here several years ago and fell in love with their peanut dumplings. I had a craving of these dumplings and they did not disappoint. These dumplings come in two flavors: chicken and vegetarian, I settled for the chicken tonight and it was tasty as I remembered it when I first had it over 5 years ago. I tried to go keto and ordered the BBQ pork shoulder aka moo yang, which was good but flawed. The pork pieces were huge and not completely cut. The dipping sauce was not as good as Ayada and Dek Sen. Service was accommodating and effective but i also felt rushed. If I am in the area I would return to try their popular Pad Thai.",0
"Joe's Pizza is a reliable standby for New York style pizza. Apparently, a lot of famous people have come here, so it must be a draw for some people. The slices are huge, and I can usually get full on one and only need two if I'm super hungry. The toppings are pretty basic - just cheese, white, pepperoni, meat, and margherita (though with spinach instead of basil). There's not a lot of seating, and inside is standing room only. This is a grab and go kind of place.",1
"Wow, wow, wow!! Our last full day in NYC and just loved all the food choices in Chelsea Market as we stumbled across this place and wow, was it worth it!!Went with the lunch special with sushi and dumplings. We did a Smokey jack and mighty mushroom sushi which were both incredible and then the dumplings which were amazing - Fun Guy and Kale Yeah! They were delicious - just amazing !!That honestly would have been enough but the dips sounded too good so we tried the fava been dip and taro chips - so good!!The food was amazing, the gentleman working there was so nice and helpful and it was so filling but completely delicious!! Loved it !!",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good. The tots were my favorite, and the wings were a bit disappointing - they were very soggy. The delivery was on time, and the food was well-packaged. I would order from them again.",1
I had a great experience dining at Nerei restaurant. The food was delicious and the delivery was very clean and organized. I appreciated the hard work and excellent food that was delivered. Great job!,1
"If I could give this restaurant 10 stars, I would! I have been coming to this restaurant for a few years now for its high end asian-fusion cuisine and cool atmosphere. Last night was extra amazing! I came here in-between seeing Parts 1 and 2 of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway. When I made the reservation online, it specifically asked if we had theatre tickets. I think that is great that they ask because we did not have tons of time before Part 2. They assured us we would be in and out in plenty of time!

Ok, now onto the amazing food and drink I consumed last night! I had the strawberry ginger bellini to drink. It was the prettiest pink color and tasted as good as it looked. The ginger flavor was prominent, but not overpowering and combined perfectly with the strawberry and prosecco. We got the pan seared vegetable dumplings appetizer. These were the best dumplings I have ever had! They were perfectly seared, super flavorful, and had this cool crispy thing over the top (see the picture! It was so good but I have no idea what it was!). I would order these again and again!

For my entree, I",1
"Blossom on Columbus is a great restaurant for brunch. They take your temperature and have hand sanitizer at every table. They use QR code menus. The restaurant is large with spacious booths and they have some plastic walls in between tables which I appreciated. We ordered the crispy artichokes which were great. The lemon aioli sauce that it comes with is fantastic; very citrusy and tangy. We got a small side cup of it to have with our mains because it was so good. The artichokes are yummy as well. Very buttery and flaky. They melt in your mouth. For entrees, we had the huevos rancheros and the southern seitan sandwich. The sandwich was amazing. The seitan was crispy and had a great texture. The sauce was flavorful and the focaccia bread was buttery and fresh. It was also large and very filling. I didn't like the huevos rancheros very much. they do a good job of recreating the ""egg"" texture with tofu but the dish was cold and lacked flavor and spice. But the staff was super friendly and nice and service was great. I would come back!",1
"JeJu Noodle Bar is definitely a place worth checking out if you're in the area! The wait wasn't too long and we were seated at the counter which was quite cozy and gave us a great view of the kitchen. Our orders were Fried Chicken and So Ramyun. The Fried Chicken was definitely a different flavor profile and interesting dish to try once. The So Ramyun was also a delicious and filling dish. The only downside is that it wasn't necessarily worth the 1 Michelin star. However, the dishes are more unique compared to the many Korean restaurants in NYC.",1
"Amazing atmosphere, great food and drinks. Music is chill but not too loud. It's a great vibe.",0
"Food great, service so-so. I walk by this place ALL the time and have been wanting to try it for a while so glad that I finally did. It gets a little confusing outside because there is a restaurant next door that looks exactly like it and there is someone outside peddling you to go in there, but it is NOT the same restaurant (you will notice that even though they look identical, that one is empty). Curious as to the story behind it...It's BYOB but luckily there's a liquor store not too far but wish we realized that beforehand so we could have picked something up on the way rather than leave after we ordered. A lot of the things on the menu come as 1 piece/serving so when ordered to share, just be aware of that. The server definitely had us over ordering though because he said it wouldn't be enough. Needless to say we ordered WAY too much and ended up coming home with leftovers, which we still love, but probably would have not ordered quite so much. The ambiance is very fun and lively!",0
"UPDATE: So I finally was able to come back for a make-up lunch (from a somewhat disappointing experience some time ago) at Boucherie, and it was just lovely - tooootally redeemed itself! After just a little bit of confusion at the outset, I was promptly seated and introduced to Veli, the manager. He was super nice, gave me some great recommendations, and very attentive. For a drink, I opted for the Boucherie Old Fashioned (Buffalo Trace, Patron Anejo, Plum, Lavender, Lemon Oil) and it was a fantastically smooth and delicious start to the meal. For appetizer, I was pretty dead set on the steak tartare (with capers, shallots, parsley, and a quail egg - I was so looking forward to this and it did not disappoint! I loved the addition of the quail egg, kicking the dish up a notch on the indulgence factor. Served with some toasted bread (and a rationed some table bread as well just for this), it was a real treat.For my entree, while I was thinking about the filet, I landed back on the Boeuf Bourguignon...because that beef is so damn tender and flavorful!  With some leftovers being bagged, I didn't really feel like I could do a dessert justice, so I decided to pass on any further indulgences and try to walk some of this goodness off on my way back to grand central (but Veli even said dessert is on the house next time - a real swell guy). All in all, I had a great second visit to Boucherie Union Square and my faith has been restored (and the food has always been on point). Looking forward to visiting again soon!",0
"We absolutely loved our meal at Raku! The South Village location has a lot more seating than their other location, and we appreciated that. The niku udon, ebiten udon, and pressed mackerel dishes were all great, but our favorite was the niku udon. The beef broth was really rich and delicious, and the beef was cooked perfectly. The tripe was a bit of an acquired taste for us, but if you're not a fan, you can always give it away to your companions. The ebiten udon also had a great broth and came with shrimp and tempura vegetables. The pressed mackerel was also a tasty dish, with a smoky mackerel flavor and a bit too much rice. But overall, we were really happy with our meal at Raku. The gyoza and chicken kaarage apps were also really good. We'd definitely recommend trying their udon dishes if you're in the area!",1
"We ordered 4 rolls, 2 speciality and 2 regular rolls. Surprisingly, the regular rolls tasted way better than the speciality rolls. I guess that means the fish is good but they're various sauces and toppings aren't. I was looking forward to the up town hot girl roll since it was supposed to be spicy. I was hugely disappointed in that it was actually sweet. Sweet sushi is weird and doesn't taste good.",0
"I ordered take out from this restaurant and found that the ramen was way too salty. The flavors were more suited for a dip ramen. The miso ramen had a complex miso flavor, but the saltiness ruined it. The mayo pork donburi was okay- creamy and rice cooked perfectly. The packaging for the ramen worked well- separate containers for toppings, and a divided container for noodles and soup. The delivery was delayed because the restaurant was too busy, so the ramen arrived lukewarm. Karaage would have been good if it wasn't steamed in its own heat in a sealed container. There was no sauce to accompany either meal. The prices were also quite expensive.",1
"Line is long but moves relatively fast. My recommendation is to eat it nearby if you want it hot. Cooled off considerably by the time we walked the slices (in a box) back to the hotel. I liked the lack of tartness of the sauce. Mozzarella was good. Out of the three, the crust was burnt on one. If you are going to buy four slices, just buy the whole pie (8 slices) for twenty-thirty depending on toppings. The closest chain pizza place with the same texture dough is California pizza kitchen.",0
"My family ordered food from this restaurant for my dad's birthday, and I loved the food. The hummus was some of the best hummus I've had in The States since my trip to Israel, the vegetables were delicious, and I loved the tahini sauce. I don't know what the green sauce was called on the side in the little containers. It was extremely spicy and so good. I would buy a bottle of this if the restaurant sold it. The delivery was quick and efficient. Everything in the order was included, and I couldn't have been happier with the experience. I even came in for seconds. I really hope to come here again soon.",0
"Went on Saturday afternoon for happy hour (5-7) and enjoyed some drinks and food. Everything was delicious. We had the chicken flautas, carnitas tacos, queso fundido with chorizo and tuna ceviche. For drinks we had rosarita and maya margarita both delicious, we also ordered a beer ""Chelada""Which is a traditional Mexican way of having beer, with lime juice and a salt ring and we were surprised or server didn't know what it was, but we explained to him. The size of everything we ordered was small, the tacos too, smaller than regular size tortillas. I would advise to order at least 2-3 dishes per person if you want to try different flavors,  or just go for the regular menu and order a regular dish, at the end price wise it's gonna be the same or even a better deal.Service was good, music, drinks and food was well prepared and everything very tasty. Would probably come back to try their entrees and some other drinks. They also offer unlimited brunch with a variety of drinks and food so this might be our next visit.",0
Came back again this past Easter and was slightly disappointed. I made my reservation through yelp and the yelp notification said that all reservations through yelp would be outside. Given that day was a bit chilly I called the restaurant to see if I'd be able to switch my reservation to be seated indoors. The person that picked up the phone assured me it would be no problem and that my reservation was actually inside anyway. I get to the restaurant and I'm greeted by who I'm assuming is the manager and he started to walk my group to the seating outside. I stopped him and let him know that I had spoke to someone and they assured me that I was being sat inside. He looked at me very confused and said there are no seats and that he would go talk to the woman I spoke to. He comes back to tell me that the hostess claims she never spoke to anyone and never said I was being sat inside????? Safe to say I was pretty annoyed that this person literally lied about speaking to me on the phone but the manager honestly handled it like a champ suddenly found my party a table inside. The restaurant clearly can't function when things get too busy because there was also a celebrity there eating with his family that was also really annoyed about something. Our food took a very long time to come out and since I was already annoyed about the hostess lying  I was pretty disappointed this time around. I still love this place and am thankful for the managers understanding but there definitely needs to be some kind of cap on reservations so that the place doesn't get overwhelmed.,0
"I had a good lunch at this restaurant. The prices were reasonable, and the waitress was very friendly. The only downside was that I couldn't have shellfish, so I had to make a few substitutions. The Hungry set I got had shrimp substituted with toro and scallion and blue crab with ikura salmon. They also ran out of yellowtail, so I got a substitute for spicy scallops. Everything else I got was from the Sets menu, which included rice and seaweed. The rice was nicely seasoned and everything tasted fresh. The seaweed layer was not as crispy as I would like, but overall, I thought it was a decent option for handrolls. I was pretty full from 4 handrolls. Tips and tax were not included, but they offer them at other handroll spots.",1
"Finally got a chance to give this place a try after seeing the hype on Instagram and a line of about 20 deep out the door. Fortunately, the line moved quickly and I was able to get my pizza about 5 minutes after I ordered. I had the vodka, pear and pepperoni squares during my first visit. Upon first glance, I noticed that the squares were noticeably blackened and charred. Not sure if this was done intentionally, but there were sure were a lot reviews concerning the burnt crusts on Yelp. I also couldn't sworn I tasted a little blood after trying to chew the hardened crust. I think everything would've tasted a lot better if the crust was softer and not as charred. I thought the vodka square was the best out of the 3 I had. The sauce was flavorful and the herbs definitely complemented everything deliciously. Second place goes to the pepperoni square. It's comparable to Prince Street Pizza's Spicy Spring, just a lot more charred. Last place goes to the pear. I thought this Square was pretty flavorless given that there was no tomato sauce. Overall, give Mamas Too a shot if you haven't already and/or if you're in the area. I can't say that they have the best pizza in NYC, but maybe I'll come back for their seasonal squares whenever they offer them?",0
"Los Tacos No 1 is a great place to get tacos. The line moves quickly, and the tacos are very tasty. The only downside is that they are a bit expensive, but worth it. You can also customize your tacos in advance, which is a nice feature.",1
"The sandwiches here are huge and really heavy, so be prepared to feel full after eating just a half of one. The Caprese sandwich is a classic, and I really enjoyed it - the pesto was full of flavor and it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet. The Ill Papa sandwich was also really good - it had a perfect balance of flavors and was really filling. However, the Spicy Salami sandwich was a bit of a let-down for me - it was really greasy and the salami was too spicy for my taste. I would recommend it, but only if you're in the mood for something spicy.",1
"I had a great time at Floret! The restaurant is cute and uncrowded, which was perfect for a large party. Our server was super friendly and attentive. They have a great happy hour that ends at 7, and the menu changes seasonally. I had the brisket which was good but a bit salty. I would like to see a bit more variety on the menu- especially wanted to try the squid ink pasta I saw in a photo. However, I would definitely come back for the happy hour or to try new offerings on the menu.",1
"Han Dynasty is a great place for spice seekers. The dishes like dry pot and tripe in chili oil are signature and delicious. The dumplings in chili oil were unmemorable, but the wings were addictive. The atmosphere is middle of the road, but I like the lighting and there's a nice buzz from the crowd. The service was quick. Overall, I wasn't wowed by my first visit, but I'll give them a few more tries as there must be some secret sauce here.",1
"My party and I had a great experience at Wokuni for dinner. The restaurant was flexible with our reservation time and we were seated quickly. The ambiance was very pleasant, with nice decor and not overly loud (despite being crowded!). The front section of the restaurant also has a fish market and items are imported from Japan. We ordered the Sashimi (five kinds, 15 pieces), Tori Nyu Men, and Salmon Don / Porridge. The sashimi was amazing - super fresh and high quality! I would definitely recommend trying this - it reminded me of fresh sashimi in Japan and is very fairly priced. The set also has a very aesthetic presentation, so it's great if you're into taking food photos. The Nyu Men noodles were quite good, but the broth was on the salty side. The salmon don / porridge we ordered was actually different from the photos on Yelp (didn't see photos of it prior to ordering). The waiter explained that we should try it in three ways: first, as it was; second, with the seasonings provided; and third, with the broth (don't use too much). The portion was generous and, as a salmon lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this! For dessert, we opted to try the Matcha Brulee and Dora- and Tai-Yaki. I am a huge fan of matcha, so I was pleasantly surprised when the brulee was stronger than expected. The Dorayaki was also great (matcha again with red bean). I was a little bit less impressed by the Taiyaki, but the presentation was cute. Overall, we had a great experience here. The one caveat is the service - it was rather slow towards the end of our meal, but the restaurant was really crowded.",0
"Little Mad is a restaurant that is known for its fish shaped scallion pancake and its yellowtail. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy my experience here. The fish shaped scallion pancake was doughy and not crispy enough, and the yellowtail was delicious but well done. The scallion oil flavor profile was nothing new to me and it was good. The beef tartare was forgettable, and the kelp leaves a sticky gumminess in your mouth. The ""mad toast"" had summer truffles which were not very flavorful. The chicken or the egg was the worse dish, and it was basically a chicken wing. The American wagyu was the best dish, and it was perfectly cooked. The vegetable wraps complemented it well. However, the rice with bone marrow was fine but nothing special. The green tea dessert at the end was good and not too sweet. The service was good, and you can tell they actually know the menu. There was one confusing moment when he tried to explain that they were taking off the wagyu soon and had kalbi as an option. I would not come back to Little Mad nor would I recommend it. I would go to their sister restaurant Jua.",1
"I visited Hop Kee restaurant for the first time in years and was delighted to find that the food was still as delicious as ever. I ordered plenty of dishes to celebrate the Year of the Tiger and was not disappointed. My personal favourites were the dumplings, beef chow fun and shrimp. The only dish I didn't particularly enjoy was the fried pork chops which were a bit tough and not very seasoned. The service was great and I was happy to see that people were starting to come back to Chinatown. I would definitely recommend Hop Kee for authentic Chinese food.",1
I visited this restaurant for the first time and it was a great experience. The atmosphere was inviting and the staff was very friendly. I sat by the bar and enjoyed my drink. The food was also good. I would definitely return and try some of the other menu options.,1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The delivery was packaged very well and arrived quickly. I ordered the spicy basil chicken and it was very spicy and full of grilled veggies. I also ordered the Thai spring rolls and they were hot and crispy. My favorite dish was the chicken curry puffs. They were seasoned so well and had a light flaky outer crust. The sauces with the spring rolls and curry puffs were both really flavorful. I also got spicy potatoes and they were good, but they were in a thick sauce and not my favorite texture. I loved their Thai iced tea. I would definitely try this place again!",1
"This has become a frequent lunch spot for Cuban food in Times Square. Today Abinael was our waiter and his upbeat energy was contagious. Super attentive and helpful, he was always filling out water and checking in.",0
"My first outdoor dining experience since the reopening!Ricky and Eric were the servers that night and they were amazing! The restaurant practiced social distancing and the staffs were wearing masks with hand sanitizer available for customers.What attracted me to this place initially was the crispy pig ears on the menu! Was thinking about just ordering in but the paella is only available if you dine at the restaurant, so make sure you go there in person to support the restaurant!Portions were very generous and everything was delicious (pig eats, black rice paella, tostones). Dessert was on the house as a birthday treat! Bravo!Will definitely return again!",0
"I recently visited Chloe in Soho, and it was just as delicious as I remembered! The light meal we ordered was perfect for sharing, and the quinoa salad was refreshing and addictive. The lemonade was also very unique and refreshingly good. I loved the minty cucumber flavor. Compared to the Soho location, this place had more open space and was less crowded. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a healthy meal option as well as instagrammable food for the younger generation.",1
"This was our first time having dim sum not in Chinatown and we were honestly very pleasantly surprised! We were able to get a table after waiting just a couple of minutes on a rainy day (there was one table out for outdoor seating but the rain kept it empty) and the staff was really kind to us.FOOD:+ Crab & pork soup dumplings -- solid, I'll admit I had kind of low expectations that these exceeded+ Chicken feet -- these taste a bit different from what I was expecting but they were still tasty+ Pork & century egg congee -- exactly what we needed coming in from the rain+ Shrimp dumplings & Chou Zhou w/ vegetables, seafood, and peanut dumplings+ Sweet sesame balls for dessert!Even though staff seemed spread thin among tables, we were attended often and got great service. One moment that sticks out to me was towards the end of my meal, when I was trying to finish up my glass of hot water like I usually do before leaving a restaurant. The waiter saw my glass was near empty and offered to refill it but I told him it wasn't necessary but thanks. He insisted and gave me a refill anyway, after also refilling my partner's ice water, and so I got to be REAL hydrated on my way out of the restaurant hehe",0
"The Handpulled Noodle is a restaurant that is definitely worth checking out! The bowls of spicy (tingly) broth with hand-pulled ribbon noodles and lamb are delicious and definitely cure what ails you. The dumplings are also a great addition to the meal, and the window-view counter is a great place to sit and watch Broadway go by.",1
"I was so happy to hear about Fieldtrip's opening in Midtown, and I was not disappointed when I finally visited this new outpost. The rice bowls are definitely a highlight here, as the rice is unbleached and not enriched, which gives it a consistent and distinctive flavor. I tried the BBQ Brisket bowl and it was spicier than I expected, with small red chili slices, chipotle black beans, brown rice, and hoisin sauce. It was so consistently flavored that even the rice at the bottom was well-seasoned! I also tried my friend's Crispy Chicken bowl, which featured Carolina Gold fried rice and fried chicken chunks, but I preferred mine. I've previously had the Shrimp bowl and Quinoa Bao Buns, which are both definitely worth trying out!",1
"This is not the spot if you're looking for fancy, bourgeois, artisan pizza. But if you want delicious, authentic, quick, cheap, and yummy pizza- it is your spot! It's very unassuming, to say the least. No place to sit, just a few tables outside to stand and eat your pizza. But if the line is any indication, this pizza is legit! Cheese slices are just $1, and those with toppings are about $4.50-$5. Slices are large, hearty, and 2 will FILL you up. The crust is perfect, soft enough to be folded, and the cheese and toppings are perfect. I'm glad I got my first authentic pizza at 2 Bros!",0
Kunming beef noodle soup is pretty good and the beef was really tender. Not the best in the village but a lot better than lots of stores.Mouthwatering chicken - mini portion but very good and love the flavor Street Potato - good flavor Wonton in chili oil - really was not good. The skin is very thick and the stuffing has no taste. Also it's not spicy at all.Luckily their homemade spicy sauce was spicy and really good. I added into everything I was eating.Also tried the Mu Gua shui which I thought its something tasted like papaya but I guess it's nothing related to papaya? It was good though!,0
"I don't recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good tacos. The wait is really long, and the staffs are really rude. The food here is also not very good - I would recommend going to Brooklyn's el bronco instead. Additionally, the male manager looked at me really disrespectfully when I asked for salsa verde - it was really unpleasant. I don't think I'll be returning here anytime soon.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The party of seven that I was with had a great time ordering our food and drinks. The entrées were all delicious and the prices were fair. The only downside to our outing was that it was a bit too expensive for my taste. The waiter was very attentive and prompt, but I felt like the wait time for our food and drinks was a bit long. The bathrooms were definitely private and luxurious, and I really liked that about the place. I would recommend this restaurant to others!",1
"Vaucluse is another restaurant (newish I believe?) from chef Michael White of Marea. I'd been to Marea before and wanted to try this place for awhile, especially because of its chic dining room. So my friends and I picked this place for a girls' Christmas lunch on a Sunday. We came in at around 1pm, with a party of four. We were seated immediately, and brought copies of the menu and waters. I noted that the dining room was certainly every bit as impressive as it looked in pictures, with an all-white, carpeted interior, large windows that let the natural light in, and white cushioned booths. Within a few moments, we ordered, with just one thing to share as an appetizer, and separate main dishes for each of us. The wait time for our appetizer (leeks) was average for a New York restaurant. We had been brought slices of complimentary bread and butter while waiting also. The leeks were garnished with crushed nuts, and contained the flavor of a strong olive oil. It was not terrible, but not remarkable either. Our main dishes were presented shortly. Myself and a friend both had the Niçoise salad- for a salad, this was quite good, with generous pieces of lightly seared, fresh tuna, amidst hard boiled egg slices and greens. Our two other friends had the epaulettes and chicken paillard - both remarked that their dishes were delicious. Vaucluse has a classically French dessert menu, and some of the girls opted to share an eclair, which they were both pleased with. Service was impeccable and prices were standard with New York restaurants. I suspect their dinner menu might contain more elaborate dishes than the brunch menu, and would come back to try a meal at a different time. Would recommend for a long lunch/dinner.",0
"I can see why this place is packed. The restaurant has a great open decor with a cool looking bar. The tables have a reclaimed wood look. But ...I had the skirt steak entree which has a side of miniature potatoes and arugula. The issue I had with this restaurant was the portion sizes and the lack of attention from our waitress. Although the dish was ok despite a lack of seasoning (the main flavor was lemon), the skirt steak amounted to four slivers. The arugula didn't have any dressing and was thrown on top of the potatoes, hiding that they were even there. I also had the Expresso Tiramisu, which was half the size of what I am accustomed to at Italian Restaurants. Portion sizes at Italian restaurants usually are over abundant. Not here. I left hungry. Maybe I didn't order enough but I did have calamari, which was also less than half the size of other places. But our waitress was not attentive in the least way. Where do I begin? She approached our table and asked ""Do you know what you want?"", never telling us the specials. She never came back and finally after we had cleaned our plates, she came by and said "" You good?"". I rolled my eyes and said can I see the dessert menu. I could have left this crowded establishment without anyone noticing. I stood up trying to get my waitress' attention to finally walk up to someone for help. And if you are wondering if, we did hear the waiter next to us tell the table the specials. This place is too expensive for what we received. $120 and I am going to get pizza! I don't recommend nor will I return.",0
"The chicken sandwich was a decent meal - fresh and fried, with pickles on the side. The only downside was that it was a bit small, but otherwise it was a decent sandwich. The service was also good, with the bartender being warm and accommodating. Overall, I had a decent lunch experience at this restaurant.",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We both got the shrimp tacos and they were amazing. The only downside was that the drinks took a little longer to come than we'd like, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"The pizza at this restaurant was decent, but it was a bit overpriced. I appreciated that they had vegan cheese on their menu, and the crust was thin, which is the name of the game at this place. The cashier was very friendly and helpful, and there was a girl in the back making drinks who started to rub her belly. I couldn't confirm if she changed her gloves or not, but she went to the back so I couldn't see that. Overall, I thought the staff was attentive and clean, but I would suggest that they take better care of the food they're handling, especially since there are people eating here.",1
"I love this restaurant! They have multiple vegan options (including a savory and a sweet vegan chicken curry bowl), fresh and good quality chutney, and perfect balance and ratio of cucumber salad to brown rice and vegan chicken curry in the bowl. The food is ready quickly, but I wish they sold full bottles of the chutney.",1
"I stopped into Natsumi Tapas with my boyfriend after work on a Friday night and had a great time! The restaurant was decently crowded, but we were able to be seated without a wait which was nice. The service was friendly & prompt. Our waiter came over right away and offered us some drinks & edamame, so we ordered a beer, a glass of wine, and some spicy edamame ($5.25) to start while looking at the menu. There are SO many dishes to select from. It probably took us 15 minutes to narrow down our choices. We weren't super hungry, so we shared a tuna avocado roll ($6.50), crunchy spicy salmon roll ($6.75), rock shrimp tempura ($9.75), and crispy calamari ($8.95) - Everything was very tasty. The sushi was very fresh, and hot tapas were crispy, fried, and yummy. We really enjoyed the spicy peanut dipping sauce that came with the calamari. Our meal came to about $60 w/o tip, which isn't bad for dinner & drinks in NYC and we left totally satisfied. We live in the area & plan to come back again soon to try some of the more adventurous dishes on the",1
"We went to this restaurant for the tasting menu and were not impressed. We called ahead and let them know that we didn't want the shellfish, but they replaced the shellfish with a vegetarian dish anyway. The replacement wasn't too bad, but the steak was terrible. We didn't enjoy the meal at all and would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I stopped into Gaea for lunch the other day and overall it was a pretty good experience. The octopus was especially great - it was cooked to perfection and really tasted fantastic. Additionally, the cauliflower was also really tasty and I really enjoyed the sweetbreads as well.

However, I did have two complaints. My first dish - the chicken - was overcooked and didn't taste very good, and my second dish - the salad - was also a bit overcooked and not as flavorful as I would've liked. Overall, I would say it's a pretty good restaurant with delicious food, but I would recommend ordering smaller portions if you're looking to try it out.",1
"I was very very confused as to how Set had 4 stars..... This may be the only time an overall Yelp rating has tricked me into trying out a restaurant..... The only reasons for my 2-star rating was the quick & friendly service, and affordable prices. The food and drinks are subpar, period.

I went to Set with a few girlfriends for drinks & dinner after work on a Friday. We ordered the Set Loaded Tots & Tempura Shrimp poppers to share. The tots had wayyyy too many toppings & flavors going on (just didn't work well - sometimes less is more) and the shrimp was definitely straight out of the bag (comparable to the precooked frozen baby shrimps I buy from my local grocery store) topped with some sort of spicy mayo sauce; nothing special. We also each ordered one of their ""Sets"" as our meals. Each Set comes with one slider, one skewer, and waffle fries. Honestly, this wasn't anything to write home about either. My slider (beef) was extremely chewy, although my pork belly skewer was tasty. All in all, the place is a bit divey and the food is nothing to write home about.",1
"We went back for a second visit last night on a particularly cold night in need of some warm ramen soup.It's not a huge place or a particularly pretty place, but going the reviews, we thought it was worth checking out.Overall, most things were good. The service was good, albeit a bit hard to push through since the server didn't speak English. But it wasn't really a hindrance. The soup was actually really amazing ramen. We both had the spicy ramen for the second time. Prices were great.Where they lost me and two stars is that it's not a very clean place and last night towards the end of our meal we could hear the bug zapper in the kitchen go off every 45 second to a minute.Places get flies. I know. But given the uncleanliness of the place that suddenly became apparent, listening to bugs being zapped while eating was just too much for my tastes.Sadly, I don't see going back.",0
"I had a fantastic meal at The Smith restaurant last night. The kale and quinoa salad was unreal, and I can't get enough of it. The butternut squash schneckel was also fantastic, and my mom really enjoyed her meal too. We were so impressed with the food that we decided to come back today, and there was definitely a lot of competition on the menu. I'm definitely going to have to try a lot of the other items too!",1
"This is a good place to go to if you have a party who wants a bunch of different things and has trouble deciding on what to order.Pros: the interior is cool. You forget that you're in midtown and think you might be downtown instead. The service is also quite fast. Cons: the ramen is solid but I was disappointed that the egg came out hard boiled and wasn't poached as I've normally come to expect an egg served in ramen. Also, there was only one piece of pork belly in the whole bowl. I wish that our dishes were served at the same time and not one by one. Some of our dishes ended up staying on the table until everyone else was served, which can be uncomfortable for everyone to wait and not eat what's in front of them. I also wish that sushi was served individually by order, not all together on one plate. This caused some confusion and resulted in having to place an order for another roll. Our experience was overall good and I would keep it in mind when looking for a quick bite in midtown.",0
"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on the good reviews, but unfortunately my last two meals here were disappointing. The Bussan Pancake was really good though. I also liked the pork belly kimchi stew. My only complaint is that the meats were cooked together too much and ended up being too fatty. The waiters also stopped coming by to check on us after the meats were done cooking, so I couldn't get more water. Overall, I'm still glad I visited, but I might not come back because of my recent experiences.",1
"Overall, the experience was good. The service was hit or miss, but the bartenders were attentive and had good senses of humor. The sangria was tasty. The downside is that it can be difficult to get service when you first sit down, so it may be worth making a reservation.",1
"Taqueria is a great place for a casual night out with friends. The atmosphere is really fun and the food is delicious and cheap. The only downside is that it can be a bit noisy, but that's to be expected in a bar like this. The service was great and the bartender was really friendly and engaging. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a casual night out.",1
"I was mildly disappointed in this popular bottomless brunch spot. The service was extremely slow -- we didn't get our drinks until 20+ mins after ordering, and was even more delayed on the food. Giving it 3 stars for the incredible guacamole & chips, but even the brunch entrees were just average.



We ordered the Spiced Calabaza + Bacon Guacamole - definitely recommend! Really fresh and good. For entree, ordered the Quesadilla Eggs Benny...definitely disappointing. Not much to it in either flavor or quantity. Drinks - we loved the frozen margs. Blood Mary was spicier than preferred.



Food: 2/5

Service/Speed: 2/5

Price (college student budget): $ (good deal for bottomless)

Ambiance: Casual, open space. Great atmosphere for big groups.

Would return & recommend? 3/5",1
"The Flower Shop is a great place to catch up with friends. The decor is super cozy and comfy, and the staff is friendly and jazzy. I wasn't here for the food, but I'm sure it's good too. Overall, I'm very pleased with this spot.",1
"Wait what???  10 pork and chive dumplings for $4???  They were making the dumpling dough as we sat there.  Who could ask for better.  They melt in your mouth.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200.  Go directly to King!",0
"Quite surprised about the rating, but to each their own.   Went on Grubhub looking for delivery and ran across this place.   I decided to give it a try and ordered a Loco Moco bowl and was very satisfied with the dish!  Reminds me of like Salisbury steak with rice, sunny side up eggs, with corn.   Definitely will get food from here again in the future",0
"Overall, we had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was good and presentation was excellent. However, I was a bit disappointed with the $30 prix fixe - I would have preferred a bit more variety in the dishes. The credit card fee was a bit surprising, but it wasn't a deal breaker.",1
"Quality has gone down in the past few years. I ordered the Pad Thai again, but this time, I asked if they could make it spicy. Apparently to them, this just means to add extra salt/fish sauce. I was only able to eat half before my tongue started to get numb from all the sodium, and I didn't want it to fall off. I paid $18 (including tax and tip) for some Bad Thai. On the flip side, my colleague ordered the chow fun and said it was bland AF. Guess they saved all the salt for my dish.Wei West was the go-to for team outtings since it is close to the office and can usually seat large groups (I say usually because this past time we went, our group of ten was seated by the sushi bar, even though we made reservations ahead of time). Kind of defeats the whole purpose of a team lunch. Will be looking for a new spot next time.",0
"Since we came for restaurant week, we ordered off of the set menu. There could have been more choices for sure (2/3 of the appetizer options included mushroom soup and mushroom ravioli). The duck was the star of the show, and was very tender and served on fruity grains. The fish, on the other hand, was a disappointment - there was little other taste than the oil it had been cooked in, and it was not very hot. It did come with delicious braised fennel, though. The desserts were delicious, although a little too large for such a fancy restaurant. This is probably a better restaurant to come to not on restaurant week, as the people ordering off the set menu looked like they had better, fresher food.",0
"Think Dig Inn meets Asian food- clean, gourmet style bowls and bites with plenty of vegan optionsI couldn't resist checking out the Turnstyle Underground Market while getting off the train at Columbus circle. There are so many independent food stalls and little shops- it's definitely a fun place to stop.Hey Hey Canteen seemed like a healthy, flavorful dinner choice. The location is brand new. Seating is limited, definitely tough for a group but doable for a couple. We took our food to go and ate at home. They have several pre-set bowls and salads or you can make your own bowl. One of the most appealing things to me about the diy bowl was the option of sesame peanut noodles as the base. See ya later rice.My diy bowl ($13):-sesame peanut noodles (vegan)-yuzu brussel sprouts (vegan)-vegan kale Caesar (obvi vegan)-baked tofu with sweet chili sauce (vegan)My boyfriend's diy bowl ($15):-sesame peanut noodles (vegan)-yuzu brussel sprouts (vegan)-roasted tomatoes (vegan)-honey ginger salmon (vegan)All in all, we found it's a few dollars overpriced versus comparable meal options and could have used a bit more sauce/seasoning on the proteins, but it's tasty, filling, and pretty healthy. To be fair, we also are at home about an hour after. If the dishes were about $1.50 less or if the dishes really kicked up the flavor and elegance, this would be a compelling option.",0
"I had a great time at Bubba Gumps restaurant today! The wait wasn't too bad, and our server was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, and I especially enjoyed the strawberry salad entree. My husband and all of our kids loved their meals as well. I only wish they had Forrest Gump trivia available, as that was one of the things that made my last visit to the restaurant so memorable. All in all, a great experience!",1
"I've been here three times, twice for lunch with a colleague and also once during the evening for dinner with my fiancé and to watch the fight. Each of menu items I have ordered have been delicious. However, I do have to say that I'll have to take away one star for the TV situation. After all they advertised UFC 241 all over their windows, but had pop music blasting through the fights, even up until the main card and their tv kept crashing and flickering on and off making it a pretty frustrating watching experience. Felt like they were trying to do too much, be a restaurant, bar and club all at the same time. We know next time to go to Dave and Busters for an event but will definitely be going back to FWPH for the food and drinks in the future.",0
I had a great time at Westville last night! The food was delicious and the portions were perfect. I especially loved their market plate - it's great for vegetarians and vegans. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a healthy meal.,1
"Tame, tame, tame. Was SOOOO excited for a night out at Kings Co Imperial and much to my chagrin, it was so darn pedestrian that I left downtrodden and disappointed. The eggplant had no zip, the dumplings barely zagged. The ""red chili"" calamari has virtually no chilies and certainly wasn't red (just deep fried breaded calamari that you might find at a diner or fast food place with a hint of seasoning)...it also didn't taste terribly fresh and included lots of bits that are usually tossed or at least trimmed during the cleaning process. The pork belly was devoid of pork, just large squares of chewy, inedible fat.Cocktails were ok but the mai tai had a mountain of ice and thus got watered down before it even hit the table. Service was slow, some dishes we ordered never even arrived (but thankfully so, since the food wasn't very good anyway).Like walk on the really tame side for those who may have never had anything particularly Sichuan or even-Sichuan adjacent and want to try something slightly different but definitely, DEFINITELY not outside of a very narrow comfort zone.  Not impressed.",0
"I highly recommend visiting this pub if you're in the area! The turkey club was delicious, and my friend really enjoyed her steak sandwich. The pub itself is really small and seating is close, but it's not at all uncomfortable. The staff was really friendly and responsive, and the wait time wasn't too long. Overall, I had a really enjoyable experience!",1
"I had a great time at Mamoun's Falafel! The food was really tasty and cheap, and the late night atmosphere was great. I especially loved the chicken shawarma and the falafel. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite crowded, so it was hard to get a seat. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty and affordable bite to eat.",1
"I ordered delivery from this restaurant through DoorDash and the food was not good. The grilled chicken spicy basil udon has an odd taste to it - like they put ketchup and sugar in the sauce. The chicken also tastes really artificial. The Taro dessert, on the other hand, is much denser than I thought.",1
"The one on the left. Late night dinner on a Monday, crowded and a bit of a wait. Service was a little slow / indifferent. Also I'm a believer in first come first serve and we were passed up a few times over some other parties that came after us for ordering and drinks. Maybe our (well behaved) kids were killing their super cool restaurant vibe. Food was tasty. Got the beef with sticky rice, chicken pad Thai, spicy eggplant with veggies ( instead of a protein), kahsol and mango sticky rice. Everything was tasty, probably a notch above all the standard Thai food places in terms of quality and flavor. We'd hit it up again.",0
I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The chicken adana on pita bread was delicious. It was ready when I arrived and the pita bread was warm and fresh. They also had complimentary baklava as a dessert. The baklava was very good. I will definitely be back to try their other dishes.,1
"I don't know why I keep hoping the food here will eventually be good...it never is. My last visit I tried the lasagna, yuck. It was bland, unseasoned, and tasteless. How do you go wrong on lasagna? Come on! The service, atmosphere, and food presentation are great. I really wish they would improve their food.",0
"Excellent service in a clean open and bright venue. Had only lattes and Irish coffee, so can't wait to get back for brunch or some eats!",0
"I was looking forward to trying Very Thai's food because of the positive reviews, but I had an unpleasant phone call and never got my order :(I placed an order a day in advance for noon on Tuesday, but on Monday after 1 pm, I received a call from a delivery person. I explained that I wasn't there to pick up the food as I had ordered it for the following day. A few hours later, I received a call from someone who insisted that I cancel the order as they had ""already lost money trying to deliver food that day because the delivery guy didn't bring the food back"" and would not deliver the food on Tuesday. When I explained that the restaurant had attempted to deliver the order on the wrong day, she said that they didn't have the delivery slip anymore because it was with the food. (I checked the Seamless order after the call; the date was Tuesday, as I intended.)It didn't really make sense that they wanted me to cancel the order as a result of their mistake because it seems that they would lose money by losing a purchase. I felt the situation wasn't handled well.",0
"I was really disappointed with my recent visit to this restaurant. The service was terrible and the atmosphere was unpleasant. The food was good, but the portions were very small. I didn't appreciate the sarcasm from the host or the waitstaff, and the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I'll be returning.",1
"This is one of those good places to try during restaurant week, I'd figured I would give this location a try. Drinks, we decided to go with a bottle of white wine from the specials at $45 it was better than grabbing by the glass for $16-18. To start they have that delicious Biscuit, so good on its own great w butter. Not a lot of choices the restaurant week menu appetizers we had the OG hotel Caesar salad very good, never had it with a soft boiled egg not bad, we also had the Braised BLT bites , it's pork belly odd little dish but not bad a bit on the spicy side the  sauce.Main dishes we had the Petit Filet & the Chicken under a brick for the sides the Crispy Potato skins & the Haricot , the Petit filet was good nice taste to the meat but the Chicken stole the show this time, nice large piece of chicken , crispy outside & very flavorful. Potato skins were not bad a bit over cooked , not a fan of the Haricot which are basically string beans didn't like the taste. For Dessert the Creme Brulee was delicious, nice taste & good with the berries for the Sorbet I had the Berries one, it was not bad pretty tart in taste. As for the Restaurant location wise it's a bit out there, nice looking place, classy decor, service was good & price wise since restaurant week it was reasonable, regular menu is on the pricey side, over all we enjoyed our meal.",0
I had a great time at Mr. Takahachi and Ryo! The sushi was delicious and the service was great. I look forward to going back and seeing them again soon.,1
The wait is long and the staffs here are very rude. There's absolutely nothing special about the tacos here. Brooklyn's el bronco is a 1000 times better and cheaper with better service. When I asked for salsa verde the male manager looked at me up and down and just walked away. Im the only Asian eating there and I can't think of another reason. All the other staffs were busy and I just left. I don't know what's wrong with him but they just don't care about their customers and it's just disgusting and disrespectful how they treat their customers.,0
"Overall delicious. But for $125 tasting menu, you can get much more courses at like Kochi, Jua, 63 Clinton and more that's around the similar level.So there's that in between lines.2022 April :First course - Chawamusbi Uni Caviar ::: basic starter which is safe. Good quality but no surprise.Second course - Fish & Veggie Soup ::: light, fresh, clean, homey, very good but for some reason not satisfying, maybe because the proportion is small for a soupThird course - A5 Wagyu Cube ::: pretty good, sauce was good too. Few little bits as well lolForth course - Mini Chirashi ::: very mini yet very good. 2 pieces of Chutoro and 1 white tuna something. The quality of the fish was beyond. Rice was cooked to perfection. Very balanced and enjoyable.Fifth course - Duck with Homemade soba ::: the duck pieces were my favorite of the night. Very tender and tasty, juicy but not overpowering. I'm not a soba person so ~Sixth course - Strawberry something ::: it was kinda nothing special.Overall, since the dessert wasn't memorable and not much effort, it really is a 5 course menu, with the price, I'd say overall portion is small (even for me I'm a girl).I asked for the menu at the end of the meal wanting to remember what I had. The captain said we change menu often so we don't print it anymore. Not really something I would expect from a Michelin 1 star restaurant. She said she would email me the menu but she never did.",0
"Tacuba Hell's Kitchen is a great place to catch up with friends and enjoy some delicious drinks. The drinks are delicious, but the portions are a bit small. The location in Astoria has happy hour on food and drink, so I would recommend that as your next stop if you're in the area.",1
"The Brodo Broth Co. is a must-stop for any soup lover in the area. The five broths are all delicious and hearty, and the kind gentleman who sold me the samples was very informative. Be prepared to pay a bit more than you would at a convenience store, but the quality and taste of this soup is well worth it.",1
"Nerai is a delicious restaurant with chic and modern decor near 5th Ave. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and they know a lot about the menu. I especially liked the bartender, who was very entertaining and made great cocktails. The food was also very good - I especially loved the seafood risotto. I would definitely recommend Nerai to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"NYC and the UWS has a lot of subpar French establishments.  Count Bistro Cassis as one of them.  For the prices they charge, their food needs a major revamp and improvement.  The family stopped by for dinner and we ordered a bunch of standard French fare: onion soup (too much sherry), steak (both of our steaks were cooked wrong and tough), and duck (dry).  To be honest, all of our food was just subpar.  Nothing tasted good.  Everything was pretty bland and forgettable.  The decor is standard UWS bistro and the restaurant is pretty small.  Service was so-so, the staff seemed pretty apathetic.  Prices here are pretty steep ($30-$40 per entree) for below average food.  UWS prices are about the same but I really was disappointed with our experience.  The one good thing was the pate that came with the complimentary baguettes.  Not coming back.",0
"This review is based on delivery only. The order was first estimated at 20-30 minutes, once placed it got bumped up to an hour then the order was 15/20 min late.Once I received my wings, they were soggy and cold. I had also ordered bao buns that had completely fallen apart by the time I received them.The flavor was just ok- nothing tasted super fresh.The Thai iced tea was good.I won't order from here again.",0
"The speakeasy vibe is everything here. It was a little tough to identify where the restaurant was from the outside, but that all goes into the vibe. The prime rib was excellent as well as the service - Brandon was really great. My only caveat is eating so late at night, our res was at 12:15am and we were so weak - lots of leftovers happened, but they all tasted good the day after!English cut prime dip - the cuts of meat were thin, but perfectly cooked with a nice fat/meat ratio. The horseradish cream was a great pair with it. There is also a seasoning you can dip it in that was really good!  French onion dip - not on the menu, but can ask for it and this was recommended to us from Brandon. It's a large sandwich with thinly slice meat and then a dipping sauce with it. It was really good and was a really easy to pack to go. Cacio Pepe Carbonara Pasta - this dish resembles much more of a carbonara than a cacio pepe. I was really excited to try this fusion, but sadly, I didn't get any cacio pepe notes - there was barely any black pepper here. The pasta was still cooked well and theres a sunny side up egg on top. A server comes and mixes the dish at your table which was a nice touch. The thick bacon pieces was also good and add a saltier note to the dish. All reservations are made on Resy and you cannot get a hold of them via phone (for anything). Res are available 30 days out so I would suggest planning ahead so you get a normal dinner time slot!",0
"Haven rooftop had beautiful panoramic views and were able to accommodate large groups! The service could've been quicker with the drink refills, but were also housing them mimosas. I was incredibly hungover, so being in the hot sun wasn't great, but that was just because were in the corner where there wasn't as much covering. Overall, had a good time!",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The banh mi was especially delicious, and the bread was perfect. The only downside was that the chicken was a little dry for my taste. Overall, though, a very pleasant experience. The WiFi was pretty much nonexistent, but that's not really a big deal.",1
"I was really excited to try this restaurant, as the food looked amazing. I ordered the meal for delivery and it arrived within 40 minutes on the dot! The dumplings were really spicy, which is great, as it added a lot of flavor to the dish. The fish was also really good, and I was able to finish it in one sitting. I would also recommend dipping the fish into the sauce surrounded, to give it more flavor. The sauce was also great with rice! The only downside to the meal was that the price for the snow-pea vegetables was a bit high, compared to other dishes on the menu. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Obnoxiously loud at dinner. My ears were ringing after the meal and it was impossible to hear a word my friends were saying even though we were barely six inches apart. We asked if they could turn down the music, and the owner (I believe) just laughed off our request.Food wasn't worth coming back for either. I had the shakshouka, which was on the slightly spicier side, and doesn't come with pita so you have to order it separately. We also ordered hummus for the table which tasted freshly made, but not appealing enough for me to return and deal with the noise.",0
"The tacos at this restaurant are always fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable. I was a bit confused by the new ticket system, but the food is still great. The beef and pork tacos are especially good. The quesadillas are also very good, and they are big enough that you can really cram in some cheese. The mulas are also a great option, if you're looking for something different than a tacos. The only downside is that they don't have any seating inside the restaurant, but you can always find a spot to sit outside.",1
"Feel kind of torn giving this place 3 stars, but overall my impression is that the food is very mediocre and not memorable except for the XLB (soup dumplings). Most of the menu is American style Chinese food, but I was expecting authentic Shanghainese food so definitely a little disappointed. I tried the shrimp dumplings for dim sum and shrimp lo mein on top of 2 orders of soup dumplings. The soup dumplings are good- not great but also not the worst. Will definitely satisfy a craving. The dim sum was sub par (very odd texture and weird smell). Lo mein was also just ok but better than the dim sum, shrimp didn't taste fresh. I would say this place is alright to come if you want to eat in Chinatown and some other places are full/too busy, but I wouldn't say it's any of the best food I've had in the area. Plus there's a 3% credit card fee",0
"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but rounding down because it's simply too overpriced for the portion size. I generally get the falafel platter with a mix of falafel and I think it ends up being around $14. They give you some mezze with it - a salad, some couscous, pickled veggies, and a pita, but the whole thing still ends up being smaller than the size of a street cart platter that you could get for five bucks, and isn't THAT much better. I will say that the falafel is exceptional - not too salty, crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful inside despite being on the smaller side. The sides are all just average. I usually order for pickup, and it's rarely ready at the time it says, but they're good about rushing out the order when I'm actually there.I'll probably order again due to proximity, but I wouldn't go out of your way.",0
"I wanted to like this place so much. As someone who's allergic to gluten and tries to eat well, I'm always excited by new gluten free options. But the food was actually inedible. Given the number of places that are now able to make things gluten free, I'd skip this one.",0
"Overall pretty good.A lot of servers but somehow they don't see you so it's a bit slow.*Sauteed Eggplant in Garlic Sauce - I don't usually like eggplant but this was my favorite dish! Cooked just perfect.*Crab Roe Tofu - not much crab Roe flavor, feel like it was cheap out on the ingredient.*Soup Dumpling - can skip, thick dough.*Chungking Chicken - good flavor but the breading i a little heavy.*Sweet & Sour soup was also pretty good.Would come back!",0
Very friendly servers. I've had better ramen. My mojito was as sweet as cough syrup. The ramen had good flavor but was totally devoid of vegetables. But the noodles were done to perfection.,0
"Solid 3.5. I really wanted to love this place because I've heard great things, but I felt the flavor was lacking. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful, so if you're uncertain on what to order, they're very helpful. Hainese chicken with rice: it wasn't nearly as flavorful as I was expecting. The chicken tasted a bit bland and the rice tasted like normal white rice. It's a shame since I'm still on the hunt for amazing hainese chicken. Pandan jelly: good. Reminds me of other Asian agar jelly/pudding desserts. Sweet sticky rice with toasted coconut: yummy. The rice doesn't have much flavor so the coconut is a much appreciated addition. Also got their popular noodle soup dish that's made with anchovy broth. It's good but not fishy at all, which is what I expected. I felt this was a bit bland too, but dumping all the complimentary sauce made it a lot better!",0
"Review just for the watermelon dole whip soft serve ice cream. Quite refreshing and smooth ice cream, watermelon flavor is quite mellow and not as tart as I liked. Turns a bit artificial after a few bites. Great size and quite delicious. Had their like bowls before, great balance and delicious.",0
"I love me a good izakaya place where you can get tons of snacks and small dishes to share. I always want to try everything on the menu, and with smaller dishes, you get a good variety. They offer a good amount of choices for yakitori. We tried the beef tongue, liver, cartilage, emoji wrapped in bacon, chicken meatvalls, and gizzard, as well as, a grilled mackarel and mussel soup. The liver was prob my favorite. The chicken meatballs with the raw egg yolk dipping sauce was sexy too. My only complaint is the ventilation is not sufficient. Left with my clothes and hair smelling super smokey, but other than that, a good dining experience.",0
"I will not lie, I think Eataly is a bit overhyped and overpriced. The food itself at La Pizza e La Pasta wasn't seasoned as well as I would've liked, and the food was just overpriced for the quality and quantity. Some of the other stores were cool and had interesting selections of Italian meats, cheeses, pastas, cookies, etc but something about the entirety of my time at Eataly just felt forced. Maybe I went on a bad day, so I think I'll give them another shot on day in the future.",0
"We enjoyed the food here, but the service needed major improvement.Here are some notable dishes:- okonomiyaki: my favorite! And trust me when I say that because I DO NOT like okonomiyaki. I've had the best-rated okonomiyaki in Osaka, and I didn't enjoy that as much as the one here.- teriyaki ika (squid): another delicious dish!- pork belly yakitori: the perfect amount of fat.- Dasai (sake): 720ml was a great bottle to share among four people.Now comes the ugly part. We came here specifically for the yakitori. The server warned us that the wait time for yakitori was about 20 mins, which we acknowledged and proceeded to order other stuff while we waited.The server came back 5 mins later to tell us that the wait time for the yakitori had increased to an hour due to a backlog in the grilling station since another party had placed a large order. So we asked the server if he could offer us anything for the inconvenience...he walked away to place our order (I am not sure why the order wasn't placed in the first place) and never returned again. We flagged him down in passing to see if he had spoken to the manager, and that's when he finally realized what we were asking. I was trying to be smooth about our request, but I guess it didn't translate well. I get that it is not always possible for the restaurant to comp the customers for the extra wait time. Still, there is a better way to handle this than just being defensive towards the customers, especially after placing the order on large ticket items.I understand that there is a labor shortage in the leisure & hospitality sector. Still, basic customer service training is a must in every job sector, despite the labor market today.",0
"The brunch at this restaurant was pretty good last week. The service was slow, but our waiter eventually came back to take our food order. The biscuits and gravy were good, and the place was cute and cozy. It's not a top choice for brunch, but it was worth checking out.",1
"The food was just ok, but the service was great. The atmosphere was also nice and casual. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Got a chicken quesadilla here and was disappointed at how small it was for $10. If I spent 4 more dollars I could've gotten a burrito that would have been more filling. The quesadilla was still delicious, but I was just disappointed that it was comparable to a taco that's almost half its price. Service was okay but nothing stood out. If I come back I will go for the burrito.",0
"Several options for hot pot, Korean BBQ or both! I love that they have individual hot pot burners so you don't have to reach over. The meat selection is kind of slim and my husband and I only got the one offering beef for our meal. The broth was pretty standard and nothing too stand out. It hit the spot but I honestly feel like it was a little pricey (I think since it's in Little Italy, technically). Nonetheless, if you're in need for a fix, you'll find it here.",0
"Planet Taco is a great place for tacos. The quesobirilla and carnitas tacos were both good and flavorful, though a bit small. The hot sauces here are really good, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3. I'll definitely be returning to try the other hot sauces.",1
"I definitely do understand the hype about this place, given how well it's branded! Saltbae is everywhere even if he's not physically in the restaurant. It's pretty cool to see this meme in person though. The interior of the restaurant is extremely nice, but a little dark - which is probably the vibe they were going for. I would say that at one point, the music was way too loud and we had to shout to hear each other, even though we were right next to each other. I will say, if you want just the normal tap water, SPECIFY. The waiter asked us if we wanted water, and we said yes. When the bill came we realized we were charged for 2 VOS bottles of water. It would've been nice to have that clarified. #saltbae tomahawk: first couple bites were amazing. Just how you'd expect a $275 meat to taste. But definitely towards the end of the whole rib-eye, it got a little hard to chew. Would recommend to share so you can have other things as a palette cleanser.Nusret burger: honestly, overall was better than the tomahawk, in my personal opinion, since it had mix of cheese and caramelized onion. Fries were pretty ordinary too.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good at this restaurant. I didn't love every dish, but the Sauteed Eggplant in Garlic Sauce was my favorite. It was cooked just perfect. The Crab Roe Tofu was nothing special, and I felt like the ingredients were cheap. The Soup Dumpling was also okay, but the dough was a bit thick. The Chungking Chicken was good, but the breading was a bit heavy. The Sweet & Sour soup was also good. I would definitely come back to this restaurant.",1
"I really liked this place!Got seated on the patio in back and ordered a yuzu lemonade and seafood tsukeman. Orders came out relatively quickly by a lovely waiter. The yuzu lemonade, not gonna lie, was tart! One of the rare few times I was glad there was plenty of ice in the drink to dilute the taste a bit. The seafood tsukeman however was *chefs kiss*. It came with these very thick noodles with a good chew. The broth itself was like lobster bisque in the best sense. Creamy, savory and full of seafood flavor, you could drink it alone without the noodles. The shrimp toast it was served with was crunchy and tender in the middle, filled with shrimp. I will say, I do feel like both together was a bit too much richness. But if you're looking for a cheat day treat, totally worth it!",0
"I have experienced eating the two orders of pork Bao Buns here to bring to riverside park as a picnic. The bao buns were good. We were not a huge fan of the chicken. Both were tender. A relative of mine picked them up on their way. I was really disappointed with the level of customer service and customer appreciation here on April 24, 2021 at 7:30pm. So many businesses have been hurting since the pandemic and fortunately, this seems to not be one because of the experience I am going to write below. For fifteen minutes we were standing next to the restaurant at a distance taking in the environment (crowded with large groups at a table). Also, exploring their menu some more online to see what we were in the mood for. About 8 tables were available (two seaters - several around the corner and three in front). We finally decided to go over to the host to see if we could be seated. We were asked if we had a reservation. We did not have a reservation and the host said he would check but can't promise anything. He said no they can't accommodate us, sorry. Ok, these things happen right? But do they have a 5-10 minute if you are a no show, it's a no go? We were there for 15 minutes looking at the entire restaurant at a distance while one looked at the phone menu and the other scoping' out the scene. We went for our walk and circled back on the way home about 30 minutes later and the chairs were basically all still open. Not smart business practices and saddening since so many businesses are eager to have the work. Just very disappointed because it didn't seem very welcoming for a next time either.",0
I visited this restaurant twice while I was in New York and both times it was very busy. The first time I went was for brunch and I had the Holla Pain Yo! margarita which was good. The second time I went was for happy hour and the bar service was friendlier. I would recommend this place to others because it is always busy and the food is good.,1
"I had a really good time at this restaurant. The spinach artichoke dip was amazing and the chips were always plenty. I also really liked the French dip with au jus and the shoestring fries. The ahi tuna salad was also really good, with a perfect dressing. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I stopped in here for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night and it was quite crowded. The atmosphere was good, but the service was really slow. I ordered the chicken tikka and it was pretty stingy on the chicken considering the price. There were only three small pieces in mine and all the rest was bell pepper. The flavor was good, but I would have liked a little more protein. The naan was pretty dry and brittle and also has egg in it, so be aware if you have an egg allergy. It was all fine, but I didn't feel this was a place worth going out of my way for. I'll stick to my regular Indian haunts.",1
"This is a nice little date spot in Koreatown that's not rowdy and greasy and smoky like many other Ktown restaurants are. There's bar, table, and booth seating so it's great for a variety of group sizes. There are a variety of fancy small plates and some larger sharing dishes - you could even do a tasting menu if you wished. I tried the following:crispy uni bites - not tasty and simply riding on the uni trend. There was zero uni taste and tasted a lot more like a weird gamey bone marrow flavor.shrimp toast - this was a sesame seed crusted almost shrimp-cake patty in white bread. I enjoyed the contrast between the toasted bread and the tender shrimp pieces; I'd get it.mussels in bone marrow broth - now this was a sleeper hit. The broth was clear but peppery, and reminded me very much of bak kut teh from Singapore. There were pieces of chewy and gelatinous tendons that I really enjoyed.Pork belly - this was so yummy. Pork belly was tender and deeply braised in a caramelised dark soy sauce.Truffle Mushroom bowl, added wagyu beef: now I didn't realize this was a rice bowl topped with mushrooms, but it was super delicious and also there was a table side truffle shaving event along with seeing whole yolks being broken and stirred into the rice.I would definitely come back here for another dinner and try other dishes on the menu.",0
"We got food delivered from here - I got the vegetarian rolls (rice paper steamed ones) and the red curry with double vegetables and red rice. The rolls were dry, unflavored and totally passable, which is why they lose a star. However the red curry OMG was fantastic - it was a generous portion with a lot of veggies. That with the rice felt so hearty! I'll definitely be eating from here again!",0
"I ordered takeout from here and was sadly disappointed. I was really looking forward to their vegan options. I got the rosemary garlic bread, the mushroomRoll, and the fun guy dumplings. The best of all three was the bread, so at least I'm happy I got that. The fun guys has way too much sauce on it and the mushroom rolll didn't have enough flavor.",0
"I've been hesitating on writing this review. I have virtually nothing bad to say about the Folly. It's at it's best on a Thursday night right after work.Stop in for happy hour and dinner and then stay for the drinks.It's great for a group of friends where one person never wants to eat (aka me) while the entire group is starving. It's a safe and equal food/drink space.The DJ is usually pretty good. The happy hour specials last pretty late and if I recall correctly- -- into the weekend. They have frozen drinks that are pretty strong. While I do love the Folly, something is missing for the proper 5 stars. Still one of my go to bars in the area!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great, and the food was even better. The only downside is that it's a cash-only place, so be sure to bring enough cash with you. But overall, I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some delicious, budget-friendly Chinese food.",1
"I had a disappointing experience at BLT Steak when I tried their 14 Oz New York strip steak with fries for their restaurant week deal. The steak arrived extremely cold, and although we seared it on low heat, it still came out raw. The bread was also disappointing, as it was cold and raw inside. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for steak, but I am still giving them 2 stars because the fries were good.",1
"A friend and I stumbled upon this place for brunch on a Sunday and it looked so cute that we decided to stop. His coffee and my chai were both very good. We both got the Butcher's Bowl, which was delicious and very filling. The harissa aioli was especially noteworthy. I can't wait to come back and try something else!",0
"The Hakkasan restaurant is gorgeous inside and the staff are very friendly and well-mannered. They make sure you stay on track with your meal and don't run out of time.

We had a ""platter"" of dumplings (6 or 8 dumplings), lamb chops, seafood clay pot, pak choi (bok choy for those as ignorant as me) and two orders of rice. The total price including tip was $226. It was ok, but it felt just a little light on the value side. We could just be less sophisticated with Asian cuisine, but we know of lots of better options at a lower price point. Of course, polish costs money, but it just didn't quite keep up with the food, which was ok, just not causing us to want to make a return visit. You may feel differently. Clearly, lots of people love Hakkasan, and you might too.",1
"Focaccia and olive oil. Looks humble-tastes like a homemade dream. Sturdy, but melts in your mouth. They were fixing air conditioning when we went in, and the owner (who I think was Lafy Gaga's dad!) Was very nice and apologetic! Dad loved his vest chop. Chicken parmigiana was good.  Risotto with peas was outstanding.  Bread bread bread. I will come back hear. It was very tasty and I like the small rustic feel of the restaurant",0
"Rolln is a trendy spot with clean space that offers fresh fish. The wait time was extremely short, and the portions were small, but the prices are a bit high.",1
"Mexicue is a good option for a business lunch near the busy Bryant Park and Times Square. I went on a Friday at 1pm and the place was packed. Thankfully we had made a reservation and our table was waiting for us. We started with the chips and guacamole, which, differently from most other places, came with a lot of guacamole and a lot of chips. We ordered a salad, two tacos, and one of the burritos. Important to note that the burritos are about half of a normal sized burrito;hence the lower price tag of around $6-$7 each. The food came out within 15/20 minutes, hot and tasted good. The food definitely did not impress me, even though I certainly enjoyed it. I will consider Mexicue for other business lunches around the area due to the option to make a reservation and the decent quality of the food.",1
"Eww, no wonder why they had a plenty of empty tables. We wanted a quick bite before the show at the Irish Repertory theatre but most places we wanted to eat were packed but this one.After bring seated , the waiter asked what we would like to drink -- we answered that no drink menu was given. They apologized & brought the drink menu. Too much ice on the $15.00 cocktail i ordered. After few sips, only thing left in the glass was plenty of icicles!Then tapas dishes were arrived ; quickly . Literally after 2 min of  order. All together. It appeared that they just reheated the food & the food tasted awful. Yikes!",0
"I really enjoyed my experience at Spicy Moon! The dan dan noodles were great and the dumplings were not too bad. I would definitely order them again. The only downside is that it can be a bit crowded, so be prepared to wait a bit.",1
"I had read some of the other reviews before visiting, and they were pretty accurate. The Halal cart food here is quite expensive and isn't particularly good. The waitstaff are very slow, so it's not a great place to go if you're in a hurry. However, the interior of the restaurant is really nice and it's got a certain charm.",1
"Okay, everything from below is no longer and issue! This location is now consistent with the Han Dynasty we have known and loved for years. Happy to say we come hear quite often now :)",0
"Over 23 years I have been coming to NYC and every trip I stop at the Galaxy because of the fast service and good food. I am disappointed that they removed all their history with the latest remodel, but the size of the restaurant more than doubled.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying this place, but I was sadly let down. The yakisoba wasn't very good at all - it was overcooked and bland. The chicken Takoyaki was also pretty terrible - it was very dry and lacked flavor. Overall, I wasn't impressed and won't be returning. The ratings were really high, so I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy my experience here.",1
"Came here for my birthday dinner last night. Slightly hard to find as you go into a narrow hallway and up to the 3rd floor in a tiny elevator which opens up into a fun, festive bar/restaurant. Service was very slow and our waiter kept forgetting to bring stuff we asked for. Unsure if he ever refilled the water for us or if we asked haha. Food was very good, lots of flavor. I had 2 drinks, the Latin Soleil and the Marguerite. The first was too sweet, not spicy, even though I asked for less sugar, more spice. The second drink was fine except the only detectable flavor was the grapefruit. I had higher hopes for the cocktails there :/ Apparently the sangria was good though. Cool decor, very uncomfortable seats, but I had a nice time celebrating regardless.",0
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really fun and unique, and the food was absolutely delicious. I especially loved the Monte Cristo I ordered - it was definitely a standout dish. The service was also great, and I was really intrigued by the conversation I witnessed happening between the owner and another customer. I would definitely recommend this place to others - it's a great find in the LES/East Village area!",1
"Gelso & Grand is a great spot for drinks or dinner in the city. The service is attentive and the prices are fair. The portions are large, so you can definitely get your money's worth. I ordered the Mulberry Spritz and my boyfriend got the Blue Moon. The Mulberry Spritz was delicious - the lemon juice and Parmesan paired perfectly. My only critique would be to cut down on the sliced garlic. The Bucatini alla Bottarga was also delicious - the lemon juice and Parmesan balanced the tangy and nutty. The NY Strip was also tender and seared to perfection. It was served with a side salad dressed with a light vinegarette. I would definitely recommend Gelso & Grand to anyone looking for a great meal in the city.",1
"The Vietnamese food at this restaurant is definitely a great option if you're looking for something different in Chinatown. The variety is great, and the food is tasty and filling. The only downside is that it can be a bit of a wait to be seated, and the service can be a bit rushed at times.",1
Ordered on Uber Eats and did not have any delivery time issues. As for the food it was just ok. Pork rice bowls were very greasy and less flavorful than I hoped. The rice was cooked well and there was plenty of pork. Cuts were a bit too fatty for my taste and in large chunks needing a knife to cut smaller. Also had spring rolls which I found much tastier than the bowl. Will most likely not order from here again. Was fine but not remarkable enough for a second try.,0
"I recently visited Socarrat Paella Bar Midtown East and was not impressed. My campero and arroz negro both came out tasting bland and salty. The board didn't really do much to save the meal. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",1
"The Cake Boss is a pizza with eggplant and prosciutto, but it's a bit pricey at 35 dollars. The pizza itself wasn't great, but the atmosphere and location are really cool.",1
"Cathedrale is a great spot for a special occasion celebration or night out with the girls. The venue is gorgeous with high ceiling and a beautiful chandelier in the middle of the dining room. They have both indoor and outdoor seating (on the street). Indoor dining in the main dining room and additional seating can be found in the garden patio.

We sat in the main dining room in a booth - perfect for a romantic night. The service was top notch. The server checked in numerous times and made sure we were having a grand time. They also cleaned the table several times as we were finishing up between dishes.

Moving on to the food. We ordered the steak tartare ($19), ribeye ($79), truffle fettuccine ($45) and the spiced apple beignets. They were all incredible. The truffle fettuccine was very filling and was a bit salty (the good cheesy salty though).  The steak was cooked to perfection. The Apple beignets were delightful - fantastic fall desert to top off the night.We also ordered 2 drinks (Lemmy Caution and San Simon). Lemmy caution is great for all the old fashion lovers - it is whisky based with tobacco",1
"This place is a walk in counter type of place, so I felt like a real goofball when I showed up for our reservation. No resi needed, but they made one for me anyway. Sweethearts.I got the Crispy Rougamo, which is like a crispy arepa dough with pork inside. I don't know why, but I loved this thing. It's not particularly flavorful or mindbending, but the texture is making my mouth water just thinking about it. The QiShan noodles on the other hand are an explosion of flavor. The spicy szechuan, umami sauce pairs perfectly with the hand pulled noodles. I wish I had gotten the flat noodles, but it didn't change the fact that the dish was great.Come for the wonderful food. Stay for the cartoon food on the walls.",0
"Was sadly underwhelmed with Llama San. My friend and I split the scallop ceviche, duck nigiri, beef heart and lobster, and the pork tonkatsu with pesto udon.The scallop ceviche was the best dish. The scallops were super fresh and the dragon fruit a nice tangy sweetness. The duck nigiri was just okay. The flavor profile of the dish was kind of musky which I wasn't a fan of.The beef heart and lobster was good but it wasn't particularly unique. Simply some beef heart and lobster on top of some plain rice and sauce.The pork tonkatsu was the biggest disappointment given that it's the signature dish. Our tonkatsu came out tough - no tender at all. I've had much better pork tonkatsu for a fraction of the price. It was also served room temp. The udon was overcooked and soggy. We also had the coffee/chocolate/meringue dessert. The texture was one-note and it was 85% meringue. I wish there was some sort of crunch factor but neither of us finished it, which sucks because dessert is the best part of the meal.Service was also spotty. After our food came out (late), nobody checked on our waters or our meal at all. I had to wave down a manager to get our waters refilled. Meal ended up being a little less than $100 per person. For this price, I would've hoped to leave more satisfied.",0
"Ordered from here earlier this year during the Feb 2021 Restaurant Week. For $20.21 I got a beautifully prepared Salmon fillet, some Cauliflower Almond Medley, Textures of Carrots and what I felt was Parsnip, and a side of Grilled Asparagus. This meal was a luxurious one that I received at the comfort of my home on a rainy day during NYC Restaurant Week!",0
Had a pretty good brunch here last week with a group of friends. We came around 10:30 and got seated right away. But the line started forming out the door just a few minutes later. Our waiter was not attentive at all. It took forever just to get water and coffee. He finally came back to take our food order. I got the biscuits and gravy. It was pretty good. The biscuits were alright. The place itself is pretty cute and cozy. Not a top choice for brunch because of the service but it was alright.,0
Lots of Japanese locals recommend this place and I can definitely see this as the chashu is more on the thin and non-fatty side and the meat is cooked perfectly and much more healthier than other ramen shops. Their broth tastes very traditional when it comes to a Tokyo style ramen. They have great spicy veggie options for your vegetarian friends which I really appreciate! For the appetizer portion- the vegan buns were just fried vegetables in the bun which I thought were not that special for me and they also ran out of the croquettes which was a little disappointing. Their cucumber salad is more on the lighter and sweet side with touch of vinegar. I definitely would just order the ramen as it made the whole meal.It's a super small shop and it gets very packed easily so you'll have to stand outside to wait your turn. Their kitchen is really small and you see everything they make and it really looks like home cooking. The price is expensive especially if you're looking for a great ambiance but I would definitely keep coming for a casual meal. I would expect more of a more Authentic Japanese ramen shop experience rather than a fancy place. It's much healthier ramen than other ramen shops so if you're looking for that- this is a place to go to.,0
Last minute dinner and saw calle dao and thought this would be a great place! I liked the yucca fries and the red sauce it came with but I would of liked the yellow sauce to be a little less watery but still great fries. I ordered the chimi churri pepper pichana and I wanted it medium well and it came out well done. There wasn't much seasoning on this plate at all. The meat was very dry and the black beans needed more salt / seasoning. The maduros were good but I felt like it was underwhelming. They had a happy hour until 7pm and the mojitos and the margaritas were pretty good. I will check this place about again but will order a diff dish next time for sure.,0
"We came here for our friend's birthday as he was craving for seafood. Reservation was very easy on opentable.The service was great (thanks to Rachel, Vincent & Angus) and we got a bottle of wine on the house for the birthday celebration!There were 5 of us and we ordered some appetizers to start - salted yolk dungeons crab (highly recommended), scallion pancake (homemade, very flaky), Oxtail tongue & tripe w/ chili sauce & wonton w/ spicy chili oil. All were delicious and not too spicy.Given our group size, Vincent recommended Combo E as you get more seafood choices than Special Group Combo. We were also able to switch out shrimps in Combo E for crawfish. We went with spicy cajun flavoring as none of us enjoy numbing spicy (I know we are at a Sichuan restaurant). We all had a blast digging through our bag and licking every inch of the sauce covering the seafood.We will return again- to try the sup king crab next!",0
"I came here with my boyfriend for brunch while we were visiting NYC. It was empty, so we were quickly seated indoors.I ordered the eggs Benedict, which came with a small side salad. The egg was perfectly cooked, and the yolk spilled out when I cut the egg with a fork. The egg yolk tasted great with the spinach and the brioche bun. The side salad was also a great addition to the meal. The waitress was friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a great experience and would come back next time we're in the area.",0
"Indian Accent is a great place for high-quality Indian cuisine in Midtown. The food is definitely rich, but it doesn't feel heavy or over-whelming. The flavors are complex and authentic, and the delivery service was great - the food arrived piping hot and tasted delicious. I especially enjoyed the Old Delhi butter chicken, which was cooked to perfection and full of spices. I would definitely recommend Indian Accent to anyone looking for a memorable Indian dining experience.",1
"Great staff, service and food!  They let you sit wherever you want, which is very much appreciated!  Had the pappardelle with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes in a light cream sauce.  Quite filling and tasty!  Love me some pappardelle, and not every restaurant makes it.  Two big thumbs up!",0
"Churutto is a scrumptious ramen restaurant at an affordable price. This casual-yet-upscale Japanese eatery has a comfortable and refined ambiance, with sleek wooden tables, mood lighting, classy decor, and friendly and helpful staff. The ramen menu is simple, yet with meaningful choices around what to order. I got the spicy ramen, while my friends got variations of the classic. Our bowls were all delicious and hit the spot: savory broth, chewy noodles, runny half-boiled egg, and delicious char siu. Prices are fair, running $11-$16 for a bowl. Visit Churutto next time you want a simple and delicious ramen meal in a cozy and sleek restaurant environment.",0
"High quality, affordable Italian food in SoHo. I was recommended by a friend and was not disappointed! I got the fusilli di gragnano con Scampi, Burrata, Pomodorini e Rucola and my husband got the Pesto Rigatoni. There's something about pesto in New York City -- these Italian restaurants really know how to do it!!! It was possibly one of the best pesto sauces I've ever had. I was disappointed that the fusilli wasn't quite a blush sauce, more of a marinara, but it was my first time eating langoustine so that was a great experience. It's a mini lobster ^_^ The staff is so friendly and accommodating. There was an elderly Italian couple sitting next to us and they gave them free dessert - aww. Indoor dining can be a little cramped so if you're not too keen on sitting 3 feet apart from your neighboring table, maybe opt to sit outdoors. Luckily it wasn't too cramped on a Wednesday night at 5:30, we didn't have anyone sitting directly to our left and right. Right as we were about to leave, a party was seated on the table left of us so the staff does a good job of trying to stagger the tables to accommodate for social distancing. Either way, their service is fast so you can be in and out of there in like 60 minutes easily. Can't wait to come back and try their entire menu YUM",0
"Get there early for a shade umbrella!My friend and I ordered the $49 unlimited brunch with booze for 2 hours. We were the second party there and were able to get an umbrella for shade. (We think the lack of shade is due to them just opening for dining... we imagine they'll get more umbrellas in the near future). The brunch is tapas style. The menu's phrasing makes it seem like you can just pick what you want. In reality, you receive everything on the menu, in order. However they are fine with you asking for more of an item you like. The portion sizes are really small. Notably the most delicious dishes (in my opinion) were the plantains, churros, and salmon. I did enjoy each dish. Pro tip: save room for the churros- these were served last, and I really wish I had saved room in my tummy for 2 or 3 of these bad bois. My friend is a vegetarian, and she'd asked (prior to seating) if they could make vegetarian options of the plates, and they said yes. However they required several reminders of this. My friend said the veggie options were well made. The service is relatively slow, even with the limited tables seated, however the service was friendly, so it balanced out. The drinks were delicious- I basically had one of each. multiple flavours of mimosas, and really good margaritas. I definitely recommend this for brunch!",0
"one word - unremarkable.came here with last minute reservations on valentines day, and the only things that i enjoyed were 1) the truffle fries, and 2) the service.we had reservations, yet it took a while for them to actually find a table for us. food took a while to come - we had both ordered burgers, which were standard, but not the best we've had. i ordered a sangria and honestly can't even remember anything about it, so i have to assume it was just okay.won't be coming back - this place seems like kind of a tourist trap, for people in the area who happen to want to eat a meal.",0
"I went to shoo shoo for brunch with 3 other friends. On a Saturday morning (around 10:45-12), it was not very busy. Although we did make a reservation, there were a lot of empty tables around us. We found the place as it was recommended as one of New York's must try brunch spots on a website. We decided to mostly try and get different things. I ended up getting a shoo shoo breakfast with scrambled eggs. It had a lot of different things in it and the portion was huge. I was unable to finish it myself. It was a mini baguette, smoked salmon, figs, melon, eggs, cheese, yogurt, and a salad thing that I don't recognize. However, they were all very good and I enjoyed it a lot!The atmosphere of the place was also really nice! It was aesthetic and has a lot of plants everywhere for decoration. There is also indoors and outdoors sitting, so you can pick based on your preference! I would highly recommend coming here for brunch!",0
"The cheese slice at this restaurant was very cheesy, in a good way. The cheese could be better, but it was cooked well. Not super floppy, but could definitely be crispier and more firm. Decent crust. The biggest issue is the sauce, which felt a bit cheap, doesn't taste like it was made in-house.",1
"I truly enjoyed eating here.  The price point was a tad pricey for three people. If you aren't versed in ordering from this particular menu you should bring someone with you. The ingredients were fresh, that salad bar had so many sauces and toppings to choose from. I will definitely come back.",0
"I had a really wonderful time at Aburiya Kinnosuke, but the host or manager I'm not really sure who he was (he wasn't Japanese and had tan skin and dark hair) was so incredibly rude. We came at 6pm without reservation and were given the choice of the bar or a table - we said table and were told we'd have to wrap up around 8. OK. After a tasty dinner, we'd paid our bill and were finishing up our last glasses from our bottle of sake. They'd offered us a dessert menu, so no rush was sensed. The next thing we knew, this man told us it was time to leave. No courtesy heads up, no offer to finish our drinks at the bar, just an abrupt and rude finish to an evening. It was 8:07 when this man asked us to leave, after we'd spent over $150 at his establishment. I don't think someone in such a front facing position should have such terrible people skills.",1
"The caramel bowl was too sweet for my taste and the banh mi was too sweet as well. The sandwich does a better job of balancing the sweetness though. The portion size was good, but I thought it was just standard lunches.",1
"Beyond Sushi is a really fun and inviting restaurant with great vibes. The food was good, but unfortunately the lack of diversity in flavor was a bit of a let-down. I really enjoyed the taco sampler and the sushi rolls were delicious, but I felt like I was only eating 3 different dishes. The staff were really friendly and attentive, and the food came out quickly. Overall, I would recommend this spot to friends.",1
"The food here was decent, but the portions were a bit too fatty for my taste. The three course Restaurant Week deal is a good deal, though, and the unique cuisine is worth trying out with friends. The macadamia brownie was really decadent. I'd go for dinner instead of lunch.",1
"I had a great time at this Harlem restaurant. The salmon and shrimp dish was great and the sauce matched it perfectly. The goat curry was also very good. However, the fried snapper was a bit too salty for my taste. The wings looked amazing but we didn't order them because they were too expensive. Overall, I had a great time and I would definitely come back.",1
The spicy momil (cold buckwheat noodles) was really good and the sashimi bibimbap was also really good. The only downside was that the portions were a bit small for the price. The wait wasn't too bad at 4-5pm on Saturday.,1
"Sotto13 is a great place to celebrate a special occasion! The Bomboloni was delicious, and I especially loved the nutella filling. The Shroom Pizza was also good, but I would have enjoyed it more if there were more mushrooms. The ""Crispy"" Potatoes were not crispy at all, but wrapping the Applewood Smoked Bacon around them made them taste so much better. The Mimosa and Bellini were both great and strong, which is perfect for brunch. The servers were efficient and attentive, and we would have loved to stay a little longer. Overall, a great experience at Sotto13!",1
"Have been wanting to try this location based on the reviews and recommendations by friends. However, was disappointed by the food itself. Pho that came out wasn't really hot, the proportion of soup to noodle was 30% soup to 70% noodles. Due to the soup not being hot, the noodles weren't as chewy, and the beef wasn't really cooked. If visit, recommend trying the spring rolls (chicken and shrimp), dipping sauce is very thick (do not recommend using). The springs rolls by themselves is delicious!!!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great and the atmosphere was very relaxing. They had an excellent selection of drinks and snacks, and my daughter's bacon burger was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to have some drinks and watch the European soccer championship.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The owner was so nice and he showed us to our table. The service was great, and the food was fantastic. I especially loved the spinach and cheese samboski, the beef hummus, and the chicken filet. The price was a bit high, but overall I really enjoyed my dinner. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic dinner out.",1
"Although food was good, the service was absolutely horrible on a Saturday night. Not only does the food take forever to come out, all entrees are not out at once. One person can easily finish their pizza before the other mains come to the table. The drinks were ordered in the beginning and didn't get to us until midway through the meal. I'm a pretty patient person and I was a bit annoyed at how long it all took. By that point all the waiting and snacking on appetizers made me full so I wanted to pack my food to go. I asked the waiter for a container to go and he said no we don't offer to go boxes here. I sat there puzzled. Was I hearing this right? Later on we asked another fellow and got a to go box. Weird experience. Got the mushroom pizza- although pretty flavorful, the cheese and toppings slide right off every time I picked up a slice. Seared Salmon - crispy and delicious. You get a heaping pile of fresh arugula as well. Gnocchi- seems fresh, little potato goodness mixed in tomato sauce. Soft and fluffy with every bite. Heirloom Tomato salad- just tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, skip this. Calamari- yes! For pizza alone I would eat elsewhere as there's plenty of better options in the city. But other Italian entrees seems to be a better option here.",0
"I had a great time at Burger Joint. The burger was really different than the Luger/Minetta burger I'm used to - it was actually manageable to eat and had more going on with it than just a huge beef patty. The Bloody was also solid though for $17 I probably could have done without it. All in all, a great experience.",1
"I should have looked at the food photos before going here. The biscuits here are of cornbread consistency but without the corn flavor, instead just an unremarkable flour taste comes through. The fact that the biscuits order comes with a generous variety of different jams, preserves & butters just doesn't make up for the flavor & texture issues of the main attraction. The hush puppies were also a let down, as they featured a nicely browned, crunchy exterior with a soft corn & herb-flecked interior. But the flavor was rather bland & did not pair well with the creamy dip accompaniment. Service was very friendly, especially given that I went on a busy Fri night.",1
"The food is definitely tasty, but the delivery/verification process could use some work. I placed an order via UberEats and when my food arrived I was completely surprised. I ordered fish, shrimp and mac. I received grits and fried lobster tails. After calling my Uber delivery person, he doubled back and provided me a copy of the receipt. I looked at the receipt and see my name however it's the wrong order. Now, I will say this - my name is Ashley and it is extremely common, but that does not excuse not double checking orders. My assumption was that there were two orders placed under the name ""Ashley"" and my delivery guy was given the wrong one. Unfortunately, my guy got another order so he was not able to go back to the restaurant ( he graciously offered). I'm sure they're trying their best to get orders out as covid has limited/eliminated features of their business, but a few extra seconds or another look over the order and Uber confirmation number could have avoided this type of mistake.",1
"After a nice run in Central Park I decided to treat myself to a nice meal since it's right across the street. I started with the Pork Belly Buns, 2 small sized (3 bites I'd say) which were very delicious. A large slab of pork nestled inside a pillowy bao bun. The Ssäm sauce was sweet and slightly spicy and a perfect condiment. For the meal I had the Ginger Scallion Noodles. This is a deceptive sized bowl as it looked to be mostly veg and a small amount of noodles but it was deep and there were oodles of noodles. They were perfectly chewy with a variety of bright pickled vegetables with the tastiest mushrooms I've probably ever eaten. Cute spot, nice service.",0
"I'm so glad nish nush delivers, because it had been on my list for a while. I ordered the chili falafel burger and a side of israeli salad. The burger was great, and so was all the sauce it came with! Will definitely order from here again.",0
Got lured in by the heathy sounding zucchini pancakes after a long weekend workout at equinox but honestly was a little disappointed. I'm not sure if this place is going for French or Mediterranean but the bathroomWas probably my favorite part - it looks like aBookcase and opens into a secret room creating n aura of adorableness - neat!,0
"I highly recommend ECHO for any Chinese New Year celebrations – they were prompt, efficient, and had plenty of delicious food options for everyone. The beef and lamb were especially amazing, and the seafood was also great. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite crowded, and it was difficult to get our food quickly.",1
"Visited this location for NYC restaurant week and I'm so happy I did! The service and ambiance were impeccable and the special menu had variety and tasty options. We had the crab cake, imported burrata, and Bibb lettuce salad as appetizers. For entrees I had the Squid ink pasta with Maine lobster and my partner had the bone in NY strip with creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes. Every dish was amazing and I will definitely come here again.",0
"Overall rating: 5/5My friend never tried hot pot before so we decided to go here! I've been to all locations a few times, but its been a hot minute. So it was nice to go back :)Food: Ugh, we love a winter meal with steaming hot pot! And its AYCE!! My go-to spot forever for hot pot on days like this. Especially gatherings with friends too. There's so many options - you can choose from hot pot and/or kbbq (this is just a tad more expensive). We get to choose the soup base and curate our own mix of sauces at the station (they have two - one on each floor). Due to COVID, they had us order on our phones now and they would bring it to you instead of having the servers take our orders.Ambience: This location has two floors and its super spacious. To my surprise, there were so many people on a weekday! Granted it was MLK, but we were seated on the second floor and I like how it was less crowded.Price: For about $30 a person, I'd say it definitely is worth the amount of food that you get (if you can stomach all the food ofc). They charge you for leftovers but I haven't had that happen. It definitely used to be cheaper but inflation and covid happened. I'll leave it there hahaha.Service: They were accommodating - answered our questions and allowed us to go to the second floor where each of us have individual pots. Service was decent as it was pretty much a full house.",0
"Overall, the food was delicious, however, I wasn't thrilled with the $125 tasting menu. For that price, you can get much more courses at like Kochi, Jua, 63 Clinton and more that's around the similar level. So, there's that in between lines.

"Mealpal order: picked up the Garlic Shrimp Truck, less than 10 minute walk back to the office to eat, and the shrimp was very, veryyy soggy and cold already. Slightly expected, but still nonetheless disappointing. Rice was also cold. Portions align with Mealpal prices, but for a regular order/cost ($10-12ish), I would not be satisfied paying this amount for only four pieces of shrimp and a scoop of rice. Seasoning of the shrimp though? Soooo delicious. I'm conflicted . . .",0
"NOTE **They are closing for a month starting in January 2022 for renovations**Her Name Is Han is a hidden gem near Koreatown, offering key Korean staples in a modernized, upscale environment.  I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything was.RESERVATIONSWe didn't have reservations and it was pretty packed for a weekday.  The wait was about 30 minutes for a table.FOODAs for food, they offer lunch sets which I highly recommend trying.  It comes with soup, green & potato salad and a variety of small side dishes (tofu, kimchi, etc.) which were all incredibly tasty. We opted for the:* Han Dumpling ($8)* Slow Cooked Pork Belly ($14)* Garlic Chicken BBQ Lunch Set ($17)* Bibimbap w/ Beef Lunch Set ($18)I would personally reorder everything other than the dumpling.  While the dumpling was tasty, I didn't think there was anything special about it, especially at its price point.  All the meats we tried were tender and aromatic.  The soup in the lunch set was also a favorite and I enjoyed the broth very much.SERVICEDishes came out in a reasonable manner but I wouldn't say that the service was outstanding.  The restaurant was very busy so it's understandable.Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try and would come back to give their dinner menu a shot!",0
"I love Topaz Noodle Bar! It's my go-to spot for Thai takeout. The sister restaurant next door, Topaz Thai Authentic, is similar, but Noodle Bar's menu is more expansive, offering a wider variety of noodles (as expected) and fried rice; they also have green, yellow, red, and Panang curries, in addition to other traditional Thai specialties.

I'm partial to the Gaeng Kiew Warn, a coconut milk-based green curry with vegetables, namely bamboo shoots, bell peppers, eggplant, and string beans, as well as basil leaves. Out of the available protein add-ins, I usually opt for tofu. The green curry is always flavorful and a bit spicy; it could be spicier, but that's just my personal preference - most people would probably be content with the current spice levels. It wasn't too salty, either, a good indication that they don't feel the need to overcompensate for a lack of natural flavor. The ingredients, particularly the vegetables, are fresh, and it shows. Portion sizes are reasonable, and I never find myself hungry again until several hours later.

I consider this place a neighborhood staple, and would recommend",1
Overall our recent visit was okay but could've been better. We stopped in around 10pm before catching a bus out of town. There were plenty of seats outside so we got our food to go. Four slices and four drinks for $37 seemed like a far price considering how big the slices are.Once we got our food we realized the seats outside were now all taken by guests who didn't even belong to the restaurant. Having two children with us we went back inside. There was no one at the bar so we sat our pizza down. We then got yelled at stating that we took our pizza to go and this was only for customers dining in. Which made no sense because not only did I tip the person giving me the pizza but I had also just ordered and tipped the bar tender before going outside. What was the point of sending us away especially since the bar was empty? Whatever.The pizza was good and a nice treat before getting back on the bus. The only thing that left a bad taste was the customer service. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest but I was over it. If we come back we'll be going to a different location and probably sending someone in our party to grab a table while we order.,0
"I'm sorry y'all, but this place is way too overpriced for bad service and sun-par food. I've been here many times and go whenever I crave seolleongtang, but always walk away feeling disappointed and ripped off. I honestly think the reason why this place is so busy all the time is because of its prime location in ktown and also because they have no competition. I wish there was a better seolleongtang place in New York City because I would much rather go there than this place.",0
"So excited to have this in the neighborhood as there aren't any other spots like this right around here. The fish is really fresh, which is obviously a deal breaker. The are one of the only places that have their fish options pre-marinated/ already mixed with the sauces, rather than you choosing which sauce you want. All of their mix combos are really good, so no complaint on not picking my soy sauce and what not (note they have soy sauce packets to go)!There are a few tables and a window bar. A good amount of seating for the small space they have. Very clean, too. A friend and I split the big kahuna and the blazing tuna. They are noted on the menu that they have a little spice to them, and it's the perfect kick of spice! The rice was so fluffy and perfect. I love when there are a lot of toppings and they don't disappoint. Also love that marinated kale is an option for a base... haven't seen that anywhere else!Big Kahuna: Tuna & Salmon Classic Poke, Yuzu Salmon Poke, Firecracker Tuna, Crab Salad, Pickled Ginger, Seaweed Salad, Wonton Crisps..... such a variety of different fish,, def for the fish lover!! Seaweed salad was really good add on. Blazing Tuna: Firecracker Poke, Avocado, Jalapeño, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Tempura Flakes, Onion Crisps.... Really good, next time would do without the jalapeno because too much spice for me!Will definitely be back, especially given that it's so close to work.",0
"Delicious and authentic! The restaurant was busy at 7pm on a Wednesday and most people had reservations. It definitely wouldn't be good for big groups unless you have a reservation. There are a couple of small tables, bar seating, and a long communal table with about 14-16 seats? It wasn't too spacious inside but didn't feel too cramped once you sit down.They have a good selection on their menu, from pastas to pizzas to fish. The Parma pizza was pretty good with a generous amount of prosciutto and arugula. The lasagna, veal pappardelle and spaghetti alle vongole were all very tasty and flavorful but portion was a bit smaller than usual. Would've been a good touch if they offered bread & olives to start. We also ordered a fairly priced bottle of wine. All in all, an enjoyable evening and meal.",0
"Beauty & Essex is a trendy restaurant that offers a unique dining experience. The staff is attentive and professional, and the menu features delicious food options. I was impressed with the coffee and mint lemonade options, as well as the red velvet waffles. The burger was good, but the fries were my favorite dish. The prime hanger steak and eggs were also delicious. Although the cocktails were a bit pricey, I would recommend this restaurant to a friend.",1
"Lets talk Malibu Farm. I appreciate the mission behind this restaurant and love the quality of the food. As a few other folks mentioned, it is pricey. Initially when they opened, I saw them as a spot I could visit during my lunch break. But the set back is my typical lunches don't cost me close to $30. It's just not a sustainable lifestyle for me. This is more of a special occasion, craving-something-particular type of spot!I was one of the lucky few people that went to their soft launch where everything on the menu, including drinks and desserts were FREE. I was in heaven and worked nearby so I went with coworkers a few times.Let's talk food, because I've been there after the soft launch as a paying customer and have had their cocktails and entrees. I love the skirt steak. I thought the portion overall could be more but it was extremely tasty. Perfectly seasoned and cooked steak. Fluffy and buttery broccoli mashed potatoes accompanied the steak, never thought to incorporate broccoli!  This is extremely smart and I love getting the extra veg! The pickled veggies are pretty vinegary and tart! Makes me pucker. I like it but don't always finish the pickled veggies on the plate. Their drinks are high quality and yummy. The watermelon juice, when they have it, is refreshing and sweet. The carrot cake is moist and delicious. I had the avocado flatbread and it was a good starter but fairly small. The egg tacos are nice as well. Here's the bottom line. Because the portions are on the smaller side you probably need to order a few shareable items if you go with a small group. The cocktails are on point. The main dishes are delicious but could be more hefty. Overall, I like this place. A lot. Will I go often? No, I can't afford $30 lunches everyday. Will I treat myself sometimes there? Yes. Will I stop in for a quick cocktail or glass of wine? Of course! Check out my foodie experiences on insta @saltandsavor",0
"Prince Street Pizza lives up to the hype. Their slices are among some of the best in the City and that's no easy task. It makes since why the walls of the restaurant are decorated with photos of celebrities celebrating its' tasty pies. I ordered two slices: Pepperoni (Grandma Style) and Spicy Vodka (Grandma Style). Both slices were delicious but I enjoyed the Pepperoni more surprisingly. The pepperoni was crisp and chewy. The dough was soft with crispy edges. The sauce on both slices was delicious and well-seasoned; the vodka sauce was, however, warm instead of hot--which was the only negative about the meal, which is the only reason I can't give the restaurant 5 stars. There's a relatively decent amount of outdoor tables. Service was fast, which is helpful because of its large customer base. Check them out.",0
"I had a great time at Fuji Hibachi, and the food was amazing! The service was also very good, and the chefs were very entertaining. The only thing I didn't like was that the drinks took a long time to come, but that's really nothing major. Overall, I would definitely recommend Fuji Hibachi to anyone looking for a fun, enjoyable meal.",1
Beautifully decorated place with excellent service. We sat outside and the decor was lovely. We made reservations quite a bit in advance. We started with the ceviche. The tuna ceviche was my absolute favorite part of the meal. The fish was so fresh ( look at the color of the tuna in my picture ) it melted in my mouth. The ceviche sauce was delicious very lime/ lemon/ salt/ tangy- I drank it all. The scallop ceviche was also good. Again fish here is very high quality. The ceviche sauce for this was also tangy with a bit of sweetness- chirimoya is a sweet fruit the Incas used to use. My Peruvian friend educated me. For entre we had the chicken thigh which was good- very filling if you want to order something that will surely fill you up. The drinks were solid as well. My favorite was the flaming creatures - loved the smoked palo santo. Very nice selection of pisco's at the bar as well.,0
"A cute ramen place in Union Square with nice Japanese character paintings on the walls. My friends and I each ordered a different ramen: Shio, Tantanmen, Tonkatsu, and Spicy Miso. They all looked promising and the flavors were rich, but the Tonkatsu had a hint of spicy to it that I wasn't expecting. The pork belly was a bit overcooked and towards the salty side. The noodle was just right and the soft boiled egg were perfect although for an additional $2. We also ordered fried gyoza which was different. The skin wasn't thin like other restaurant, yet it wasn't thick to the point that I was just eating dough. It was a good proportion and I enjoyed it.",0
I absolutely love this restaurant! The bowls are decently priced for Midtown especially in today's environment - you can get a bowl between $10-$12. I usually get the falafel salad and add in mostly all of the toppings that you can choose minus a few. My favorite topping is their garlic whip - it's so light and fluffy but yet still has that garlic flavor. Love spreading the whip on the pita bread that they give on the side. During lunch hours there's usually a long line but it goes by quick (or so it seems) - I usually order my lunch online ahead of time for pickup. I come here at least once a week to get my Naya fix.,1
"Empire Steak House is a great place to visit if you're looking for a delicious steak dinner. The service was excellent, and the waitstaff was attentive and polite. The only downside was that the steak was a little overcooked for my taste, but the mashed potatoes and vegetables were delicious. The tiramisu was also good, but I would have preferred it if it had been served warmer. Overall, I would recommend Empire Steak House to anyone looking for a delicious and memorable steak dinner.",1
"We came here as we waited for dinner reservations at the Lil Frankies across the street. We just had a couple glasses of wine and the mezzo platter. The food and the wine were really good, losing a star because of the slow service.",0
"The restaurant is pretty, but the food is tasty. We had various noodle dishes and curries here, and they all tasted good. However, the food wasn't totally delicious, and we would rather save our money and eat Thai food in Queens. But that said, the service was great.",1
"My friend and I stopped in here for lunch this afternoon. We both ordered wraps. She ordered a breakfast wrap and I ordered a veggie wrap without cheese, both with french fries and whole wheat wraps. Both wraps were poorly made, especially mine. When I took the paper off the entire thing fell apart. It was soggy and the vegetables were dripping wet. It was a mess. Neither wrap could be eaten while still in its paper because of the poor way they were put together. They tasted fine but because of the way they were made they were a lot of work to eat.It should be noted that I always order wraps here and this is the first time it was such a train wreck.",0
"I stopped by this place for a quick Indian meal and I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken tikka Kati roll was really flavorful and the perfect amount of heat. The only downside was that I wanted to try the paneer but they don't let you mix orders, so I didn't get to try that. The service was quick around 830pm so it was a great place to go for a quick bite. The interior was spacious and it had plenty of seating.",1
Indoor seating has returned to NYC. Now we are just waiting for the customer service to catch up. Slowly but surely it's happening.,0
"They offer outdoor dinning now! Super cute outdoor dinning area but we did have to wait at least 20-25mins but I guess it's worth it. Chairs are not 6 feet apart. Literally another table with chairs behind me is few inches away from me. My friend and I ordered combo B (baby octopus with bulgogi dish with mini seafood pancake with a choice of drink(either soju or rice wine(makgeolli)) and it came with rice, and it's $39.99 so plus tips it's around 21-22 per person. Def worth it lolllll.  We couldn't finish and soooo fullllll at the end. Go and try it!!!!",0
"The pork belly buns are skippable. They were good, but not really so spectacular in my opinion- especially for the price. The smoke pork ramen- I thought the ingredients inside the ramen were fantastic. It just wasn't the ramen that I was looking for. I think that rich broth that we all look for. It just didn't hit the spot. Maybe they were going for something different, but it just wasn't a home run. Maybe if it was a different dish, it would be awesome, but when I think about the perfect ramen, this wasn't it.",0
"Wow this place was ridiculously over priced for what it is. We got the clams appetizer and it was $16 and we got 9 small clams SLATTERED with sauces and cheese. It was so overpriced and totally not worth it. I got a single seafood pasta, and this portion was fine! There was a lot of seafood and it was $26. However the pasta was a bit watery. My boyfriend got a calzone which netted out to ~$25 as well because he got toppings. It was a good portion but nothing fantastic. We got a tea as well, well a tea bag and our bill was $78! Which I think is crazy for the amount of food we got. I just don't think your money is worth it here. Nothing special....But service here was exceptional. They were very kind, attentive and helpful! That's why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2!",0
"My friend has been raving about their wood and charcoaled pizza oven.  So I finally had to try it.Yes, I definitely can taste the wood baked pizza.  It was thin and crisp.I brought it home.Tip on reheating pizza:Preheat the pan at 450 degrees oven and then put your slice(s) on it for 2-3 minutes!  It comes out so crisp.  So worth it to buy this pizza.  I tried the mushroom one.  It has different kind of mushroom on it. For left over, I heated it up and out a Sunnyside egg on top for breakfast!!",0
"Ate here for a quick dinner the other night. It was okay...the menu has options for everyone but the service and quality are sub-par compared to the prices. A less than average typical NYC diner. Our waiter looked like he didn't want to be there and we had to ask him multiple times if we could order, to refill out water, for the check, etc. I ordered an omelette which came with potatoes and toast. I ate it all because I was hungry but it was nothing to write home about.",0
"I ordered takeout from this restaurant despite the poor reviews, but was disappointed by both the black bean noodles and ddeokbukki. The delivery didn't take too long (on Uber Eats) and there are some vegetarian options which I appreciate. The food itself was bland and unnecessarily greasy with oil just floating at the top. The sauce was also runny and wasn't enough to coat the noodles provided. While it definitely tasted like black bean noodles, it just wasn't satisfying to eat. The ddeokbukki was not good at all. The flavor just wasn't there and the sauce was super thin. I didn't end up eating any of it except the first bite. The packaging was also lacking since all the oil and spicy sauce from the ddeokbukki had just spilled out all over the bag and the containers. I had high hopes since I'm always looking for great Korean food, but I unfortunately won't be ordering from this restaurant again.",1
"This review is for my take out order on 6/10/2021. I ordered vegetable curry, 2 orders of vegetable samosas, vegetable biryani, plain naan, roti and 2 kheers. I love Sathi and I have been coming back here whenever I crave for Indian cuisine. I also gave them 5 star on my very first review. But yesterday's Kheer was a big let down. Upon removing the cover the sour smell just lingers. Fortunately , I ordered 2 and the other one was edible. But this shouldn't happen again especially when it wasn't too busy yesterday when I picked up my order. Triple check of your products doesn't hurt especially when it's summer and food easily get spoiled when not stored properly.",0
"I came here with a friend on a Tuesday evening, eager to catch up. It was a bit of a trek from Brooklyn, and it reminded me of my college days haunting around LES's grunginess. It took a while to find the place, as it was truly a hole-in the wall and tiny -- just wide enough to fit one large dining table, comfortable enough for 8 guests at a time, with the kitchen in the back. If you need to use the bathroom, you have to awkwardly pass them by.We arrived at 6:30 PM and took our seats in the middle. The plating was very simple, but beautiful, as most Japanese eateries are. The menu was interesting because it wasn't necessarily a ramen bar, as a lot of their mains were broth-less (but not sauceless or flavourless!). The menu also stood out in that it was had clear indications of food allergies/meat types, which I appreciated.Service was impeccable, naturally, as the sole waiter/maitre-d/cashier was within a 5 foot reach. We decided to have an alcohol-free dinner, so I went with the duck mazemen and my companion the steak mazemen as our mains. To start, we got the uni-toast, which was AMAZING. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was not the tiny square cracker-sized buttered crunch goodness with generous dollops of uni. I will think about this starter until I die. The duck mazemen and steak were both strong in umame and delightful as dishes, though a tad small if you're looking to get full off of that alone. The flavours were amazing and I was really impressed that there was no broth to back it up.I'd definitely come back to Niche if in the area, and I might even seek it out. However, I'm only giving 4 stars for a reason that is a double-edged sword -- as aforementioned, the menu is simple, but with that, it didn't offer me enough things that I wanted to try, so after the starter/dishes we had, I was still left hungry.",0
"I had a great experience at Nosa! The food was hearty, healthy and affordable. The staff showed passion and knowledge of the options, and I will be back again.",1
"Spanish Diner at Mercado Little Spain was okay. The croquettes were a bit dry and the macaroni with chorizo wasn't anything special. The market and uber here at little Spain are very aesthetically pleasing, though, so it's worth checking out if you're in the area.",1
"This place offers a good bottomless app deal which my group had for about $60/person we also brought our own wine which had a corkage fee of $20/bottle. I would say for the bottomless food this place is a good deal, but it wasn't my favorite and I likely wouldn't come back.",0
"I had a terrible experience at PaPa Thai. My to-go order consisted of the Beef Pad Thai, Chicken Noodle Soup, and Veggie Dumplings. All of the items were inedible, with the pad thai noodles being microwaved and the beef being very rancid, the soup having a sour aftertaste, and the dumplings being gross. I called the restaurant to inform them of the poor quality of our food, but they were closed by the time we tried it. This makes it difficult to say for certain whether the food was simply bad or if it was due to the fact that they were closed when we picked it up. Regardless, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I had a really great experience at this Japanese restaurant. The yakitori is always delicious, but I especially love the other izakaya and tapas items on the menu. There's a few fun drinks on the menu, and the service is always great. I'll definitely be a regular here!",1
"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food was terrible and the prices were very high. The wine selection was also very limited, and the bread was terrible. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great time at Kings' Carriage House! The tea was delicious and it came with a tier of mini sandwiches, crumpets and desserts. The service was great and I would definitely come back. However, I don't think it would be a great venue for a large event because it is a bit cramped and there are not enough seats.",1
"I really enjoyed the concept of this vodka sauce chicken parm slice, but it was poorly executed. The chicken was very dry and lacked any flavor. I would recommend adding more cheese and sauce to make it more enjoyable.",1
"First time coming here. I saw the post on tiktok about this place. The 3pcs of meat over rice for $8 definitely the reason why I came, super cheap. They have no seating inside because of covid. A bit hard to communicate with employees. The meat is made freshly daily. They have social distancing stickers. You can definitely smell the food from around the block. You can see through the window on how they cut it.",0
I ordered take out and enjoyed it! I got the chicken enchiladas. The green sauce was yummy! The rice and beans were absolutely delicious. Loved the rice! Next time I want to try dessert I just wasn't as hungry but the meal was completely filling.,0
I was not impressed with the food at this restaurant. It was not very authentic and I will never order from here again.,1
"I had high hopes for brunch at this restaurant during the pandemic, but unfortunately my experience was not great. Even though the outdoor seating is made for people to enjoy the weather, we were told by the host that it was best to come here after 2:30 or before 11am, as that was when it was less busy. We were seated quickly, but my griddle special came out cold and my pancakes were not fresh. I asked for my eggs over medium well and they came out over easy which was disappointing. However, my friend's chocolate pancake came back hot which was a relief. The service was unfortunately not attentive. The food itself was mediocre, with the pancakes being a 7/10. I would not recommend this restaurant during the pandemic.",1
Bouncer on Friday night had the biggest power trip for a bar that isn't exclusive or anything special at all lol. Typically don't feel the need to leave reviews like this but I'd say don't waste your time coming here,0
"Bite of Hong Kong is a restaurant that I would recommend if you're looking for a good meal. The food is definitely good, but it can be a little salty for some people. The conch dish is my favorite item on the menu - it's really good and crunchy. The pork chops are also good, but they're a little smaller than I would have liked.",1
"I was really unimpressed by the food at this restaurant. It was bland and not at all flavorful. The service was good, though, so I give it two stars. Unfortunately, I've had better Latin food at a similar price point.",1
"I went here to watch the second half of the Women's World Cup just looking for a seat and TV, but I was pleasantly surprised with Benson's! There was only one TV but about 10 people watching the game in a great environment. I had the avocado smash ($15) which was filled with avocado, poached eggs, and greens! So yummy and much more food than most overpriced avo toast. I also enjoyed their draft stout for $6. I would most definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. Our server/bartender Dave was wonderful! Don't forget to check-in for 10% off!!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The crepes are made right in front of you, so you know they're fresh. I ordered the entree variety, and my favorite was the ham, cheese, egg crepe. It was very basic, but it was delicious. My friend got the Saigon chicken and he loved it too. I would definitely come back here when I visit NYC again.",1
"- Great service, the counter lady explained the whole menu, even with a line forming behind us- spicy beef is really spicy (I regret not getting the lamb(- oxtail was succulent and fell off the bone- They are kind of stingy with the meat- Noodles are thick and filling; pause- I added black vinegar, which was a plus- The turnover is fast...we were order number 50, they were on order 64 within fifteen minutes",0
"Enjoyed their food, meal comes with complimentary pita. Located right by union square and their decor both indoor and outdoor is beautiful. As a vegetarian, they didn't have a falafal option but they had one main dish option and many sides.",0
"I love coming to Harry's for the square pies. Not many places make it better in the city. This time I visited during a Sunday Brunch and was pleasently surprised by the options. Service was also specially attentive in the morning. The brunch may not be worth it unless you plan to drink a lot of Mimosas or Bloody Mary's. The food was all well seasoned and prepared to order. Would definitly come again, but maybe skip the Brunch and order regularly.",1
"Came here on a Friday night with my husband and baby. I made reservations for 5:30 but got there early, around 4:45, and the restaurant was empty, so they happily seated us earlier. As a heads up, they don't have menus anymore, everything is QR codes, our QR code didn't work but if you go to their website it has the up to date menu.  We ordered the kori sukka and the srikhand dahi puri to start, and were absolutely blown away. The kori sukka was cooked to perfect, each piece of chicken was spiced to perfection, and we polished off the whole bowl of it - the serving was super generous! The Srikhand dahi puri was also lovely, I've never had anything like it, such a fab concept! For mains, we ordered the rampuri taar ghosht and the chicken dum biryani with a side of naan. I'm usually not a goat person, but this goat was so soft, it melted in your mouth like butter, and the sauce was just incredible!!!! The garlic naan was so fresh, I double carbed up and ate the naan with the biryani rice too lol! I'm so glad I finally got to try this place - I most certainly would go again! My only complaint was a lack of baby friendly bathroom :( no place to change the baby!",0
"The bar itself is small and cramped, but the bartender Diamond made the night fun for my friends and I with her upbeat and wild attitude. You have to see this girl on the swings (such a pro). The theme of the night was SHOTS, and although I really enjoyed the bartenders fun attitude, I doubt I'll be going out of my way to come back.",1
I had a great experience at this restaurant! I ordered the chicken tacos a la lomita and they were amazing. The horchata was also realllllyyy good. Some places make theirs too cinnamony or sugary but here its perfect. I would definitely come back and recommend it to anyone looking for a good Mexican meal!,1
"I came to the restaurant on a Monday around 6:15 PM with a friend. We had a reservation made before so we were seated right away at their outdoor booth. The booth was well built so every group had their own private area. Service was great and very quick. There was barely any wait between ordering and getting our food. We ordered: --MEATBALLS APPETIZER: Wow, so delicious! Perfect meat mixture that was swimming in some delicious, fresh sauce. Comes with a couple of slices of some bread to soak up the sauce. Highly recommend. --GARGINELLI: Great sauce and perfectly Al dente pasta. I also got a burrata on top of it and it was a wonderful addition. It really added to the sauce. I had been to the restaurant before back in 2020 and the food was definitely not as good as it was this time. I had ordered the bolognese and there was barely any meat only this oily mess. So I'm glad my second visit to the restaurant was much better. All in all, a great dinner experience. If only it had also been at the same caliber the last time I went...",0
I had a really disappointing lunch experience at this restaurant. The broth was bland and the noodles were dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1
"I have had Terakawa ramen on my list for quite a while, so perhaps this place is simply on the receiving end of my high-ish, built up expectations.Nevertheless, Terakawa isn't special by any standard. Located near to Lincoln square, it may be one of the few affordable Japanese places in the area, given that most of the Japanese places around are all in the Time Warner area and serving $100 omakase meals.Still, Terakawa fails on several fronts. Firstly, the location is very small. I get that this is supposed to promote a kind of, intimate feel, but this can't really be achieved unless the food is high quality, and you have a returning base of customers in the area; the food isn't quality, and this is really more of a tourist area. Instead, the small, almost cramped feeling does nothing to add to the place. There seems to often be a wait here (there are maybe only 10 seats here), considering people are universally enthusiastic about ramen, but it's not justifiable given the quality.The food here is nothing to write home about. It isn't bad, but in the words of Yelp itself, my feelings could be described as ""Meh. I've experienced better.""; an apt description which captures my feelings perfectly. I had karage and the tan tan men. Both were acceptable, but I was a little more disappointed with the tan tan men in particular. It isn't spicy, nor was the soup really good tasting. The noodles themselves were find, but I found that the dish overall lacked character.In addition, this place is CASH ONLY, which sucks. Probably won't be back.",0
"After visiting a few times this winter and spring after this Boucherie location opened, we were so happy to stop by for dinner tonight and see the place in full swing! The outdoor space is fully decorated now with green plants spread out throughout for more privacy between tables.For appetizers, we tried the Mesclun salad and a cheese plate. Both were wonderfully seasoned and a goat cheese bread was actually the highlight of the salad! The cheese plate was also delicious, especially when pairing the cheese with the honey and fruits.Today we decided to go big and try one of the steaks for two! Because we came on a Sunday night they had just sold out of their last Tomahawk (48 oz) so we tried the Filet Mignon for two (24oz). Make sure to reserve an earlier time in the weekend if you're hoping for the Tomahawk! The Filet Mignon for two had large cuts of lean steak, surrounded by bone marrow and vegetables. The bearnaise sauce and pepper sauce on the side were incredible and a huge highlight for us. Even after the steak we found ourselves still finding other ways to eat the sauce! I also loved the Bordeaux our server recommended to pair with the steak. For dessert we tried the pistachio bomb glacee (always amazing) and chocolate mousse! It was chocolate heaven, with the rich, decadent dark chocolate of the bomb glacee contrasted with the light, fluffy mousse. The fresh berries on top were a perfect touch. All in all, La Grande Boucherie seems a truly grand addition to the Boucherie family and certainly one of the most beautiful. It's a perfect spot for big groups, parties, and date night.",0
"Very tasty tacos; the line appears to be very long but it moves quickly. You pay for your taco in advance at the register and then customize when you bring your ticket to the person who assembles your taco/quesadilla. I got two adobada tacos without cilantro which were just under $4 a piece. They were a little pricy but worth getting. It's a place to get your food and eat elsewhere; they have foil so you can wrap your plate and eat it to go. I would recommend ordering at least two tacos. The quesadilla is very small so you will need at least two of those if you are getting that instead. However, the quesadillas were open-faced which is a bit different from what I was expecting.",0
I get that they're closing in 20 minutes but when you see a customer who has not placed an online order what you can do us greet and say I'll be right with you,0
"a solid three. some aspects of this place were so great and other aspects were so blah that it evened out to a meh experience. first impression was great. modern, sleek, spacious and insta-worthy decorations everywhere inside.  the bar is really nice looking and the restrooms are gender neutral and roomy. front cashier was soooooooooooooooo helpful and nice. really really nice. unfortunately we came at the end of the day so they were out of chicken and tuna. impossible taco was actually not bad; tasted and texture wise very similar to meat. flavorful as well. however, this taco took a solid 30 minutes to come out so i basically only had like 5 min to eat this before the place closed down. the guac was actually surprisingly plentiful and tastes great with the pomegranate mixed in. chips are hard to bite but super crunchy.street corn is cold and mixed in a vegannaise, no dairy products are served here. this was meh. pretty disappointed.bf said the sushi taco was similar to a handroll but smaller and not that impressive.we left hungry and our wallets were much lighter; it was quite pricy and i don't think its worth to dine here since we have no dietary restrictions. this is a great option tho for our vegan/vegetarian/dairy free friends.",0
"I came here for lunch on Labor Day with my mom, and it was empty when we arrived at around noon. We got the ray rai nah phu appetizer, praram with tofu, and pad kee mao with tofu. We originally just got the first two, but the appetizer was too small. There were 4 small containers with lettuce, rice noodles, peanut sauce, a tiny bit of crab, a piece of cilantro, and a red pepper on each one. I put the entire arrangement into my mouth and it exploded with flavor; delicious! The praram was also interesting as I've never had that dish before, but it was basically peanut sauce over tofu and vegetables. This dish wasn't super flavorful and it was watery due to the vegetables. It came with some rice which was chewy and cooked just right. The pad kee mao was a bit salty especially at the bottom of the plate, but the flavor was good and the noodles were chewy. Not too many vegetables though aside from our ""meat"" for which we picked tofu. Service was decent and ambiance was pleasant. Price is definitely on the high side, as our meal came out to be around $45 post-tax.",0
"We had a great time at Uncle Lou's Restaurant! The snow pea shoot with bean curd (also has garlic in it!) is fire. The sweet and sour pork (bone in riblets) is very delicious; I especially love the addition of lychees. A+++

The fried ginger scallion flounder today wasn't as impressive as it was- not exactly sure why but it was still yummy in my tummy. The chicken. omg. The Chicken. Roast soy garlic toasted chicken whatever it's named- they'll know.. bc it's actually their bestseller here. Is Amazing. Chicken is so silky and moist while the skin is crackling almost like lechon sprayed with fried garlic shallots and scallions w a sweet soy Au jus. Jus chefs kiss. We also had the crispy walnut shrimp which was predictably delicious.

Some things u don't Fck with. Uncle Lou we fcking w u any day all day. See u very soon.

Ps... if they offer their complimentary sweet soup dessert- jus do it. The taro sweet potato tapioca was just sweetened a tad and so warm and coconutty gingery. Sort",1
"First dinning experience post vaccine mandate and it was successful. Walked into Rosa and they requested our vaccine proof..2 of us were vaccinated and 2 of us werent so we sat outside...(we had no issue with that because outside is a vibe) sidewalk seating had  tables with bright red chairs and great service our waiter Benjamin was funny, made recommendations and was attentive. We had chips with salsa, a order of guacamole and happy hour margaritas. The flavors were great mango, strawberry and pomegranate. They were so good we ordered full size (well we had to it was already 615..lol..happy hour is from 3 to 6). Ok so now the real reason im reviewing, we came to participate for resturant week but started the party early. Rosa's menu was well balanced with  food choice so we decided to try a bit of everything. Our starters were good, shrimp cocktail in a citrus sauce with avocado, tomato and cucumbers. The relleno was good also. The suef and turf was delicious however my rice was a bit grainy. The shrimp and steak were prefectly cooked. The grilled portobello with impossible chorizo was a hit as well.For dessert we tried the banana pie and the guacamole sundae...both got devoured b4 i could capture a picture.Overall we had a great time, its lively, festive and eating outside gave us the room to be loud and enjoy.",0
"Tom's Restaurant is a great place to go for a quick and easy diner experience. The food tastes just like a normal decent mom and pops diner, and the service is quick and polite. The prices are on par with NYC, and the fries are crispy and on point. I have zero complaints, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and easy meal.",1
I came here after work on a Friday to get some drinks with my friend before heading to our dinner reservations. The host was very accommodating considering the location is fairly small. The drinks were very good and I loved the ambiance. I will definitely come back to try the tapas.,0
"I was really excited to try Think Dig Inn, as I love Asian food and this restaurant looked like it would have some great options for vegan diners. I was not disappointed! The bowls and bites are really clean and gourmet-style, and there are plenty of vegan options. The only downside is that the seating is limited, and it can be tough to get a table if you're looking for a group meal. Overall, I'm really happy with the food and would definitely recommend it. My boyfriend's meal was also great- he loved the roasted tomatoes and honey ginger salmon. All in all, it's a bit overpriced compared to comparable options, but the food is really good and I would definitely go back.",1
"Jardino is one of my favorite spots for gluten free pizza in the Upper East Side!I've gotten delivery from here multiple times and picked up once as well. I was surprised to see how it's basically counter service only inside; all of their table seating is outside. The prices made me think this was a larger spot, but for such a small space, they do pizza really really well. It's the floury, neopolitan style crust (even on the gluten free version), and even the ingredients on the simple margherita are spot on. Jardino has a whole range of pastas, entrees, and appetizers too but I've never felt the need to branch out because the pizza is *that* good!My only complaint: I wish they were open later. They close at 9:30pm, which by NYC pizza standards, is super early. But if you happen to be in the area, I would hesitate to recommend picking up from this spot!",0
The cocktails here are really good and the service is great. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a good night out!,1
"The mermaid inn was an amazing restaurant. The ambiance was just perfect and the service was wonderful. Our lovely server quickly came over after we were seated to ask us our water preference and if we wanted any cocktails. She didn't make us feel like we were wasting our time by not ordering any alcohol. The oysters were amazing and I've never had lobster knuckles before, but I will definitely be ordering them again. The salads were fresh and crisp, and Jeffrey really enjoyed the wedge salad. We'll definitely be back!",1
"Do you shine your shoes with new fancy polish? Or with Old Traditional Polish? Well this is the latter. Oh wait it's a restaurant.Ate here awhile back, wanted to come back to decide between 4 and 5 stars. Had sausage last time, wasn't feeling well that day.My first stop in NYC on the September trip, my first meal was supposed to be the Polish truck and then I realized the location was different - so then it was going to be my third stop.As it happened it was not a meal stop at all because the damn thing closed much earlier than Google said it did, and much earlier than the truck itself said it would.For once Yelp was right, Yelp was the only place that had it closing earlier, and it did - even earlier than Yelp said.So for future reference: Basically whichever one says that you're going to get screwed over is the one that is right. They should keep the hours posted though.",0
"Higher end Chinese food located in upper east side. When you hear the name of the place; you've just enter pig world. They got pig status right outside and in the bathroom, super cute. For app we ordered the soup dumplings which was so freakin good and the fried dumps. Which they give you a sauce tray with 4 diff sauces. For main we ordered the BBQ PORK RIBS, they're known for this dish. Sticky honey glazed ribs! Omg + everything is family style so larger portions. I wanted more pork ribs tho :) We also ordered the Beef hotpot which also comes in either fish or beef. Spicy so if you can take a heat, you'll love this with a side of rice. They also do Peking duck, carved table side for you!  Check it out",0
I was super excited to try Boucherie for my 30th Birthday. Unfortunately my expectations were not met with this dinner. Everything was just subpar or average and I expected more.The ambiance is beautiful and my aperol spritz was perfectly made. Otherwise like I said the food was mediocre and the bone marrow was inedible. The restaurant staff seems frazzled and understaffed. I'm not sure if I will be back.,0
"Overall, we had a good experience at this restaurant. The HK Milk Tea was very authentic and not too sweet, the fried dough rice roll was fine, and the shrimp and chive rice roll was good. However, we didn't like the chives and cabbage in the shrimp rice roll, and the fried steamed buns were well fried and very tasty.",1
"La Savane is a great little spot in my neighborhood that I hadn't heard of before. The servers were attentive and served us quickly, and the portions were pretty large - I wasn't able to finish it all. The fish was well-seasoned and cooked well, with a nice sauce accompanying it. The fish also came with a fish soup that was really good. The Plantains were good too - they cut them up in smaller pieces than I'm used to but they were cooked well. Overall, a great spot that I will keep on my radar for future dinner spots.",1
"Ordered this for delivery and came in 40 minutes on the dot! This meal was exactly what I needed during covid. Dumplings: don't underestimate its spiciness- but that's also exactly what made it so good. Fish: doesn't get any better! The fish itself was really big and had a ton of meat, and it was perfect for two people. We were able to finish it in one sitting! Would also recommend dipping the fish into the sauce surrounded, to give it more flavor. The sauce was also great with rice! Snow-pea: also great, tasted fresh. Only thing is, not sure if it's because of the current situation but it was $17 for the vegetables, which I don't recall paying that much for before? Delicious and ordered it nonetheless, was just surprised at the pricing!",0
"I recently visited this restaurant and I have to say that it was a pretty good experience. The staff here are actually fluent in Vietnamese and Cantonese, which was really nice. The food was really good, too. I ordered the pho bo vien and a banh mi. Both were delicious. The only downside was that the restrooms were a bit on the small side, but overall they were clean and adequate. I would definitely come back here.",1
Stopped in to toscana 49 for an early dinner/late lunch.  The restaurant was pretty busy for 5pm on a Saturday and while we definitely didn't need a reservation I would recommend making one because they got busy really fast!  The waiter brought out bread and marinara sauce.  I think that the bread may have been frozen because the piece i pickled up was soggy.  The marinara sauce was very oily and had a strange taste to it.  I didn't like it very much at all.  I ordered the melon and prosciutto as an app.  The melon was a bit hard and the prosciutto was flat on the plate underneath the melon and there wasn't very many pieces of melon which was a bit odd.  For dinner I had the veal piccata which was excellent however it was served with asparagus which could have been cooked a bit longer.  The veal was tender and the piccata sauce was delicious.  Despite my best efforts not to I ordered the chocolate mousse cake for dessert and I was delicious.  I'm mad at myself for eating so much.,0
Came here during the summer. They set up a small section in the street to have seating. We were lucky to get a seat. You can order up at the window or you can walk inside to order as well. The pizza prices are high but the quality is definitely worth it. I was full from slice 1. If your paying with a card I believe there is a minimum of $10. I want to go back and try this double layer pizza I saw on their instagram. I will have to go when I don't have as many guests because it's a costly slice.greay location near all the happening spots in the area including st marks,0
Love love love! The lady who worked here was so nice and friendly and the food tasted amazing. The service was amazing she gave us free dumplings on the house and the steamed egg was free as well. Would definitely come back because of the service and food!,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was super friendly and the location was great. The decor was really cool, too - definitely a place I would recommend to others. However, the sushi itself wasn't my favorite - but they do serve Brooklyn Kura, which is always a bonus. The HH drink deal was really nice, too.",1
"Most overrated pizza in New York. I've had friends visit, insisting that they've heard it's amazing, forgoing my recommendations, just to be disappointed. I don't think their sauce, cheese, or crust is elite. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad pizza, but it's truly just ""fine"". Service is quick - handy option in SoHo. It's worth checking out once in your life to say you've gone but that's it. 3 stars MAX just for that.",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed our time at Pings Seafood. The wait was definitely worth it, as we were all very full by the end of our meal. The food was delicious - I especially loved the shrimp dumplings and pork shumai. The vibe was also really nice, with a quiet and private downstairs area. The service was also great, with our table constantly being served food and our tea never running out. Overall, I would definitely recommend Pings Seafood to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.",1
"Came to Rosa Mexicano for dinner. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and chips and salsa. A quick note that as of this writing, the restaurant does not have its liquor license, even though they have an extensive liquor menu.Overall, the food seems to be overpriced-- $20-30 items for small portions, and the menu is relatively small, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The chicken quesadilla seemed to be the best value. While the food was tasty, there were large gaps in the quesadilla that lacked any cheese or chicken, and some parts were largely just the tortilla.While our waiter was friendly, he only came twice-- to take our order and to give us the bill. He never checked on us to see if our food was good or if we needed anything, and only refilled the water once. Mind you, it was a relatively quiet Tuesday night.",0
"Ordered the pho tai and would have to say it's pretty underwhelming.   Broth lacked any flavor and depth.   Didn't try any other foods, but would not recommend this place for pho.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent. The ramen was definitely rich and flavorful, but it was also quite salty. The cha siu was also a bit bland for my liking, and it would've been better if it was thicker. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good ramen experience.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and had a good time. The bottomless food deal is a great value, and the food was tasty. The only downside was that the restaurant wasn't my favorite. I likely wouldn't return, but the deal is worth checking out.",1
"I had a great time at Beauty & Essex! The atmosphere was really cool and the drinks were amazing. I especially loved the coco espresso martini. The only downside was that the dishes were a bit small for the price, but overall I was really satisfied with my experience. I would definitely come back for dinner.",1
"The food was good but not great. I thought the spinach artichoke dip was really good, but the veggie burger was not my cup of tea. The location is great and the service was good. I would come back but only if the food is better.",1
"Dark, fun little Mexican spot with a great drink menu. We had a great experience the night we went and we will definitely be back. My friend was late arriving to dinner and I was fortunate enough to have the lovely hostess put a reserve sign on a bar seat next to me as I awaited. Since the place was empty at 6:15pm I was surprised she did that. But 10 minutes later the place was packed!!!While I waited I tried more than one of their specialty margaritas ranging from coconut infused to jalapeño spiked and liked each one. And I almost got full on the chips and salsa before we ordered dinner. In the end, the Ceviche was fresh, the tacos were great, and the rice and beans were delicious. We loved every plate and drink. Arrive there early as the seats go fast! But if you have to wait, it's worth it.",0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The menu was incredibly limited, and the prices were way too high for what we were getting. The drinks were actually pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend coming here for food.",1
"I'd been excited to try Gyu-Kaku since 2018 LOL. Took my wife and I four years to actually try it due to unforeseen circumstances such as COVID-19 and other cravings. We finally popped in yesterday and got lucky with a table! The host seated us in a booth in the back corner facing 50th and 3rd - it was a good view. We had missed happy hour by about a minute, but our server was awesome enough to let us pay the hh pricing!We went with the HH Meal for Two, I got a mug of Kirin and wife got a cocktail. The food experience was subpar. For starters, my Kirin tasted flat. My wife found a ladybug in her salad, which isn't the most disgusting thing, but still. However, one of the beef meats was fuego. I'm not sure exactly which meat it was, but in my picture it was the one on the top right. Everything else was just kinda there.Although customer service was good, the overall food experience just wasn't there for us.3/5 Yelp stars. Don't think we'll be back.",0
"I absolutely loved KazuNori The Original Hand Roll Bar! The wait was a little bit long, but it was worth it. The sushi was great and the price was really affordable. I would definitely come back here!",1
This restaurant hit the spot for me! The vegan rice rolls were delicious and had a great mix of flavors. I especially loved the shiitake mushrooms and the shiitake truffle sauce. I would definitely order them again.,1
"Got the chicken and spicy pork one. The pork has so much fat. Purple rice was not purple rice and has no flavor and was not cooked enough. The place smell weird the ventilation was bad. Food is okay, like meh, like why. Not cheap is fine but low quality is not okay. Staffs look so bored at their job, no facial expression, not friendly, awkward.",0
"Sojourn definitely knows how to put on a show! The staff were attentive and accommodating, always making sure we had everything we needed. The food was top-notch, with my favorite dish being the duck spring rolls - they were delicious and the plum sauce was perfect. The salmon was also really good, with crispy skin and a tender interior. The only downside was that the flourless chocolate cake wasn't as good as I had hoped, but the Nutella, caramel sauce, bourbon, and ice cream made up for it. All in all, a great meal!",1
"I love coming to tacombi for their food! Every location I have been to so far has had great service along with delicious food!For valentines day, the hubby and I went to the Empire state building and I decided to bring him to tocombi since Empire state building offered the prefixed dinner voucher. $15.51 plus applicable sales tax and tip for a grand total of $19.99. We got 2 vouchers. Each one included 1 appetizer, a choice of 4 served family style tacos per person and unlimited homemade refreshing Mexican fruit drinks. When we got there, we were told that the menu had changed but wasn't updated on the Empire state building website and it was 2 tacos per person which was a let down. So we got Guac and Corn Esquites as our apps. Both were good but the corn was out of this world! Sooo soo good and worth trying! The Guac was a smooth blend of Haas avocados, jalapeno, red onions and lime juice thatch made fresh through out the day for the best fresh taste & it's served with homemade Vista Hermosa tortilla chips A for the tacos we got the Beef babacua tacos! Loved them! Squeeze some lime juice which will make each bite as finger licking good as the next.We ordered margaritas even tho they were not included because you cant have great tacos without great drinks!The service was great throughout the night.",0
Wow the nonna maria & the sicilian pizza were sooo amaaaazing!!! So damn delicious! It is jam packed with flavors on a thin crust! I regret not getting a pie! Bleeker Street Pizzeria is on my top 3 favorite pizza in NYC at this time.Ordering was quick and efficient. The guy placed the 2 pizzas in the oven and in a few minutes those babies came out piping hot!,0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my brunch at this restaurant. The service was wonderful, and the waitress was very sweet. The food was also delicious, with my favorite being the garlic bread. However, the Oreo cake was not up to my standards - it was a little dry and lacked flavor. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, but just skip the dessert if you're looking for something sweet.",1
"I was really happy with my experience at Vezzo! The pizza was delivered hot and fresh, and my daughter loved the mushroom side the most. She was really happy with the surprise gift, and the doorman (using strict social distancing) was grateful too! Thanks Vezzo for helping me make my daughter's day a little brighter!",1
"Having been to their midtown location and enjoyed it, I was surprised and delighted to see that Farida has built a downtown outpost. Despite still being in the soft opening phase, this is already an amazing addition to our neighborhood food scene. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. But last night, Farida's husband gave us his recommendations which were spot on.  Here's what we had:* Umka puff pastries (not pictured because we ate them too fast). They come out piping hot and the fillings are delicious - especially the beef and spinach with herbs. * A specially prepared medley of the three best salads - vitamin salad, avocado tomato salad, and navruz salad. All were quite tasty, but the avocado tomato salad was the star and an excellent pairing with a heartier main dish.* Uzbek plov (pilaf), is one of the most traditional dishes. A beautifully seasoned medley of beef, lamb, carrots, rice, and chickpeas. This is his grandfather's recipe, who got it from HIS grandfather.  Unsurprisingly, they sell out daily in the busy midtown location. If you can order this, I highly recommend you do. In addition to terrific food, they offer a cozy atmosphere with interesting murals and Central Asian music videos, playing in the background. They also have a unique selection of wines from Russia, Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, Kazakstan, as well as the other more typical regions of Europe and South America. Apparently, they're going to be offering belly dancing and hookah in the near future. I look forward to checking that out as well.",0
Dropped by while in area and mixed feelings about my experience. First time eating ramen in person in a while. Initially ask for vaccine card in beginning. I was seated in corner of 1 person seating facing the kitchen. i checked in via Yelp app and selected the free matcha pudding with red bean since the other free option thai iced tea is part of my combo order. I ordered #6 spicy ramen combo with pork bao bun and Thai iced tea. Overall quick service my ramen came before my bao bun and then had to chase them down for my free item and Check. Overall flavor of pork bao bun..pork belly was just ok not cooked crispy like I've had it in other place and the sauce super watered down. Ramen broth was just ok and not as spicy as expected. The matcha pudding was bland of flavor as well. Add the half and half cream on top and mixed in. But have had better. You can tell this is very high volume business but for a ramen specialty place ..all quality is in the broth and this was a miss hence 3 stars.,0
"This restaurant currently has indoor and outdoor dining. They have dividers up between tables and they take your temperature before you enter the restaurant. You also have to fill out a form for covid protocol. The interior is really nice which complements the ambiance. For appetizers, we got the Tom yum soup and curry puffs. They were delicious! The Tom yum has more mushrooms than usual, but I love mushrooms so I loved it. For entrees, we got pad see ew, green curry and pad krapow. All were delicious. The pad see ew had a hint of sweetness though which I wasn't too big of a fan of, but it still tasted good. My favorite entree was the pad krapow. The service was really nice and friendly. Overall I'm really happy with my experience here. The food was good and the restaurant was following all COVID regulations.",0
"I came here with two others and we took advantage of the happy hour menu. I remember the cocktail had yuzu and sparkling wine in there and it was decent. I also separately ordered the scallop roll and we shared bbq cauliflower. Everything was decent and restrooms were nice. The scallop roll was really teeny tiny portion though. It was $16.00 so I thought it was one of those special rolls but it came out looking like a $3.50 yellow tail roll. I wasn't that hungry so it was enough for me, but for a normal human being (not me), it def wouldn't be enough. Small but it was very tasty. I would come back for the scallop roll even though it was so tiny.",0
"Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that it was a bit crowded and the waiters were spread thin, but they always attended to us quickly. Overall, we would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"Dinner with friends Tuesday 7pm. Needed the whole party to be here before giving you a buzzer. Luckily it was only a five min wait after getting the buzzer. We sat upstairs. Turns out there were a bunch of empty tables so idk why we even needed to go through the buzzer that never buzzed. We shared a fried pork belly and kimchi fries for appetizers. The pork belly was literally fried on the outside, has a crunchy skin. I wasn't a fan of that skin but it didn't bother me. The description of the sauce was more exciting than it actually was...There were distinct layers of fat. I would spit it out but it didn't bother me, like no feeling of oiliness. The meat itself has a slight old/reheated taste to it Kimchi fries were ok...Except the fries were over fried, not completely hard around but getting there. The insides were almost empty Both my friends got pho. I got the laksa. The broth was watery, not rich at all, can almost see through it. There were approx 5 pieces of shrimp and a bunch of (I can't even tell anymore) chicken or pork slices. The problem is that the chicken/pork slices had the same old/fridge taste as the pork belly, but WORSE. I'm surprised by the size and amount of shrimp but I didn't like the texture of the shrimp. The noodles are the round translucent chewy type. I actually like that even though I know it's not traditional laksa type of noodles. Interesting how the noodles felt slightly too salty even tho the broth didn't have that feeling.  PS I feel smelly coming out of this place",0
"I used to love this place. We have been going here for years for their hot and savory, clean and bright cooking and great service. (The wine was always terrible so we simply didn't order it, and that was okay.) No more. The server botched the order and the food was bland. Things change. Sometimes for the worst.",0
"Red Rooster is always a great place to eat in New York City. This time, we went for lunch and it was perfect. The service was great and our server, Rahan (sp), was very attentive. The food was all excellent, but the desserts were not as great as the rest of the meal. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend Red Rooster to anyone visiting the city.",1
"I was disappointed that my reservation at B Cafe was not honored. I called to make the reservation and was told that they couldn't guarantee seating in the garden or outdoor dining, though large parties are usually seated in the garden or sidewalk shed. I clarified that I was only interested in dining in the garden - we weren't interested in dining on the sidewalk and definitely not open to indoor dining, which is why I was making a reservation. Two years into a pandemic, this doesn't seem like an unusual request. The host said she would make a note about our preference and have her manager call me the next evening to sort it out. No one called me back the next evening, or the day after that. I decided to host the brunch at another restaurant with garden dining.",1
Came here for brunch today!!! I got the skirt steak sandwich on a Portuguese roll and my friend got 2 baked eggs in a green tomatillo shakshuka sauce. The food was great but we were a little underwhelmed with the portion size- we left still a little hungry which of course wasn't the end of the world but we were just kind of surprised. The place was packed and there were many groups waiting outside for a table when we were on our way out. I'd give this place another try for sure and probably just order an app to start! 3.5/5 stars,0
"Bryant Park Grill is a good option for a quick city date. The service is attentive and the cocktails are tasty. The food is good, but the hanger steak could use a pinch more salt. The fries are passable, but you need more than passable fries if serving steak frites. The grilled chicken sandwich comes with a mountain of chicken, but no accompaniment, no salad, no nothing. It's a sandwich on a plate, like it was a steakhouse. The sandwich is tasty, but it looks weird sitting on that big plate. The costs are not nutty, but I didn't look too hard at the tab.",1
"Cathedrale is a beautiful restaurant with delicious food. The service was a bit slow, but overall the experience was great. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great brunch or dinner.",1
"Had lunch at Kyma yesterday...Restaurant is quite pretty and very clean. It was about 20% full at 2pm when we arrived.Service is slow and awkward. Not a smile to be found. Food comes out quickly though, which is good.Food itself is just okay. Everything is just ... lacking.Dolmas were mushy and needed salt.Branzino was pretty good and the accompany horta was delicious.Brussels sprouts salad was bland (per my husband).Chicken skewer was small but tasty (also per my husband).Prices weren't too bad because we ordered from the $29 lunch menu. Overall there are way better Greek restaurants at the same price point...we won't be returning.",0
The food was great and the service was fast and efficient. I'm giving 4 stars for their staples and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and easy meal.,1
"Overall, the food is quite good, but it can be quite expensive. The sampler platter of spicy pork butt, gochuchang wrap, and sticky rice is good, but nothing really stands out. The price is also quite high, so you can probably get similar things at other Korean BBQ places for a cheaper price. The Oiji bowl of sea urchin, sweet shrimp, and pickled vegetables tasted good, but it was overpriced. The small portion size was a downside, but the presentation was great. I'm not sure if I would pay this price again for this dish, but the waygu beef was good. I couldn't taste the thin slices of beef in the overwhelming amount of sauce, but the sauce tasted good. I would never pay another $36 for this dish, though.",1
"Really liked the original location but this one leaves a lot to be desired. It's been open for a little over a month but they are waiting for their alcohol permit for their official grand opening.  Value and food quality here is just not as good as the original spot.   A burger, chicken sandwich, soda and small fries came to $35 (without tip)! Even Shake Shack is cheaper!First, had the chili burger for $13. Burger is served plain with chili on the side.  And the chili has beans :/  Anyone who has had a proper chili burger will know you don't put beans in a chili for a sandwich!  The burger itself was tasty but the chili felt like an after thought.The fries were tiny and under salted. Nothing remarkable here.The chicken sandwich tasted like the premade frozen Sysco supermarket chicken breasts - definitely a hard pass on that.Overall, service was good but food and value is just not there.  Service: 4/5Food: 2.5/5Value: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5",0
"I had a really enjoyable time at this restaurant! The hot dog and sangria deal is unbeatable, and the food was really good too. The outdoor seating is really beautiful, and I loved the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I had a fantastic time at this restaurant. The food was amazing and the service was top notch. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite small, so it was hard to get a seat. But overall, I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone in the area.",1
San Blas is a nice addition adding even more diversity to the options on Montague Street. The service is friendly and the food is decent Mexican for a good price. I like the option to mix & match thetacos and hope that with time they will expand their menu to also include some inventive items as well as get their liquor license.,0
"The pepperoni pizza at this restaurant is a bit different than what you're used to. It's not a typical New York slice, and I didn't enjoy it as much as a typical slice. The crust is thin and easy to overcook, and the sauce is light and not very flavorful. The cheese and pepperoni are good, but the slice was a bit too small for my taste. I would recommend trying the heritage sausage and al pastor by the slice instead.",1
"I always enjoy visiting 99 Favor Taste because of their all you can eat hot pot selection. The broth selection is always great and I love the tomato one. My favorite meat to get is the fatty beef and thankfully this place is all you can eat because we never seem to get enough of it! The wait can be pretty long if you have a large party and no reservation, but the food is definitely worth it. The service here is okay, depending on how busy it gets.",1
"I had a great experience at Go Sushi! The delivery was fast and efficient, and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the crab rangoons, and the red bean bun was also a great choice. I only had a couple of complaints, but overall I was very happy with my experience.",1
"Wanted to introduce a friend to a traditional jian bing experience and stopped by Yiwanmen. Tiny interior but friendly, fast service and delicious food! The perfect on the go snack/lunch. Would happily return.",0
"Ordered Oki Poke and Ramen on a weekday for lunch on seamless. I went with 1 pork steamed bun and the tonkutsu miso ramen. Ramen came in the perfect bowl with the noodles and all ingredients (egg, fish cake, pork, scallion, nori) aside from the broth in a separate container. Flavor was great!! Not too salty either, but they do have a version with lower sodium. The pork in the steamed bun was very tender. Would definitely order from here again!",0
"I wish I could give them 3.5 stars. I think this would be a fun place to bring a big group, especially with their winter dining setup, but everything about this place was just fine. We showed up on time for our reservation and still had to wait. Service wasn't the fastest, food and drinks were just ok, not the most flavorful or well made. All the plates were super small which meant you had to order a ton for a party with more than two people. I would order the preset menu for simplicity as it wasn't the easiest menu to navigate. Overall I was just underwhelmed. They have such a cool concept and seating area that I wanted to love, but a lot of it fell flatFollow me on Instagram @eatenbysteph",0
"I first was introduced to this place by a guy friend that had a crush on me since college. He's tried making moves here and there, but I ignored his advances because I just thought of him as a friend. Until we eventually had the talk and I flat out told him I do not want to date him. Fast forward to today, we do not talk. Guess a man and woman cannot just be friends.... Anyways, he introduced this place to me and I just loved this place. The issue back then was that they didn't take reservations and the wait was so long because the food is good, the place is small, and the price is pretty good for a NYC joint. After a few years, I went here with an ex and he loved it as well. I remember we shared a fish cake hot pot that I was so happy about because my ex had a ridiculously particular diet (which my body really should be following because it helps my gut issues along with other issues, but I love food too much) that he didn't eat most things. No gluten was the angriest one. Fast forward to today, I seamless or ubereats from this place all the time. I love the fish cake soup, the mentaiko pasta, and the volcano roll. I honestly recommend going there now and get the full on experience, their vodka sodas are to die for! One of very few places I enjoy around the area they are located in!",0
The atmosphere at this bar was great. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The shots we ordered were fantastic and the bartender was super nice. We would definitely recommend stopping by if you're looking for a good time.,1
"Overall, I thought the food was good but the portions were really small and the service was really rushed. I would recommend checking out some other great Italian restaurants in the city before coming here.",1
"Overall, we had a good experience at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria. The food was good, and the service was okay. The only downside was that the portions were small.",1
I had the classic noodle dish at Ho Foods and it was delicious! I was surprised by the favor of the broth - it was really flavorful. I'll definitely be back to try the wider noodles.,1
"One of the restaurants at the cafeteria in Koreatown. Their food is mediocre. Nothing really impressive. And for the price, their servings are not that generous. Prolly cuz I'm too used to Queens. The staff are nice tho, o should give it to them, and it was pretty quick. Was my second time here I figured I might give it another shot in case they improved but NO. That was it for me.",0
"Los Tacos No.1 is a must-try when visiting NYC! The Carne Asada (Grilled Steak) tacos were so tender and flavorful, and the Adobada (Marinated Pork) tacos were also amazing. I especially loved the fresh tortillas - you can literally see them being made right in front of you. The salsa bar was a nice touch, too. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"I quite enjoyed my recent meal at the little restaurant near Mount Sinai UES. The food was pretty tasty and the prices were reasonable. I particularly enjoyed their Fried Chicken Thighs and their Seasoned Garlic Beef. The only downside was that the Jaeo sauce was a bit bland for my taste. However, the boba drinks were a nice touch. I would recommend their lunch specials if you're looking for a more affordable option.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The $5 pork belly appetizer was really delicious, and the Tan Tan Men ramen was really good as well. I think it would be great if they made the ramen a little spicier, but overall I really enjoyed it. The location is great, right next to Bibble and Sip. I'll definitely be back!",1
5-Star for the decor and ambiance. 4-Star for the Sangria pitcher and drinks. (They are pretty tasty. They make a great Whiskey Sour) 5-Star for service. Our gal was great! I bet it's nice during the summer time too. Just love this little spot. It really feels cozy and easy gathering place for friends or coworkers. Saw that some people brought kids there but you need to make reservations just in case.,0
Definitely one of the best places to eat in NYC. It's hard to walk away from this place when I'm nearby. Their falafels are fantastic and the shawarma  is cooked to perfection. The meat itself tastes better than any other place I've tried and it's charred slightly to give it that lovely Smokey taste.Not sure if the east village (st marks place) fixed the issue with their shawarma. Because theirs is not cooked as nicely as this place and isn't charred properly.Please visit this place as it is cheap and always great to see eat. This hole in the wall has so much value and your order is always quick. Cheers!,0
"Candle Cafe is a great place for a casual meal, but it lacks the flavor and depth to really make it stand out. The quesadilla was good, but not as great as I've had elsewhere. The Cajun sandwich was also good, but could have been spicier. The sweet potato fries were a great addition, and the mimosa was also good. Overall, I had a good time at Candle Cafe, but I would not go out of my way to visit again.",1
3 Times 茅庐 is a great place to go for a traditional Chinese meal. The fried calamari and drunken chicken are both delicious and the service is prompt and friendly. The only downside is that the a la carte menu is limited.,1
"Made reservation through Resy after seeing this place hyped on social media. I was hoping this place would be comparable to the best one and only Kazu Nori. My bf got the signature set and I chose 5 pieces myself. The presentation is definitely IG worthy, they wrapped the nori with plastic so you have to carefully pull it so it doesn't break the pieces.   Taste is the only problem here, they all tasted very bland, even those with sauces on top. For example, the unagi is dry, not soft at all. The cucumber with the sauce barely tasted like anything. The seabass just tasted like gochujang sauce. Again, for the price I'd rather go to Kazu Nori.PS: portion is also very small and not filling (at least not for me & my bf) we ate ramen and dessert after our lunch here.  Service was good even with seating outdoor, beware though the outdoor for winters are still pretty cold as they only have portable heater in a open outdoor setup.",0
"Came to Voula with a friend last night, and it was an amazing experience. From the ambience, to the service, to their decor - the overall vibe was incredible. It felt like we were in a modest, upscale Greek restaurant without it being too fancy that it would make us feel like we didn't belong. The servers were very welcoming and friendly, and service was great. I would highly recommend coming here for Mediterranean food.What we got: - Pan-Seared Feta (with fig marmalade, my favorite!!!)- Kolokithakia & Meltizanakia Tiganita (lightly battered zucchini and eggplant chips)- Spanakopita (traditional spinach & cheese pie)- Mixed Grill for Two (comes with beef, lamb chops, chicken skewers, and Greek Fries)- Baklava The food was very good. My favorite was the Pan-Seared Feta appetizer. I've never had anything like it. The fig marmalade was a great touch to the app giving every bite sweet and savory notes, and the sesame coating gives it all sorts of textures. I enjoyed the zucchini and eggplant chips very much. Chips are my kryptonite, so I felt less guilty digging into these. The Baklava was slightly too sweet for me, but my friend absolutely loved, and devoured the dessert.After sharing 3 appetizers we were already full, so when the Mixed Grill came out, we were trying really hard to dig into it. If you are a party of two, I would recommend getting two appetizers if you are going to share a large dish because we ended up bringing it home. Despite us slowly working on finishing our meal, we didn't feel rushed at all. The waiters were highly attentive, and the vibe was very chill. I always appreciate it when restaurants don't rush you and let you enjoy your dining experience. Overall, it was a great experience at Voula, and I can't wait to come back.",0
"I came to this restaurant with my group of four on a Sunday afternoon and we ordered the papaya salad, a diversity of noodles and calamari. The food was decent and delicious, the portions were generous and I would say that this is a neighbourhood staple for Thai food. The food wasn't on the sweet side of Thai food, if that's what you're looking for. The prices were fair and the waitress was friendly. The service was fast and efficient. I would definitely come back!",1
"I had a great time at Nakaji, but I don't think it would be my top pick for sushi in NYC. The chef is very skilled and the variety of seafood that he sources is unbelievable. However, I had a problem with how cold the fish was. It's upsetting that the uni supplement costs $70 (3 types of uni) - I imagine this is done to keep the base price down. The meal is very long; we were there for 3 hours. We waited 20 mins before we were served any food. And I expected to be blown away by more. Everything was good but only a few pieces were amazing. And there was no tamago.",1
"Great service, spectacular ramen. Will be back and have been back multiple times (~3-4 x already) as I live around the neighborhood. Always friendly staff. Definitely recommend the karaage chicken as an app + can't go wrong with their Teppen Shio or Shoyu. Honestly can't go wrong with any of their ramens - even if you like spicy they have that option for you too. Will be back!",0
"Full disclosure, I won the Instagram raffle and this was mostly a free meal. That said, it was very enjoyable. So aside from the a la carte menu, there's two tasting menus. Menu A is more traditional and menu B is more fusion. We opted for menu A. We started with the fried calamari and drunken chicken. The drunken chicken was very heavy with booze, it was great. Next we had the fried pork dumplings and chive cake. Both were traditional and quite good. For the mains, we had the braised ribs and duck yolk shrimp. I really enjoyed both. The ribs were super tender and fall off the bones. If you like egg yolk covered anything, you'll love the shrimps. We also added the lion's head just to try it. The sauce is not as thick as it traditionally is, but I actually prefer it this way. There's less sugar in it. Overall the meal was enjoyable and the service was prompt and friendly.",0
"I had a great time at Tacombi! The prices are reasonable, the vegetarian-friendly menu is great, and the space is really fun and high-ceilinged. The margaritas are good and the quesadillas are delicious - I especially love the al pastor pork in them. The service has always been great here, and I've never had to wait long for my food. Overall, I highly recommend Tacombi - it's a great place to eat Mexican food in the city!",1
"I had a great lunch at Ritual yesterday - the Chicken Biryani was delicious. It was huge chunks of chicken and the portion size was generous. I saved half of it for another lunch this week and it was still really good the next day. I requested mild spice, but appreciated that there was still a little kick to it (I prefer some spice than none at all, especially with Indian food!) and that they packed a side of raita (white sauce). So delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot.",1
"I had a great time at this ramen restaurant. The noodles here are a bit thicker than at other ramen joints, which I really enjoy. The broth is also really thick and delicious, and I got the eak ramen which I really liked. The asian fries were also delicious, and I enjoyed the mentai dipping sauce. The service was a bit slow, but the food was so good that it made up for it. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
I really like this restaurant! It's a great concept and the sauce is really good. The only problem is that the slices of pizza are a little hard and the pizza never comes out very hot. But overall I really enjoy it and it's close to my home.,1
We ordered two gluten free pizzas to go and both were good although the broccoli rabe on the Ribalta was very bitter. The balance was off as we felt there wasn't enough white sauce and cheese and too much broccoli rabe. Overall though the quality was good and we would come back.,1
"Osteria 57 has the makings of a top notch italian spot. The outdoor area is nicely made and was packed at the time we came. We sat inside and it had a quaint aesthetic that made us feel relaxed.We started with the cauliflower tempura, spinach ricotta dumplings, and ricotta on toast special. I enjoyed the cauliflower tempura and it had a nice crunch to it. The spinach ricotta dumpling was one of the more interesting things I have tried anywhere. Its not pasta but it is not quite a dumpling. It was a little too cheesy for me but not bad. The ricotta toast was average. Skip it. For entrees I went with the halibut but it was a little fishy and overcooked. The cacio e pepe was ok and I think it was made with store bought pasta which surprised me. It is a simple dish but it has to be done just right. It felt like ingredients didn't blend together. A perfect cacio e pepe is perfectly balanced. This one felt like all ingredients were separate. It is also a pricey place so not a cheap date!  In the end, Osteria is a cool spot and has a quaint vibe to it. The food fell a litte flat for me. Nothing sticks out to me as something I would come back for.",0
"I was a fan of Virginia's burgers when I first visited, and I was not disappointed when I returned to try them out again. The classic Virginia's burger is a great choice - the beef is nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the toppings are tastefully chosen. The side of fries are also excellent, and the Mexican sweet corn is a nice complement. Virginia's is open from Tuesday-Saturday from 5:30pm-10pm, making it a great option for a casual meal.",1
"I came to Mexicue around 1 PM on a Saturday. There was no wait at all, which was really nice!The place itself is pretty cute, with little plants and flowers scattered throughout the store. The brunch menu is pretty fairly priced for New York. Most of the items were around low to mid 10s. For 12 dollars, I got two breakfast tacos that made me really full. The tacos themselves did not look like a lot. But, it filled me up completely. It was also pretty oily. Perhaps they drenched oil on the tortilla. After eating it, my entire hands were greasy and I had to go to the restroom to wash it off. The tacos are pretty good but not amazing. However, after we ordered, the server asked if we wanted some guac and chips while waiting for our food to come. We thought it would be free or at most $6. However, when the bill came, the guac and chips were $12.75, which is more than our tacos!! We felt very lied to after looking at the check. The server did not say tell us how overpriced it is! Be careful when you come here and don't get scammed. Def don't get the guac and chips!! It's not worth the price!!!",0
"I came here again without knowing I came here before, but once I entered, I knew I've been here before and I remembered a negative impression of the place. I got the miso ramen this time (I was funnily debating between the miso and tan tan, which is what I think I got last time), and at least it was edible and I did not want to hurl. The meat was really flavorful and there were three slices, but the soup was really like and did not have any flavor at all. It was like drinking water! The noodles were perfectly chewy though, and the portions were good. Service was quite on-point too, as they repeatedly filled water and gave us menus, took orders, cleared the table, and gave us the check at appropriate times. My food came out to be a bit more than $15 post-tax pre-tip, which is quite typical for ramen. I was also really thirsty for the rest of the day which makes me suspect usage of MSG.",0
"So I come here religiously for boboa tea. They have a BOGO if you pay cash. So I buy two. (I have no self control) they have many flavors of milk tea as well as fruit teas. They also serve the best smelling dried hot pot inhave ever smelled. The have an assortment of ingredients to choose from. They draw in a decent growed of college students and couples so it can get crowded. The seating area is very clean and they clean between customers. The price is moderate and the food is weighed. What I dont like: sometimes the workers go on break and smoke. They leave the side door open which goes to the dining area and the smoke comes in. I dont want to smell cigarette smoke while I'm eating, not sure about others but you have been warned. All and all I really like this and think everyone should give it a try.",0
"Pretty decent spot, when I went on a Monday night. There was no line and I got my food in 4 minutes. It tasted pretty good and the price wasn't that expensive. The birria soup was flavored too. The only down side was that some of the soup was pouring out the contain and onto the bad so it was drenched. I'd come back here again tho.",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The pepperoni slice was really delicious and had a lot of flavor - the cheese and sauce added tons of flavor. The crust was also delicious and crispy. I can't wait to come back and try more things!,1
"I was really surprised by the vegan food at this restaurant. It was good, and I was full and satisfied after eating it. I don't think I'll go here everyday, but I will go here at least once or twice a week if the worker in the back stopped talking smack about the ""Chinito"" waiting for his food up front and yes I understand Spanish lol.",1
Good spot. Fast delivery and great taste. The only thing I did not like was the dry chicken in the chauffa. The soy honey wings are to did for though.,0
"DO NOT GO HERE THIS PLACE AND OWNER ARE DISHONEST. CHARGES MORE THAN THE LISTED PRICES AND OWNER WILL NOT ISSUE REFUND WHEN CALLED OUT ON DOING THIS!! (Pics for proof attached)Decided to stop in after reading good reviews online and taking a look at the menu outside. Upon entering, we noticed the prices on the menu inside were higher than what was listed outside. Not the biggest deal, but then after ordering and paying we noticed we were charged even more than what was listed on the menu inside. In fact, another couple at the restaurant also noticed and complained. The cashier ended up charging them the listed price however when it came to issuing us a refund for the same, the cashier was unable to do so on the register and upon calling THE OWNER to explain the situation, the owner said no to giving us the difference in money back. Not much more to say besides that this place and the owner are dishonest and mistreating customers, no wonder why it was empty on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.In case you were wondering, the sandwiches were mediocre at best, especially for $15-16 each. The ""free-range chicken"" we paid an additional $2.75 for resembled gas station quality meat that was more than obviously cooked in a microwave (see pics).My friend who was with me on this visit to City Sandwich oversees catering operations for a large company in the area that frequently brings in catering from City Sandwich and will no longer be ordering from here after this experience.",0
Your classic diner foods and service. Love that it's close by to many exhibits and activities. Not to busy on a weekday morning which I appreciated. We ordered the tuna melt and the grilled chicken Caesar wrap. Both sandwiches were filling and overall satisfying. The chicken wrap had great dressing with the chicken as it might have been slightly dry. Tuna melt was cooked well and I enjoy the variety of diner foods to choose from.,0
"I recently visited this restaurant and was very pleased with the food and service. The restaurant is on the newer side, but the atmosphere is quite nice. The menu is extensive and includes a variety of different items, both pre-made and for take out. I ordered the sweet and spicy chicken bowl and the spicy pork bowl, and both were really good. The chicken bowl was only $10, which is a great price for the location, and the pork bowl was $14 which wasn't bad at all. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good lunch option.",1
"I had a great lunch at Nish Nush yesterday. The dressings and the staff were both great. The pita bread was especially good - it was very wide and had a great flavor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick, healthy meal.",1
"Went here 7/2 for the first time and the food was not bad but it wasn't good. I got the steak, steak when you chewed it tasted like water. There was no flavor to it AT ALL. The waiter took the food back for me and I got the gyro and it was burnt, Dry and flavorless. Only thing that was good was the poutine. The gravy and the meat was delicious. I also got a couple of the drinks and they tasted like juice, spent all that money for the food to be okay",0
"Bolero is a great new Vietnamese restaurant that offers a delicious and modern menu. The service is attentive and pleasant, and the backyard is a beautiful addition to the restaurant. The pate was excellent, and my friends both enjoyed their beef pho. I would definitely recommend Bolero to anyone looking for a great Vietnamese meal.",1
"Grandma chicken mixian (4.5 stars): delicious and complex chicken based broth, with black sesame garlic oil, soft boiled tea egg. The chicken is in the style of pulled pork but actually quite tender. The broth was perfect for the chilly weatherBeef shank JB melt (5 stars): beef was very moist, and the pancake shell was crispy. Went very well with self serve chili oil. A bit messy but that's also a sign of a very flavorful sandwich. We made it a combo, as we wanted the extra broth. I loved it even more than the mixian broth, as it was much stronger in flavor, with a touch of Chinese medicinal herbs. The marinated cabbage came as a tiny side dishIt appears that this location operates more as a pick up/delivery spot, although there were a few other diners rotating in and out. No wait for 2 at 7pm Friday",0
"We were excited to try out this new Chinese restaurant downtown, and the other Yelp reviews were definitely promising. The outdoor seating was perfect for us - open air large square tables with an umbrella, perfect for COVID cautious dining with young kids.

We ordered the soup dumplings (pork and pork & crab), cucumber salad, hong kong style fried rice, rice dumpling with pork (zongzi / bahzhang / sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaf) and spicy shrimp wontons. Everything was freshly made and steamed to order, and the chilled cucumber salad was excellent - you can tell that they used chinkiang vinegar. Delicious and had a great homemade taste to everything.

The kids were happy too. We will definitely order from here again and visit during the pandemic.",1
"I enjoyed the vegetarian ramen here, though a friend says she likes the veggie ramen at the Westside location better. This broth is fairly strongly soy-flavored. We had a bit of a wait when we arrived. You can bring your coffee into the waiting area, but not into the dining area. The truffle fries were nice, though truffle flavour is sometimes a bit too subtle for me.",0
"I came here for a friends birthday party and I thought it was okay. The salad was good but the pasta was just okay. The sauce was soupy and the pasta was a little overcooked. The pasta was also very sweet. I didn't try the crustacean pasta, but the other pasta I tried wasn't very good either. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was too strong in seafood flavor.",1
This place is really disappointing- order a spicy pepperoni; it was cold; asked for reheat; it was STILL cold...,0
"I ordered from here using the Seamless app as they advertised having 25% off on the first order. I got the Lamb Shish Kebab Bowl which contained marinated cubes of lamb, rice, salad, hummus, and baked bread. Red and white sauce were also included. Which I liked using the red sauce to dip my bread in as I found it to have a nice kick. The food itself is pretty good and pretty filling.

The service there is what killed it for me as I tried explaining that I was here for a Seamless pickup order and they guy didn't understand what I was getting at and was pretty rude about it until another employee came to save the day.

The Seamless discount is what enticed me to give this place a try and although the food is decent, I hate dealing with rude people so because of that, I will most likely be avoiding this place.",1
"I was not sure if I came just before closing, but it seems that the restaurant just took a leftover dry overcooked paratha and added chicken and egg. I grew up having Kathi roll so I can say with authority this was a sloppy leftover that was given to me.",1
"The Sea Fire Grill is a must-visit restaurant for NYC restaurant week! The service and ambiance were both top-notch and the special menu had a great variety of dishes. My favorite dish was the Squid ink pasta with Maine lobster, and my partner's favorite was the NY strip with creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes. We would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great meal!",1
Great Valentine evening hanging with my Sister in Love and my niece in Love ended here with some apps and drinks after my time with the Mr. & our children.We need Carlito who was an amazing bartender who kept our glasses filled and tasty cocktails. We dined on an array of appetizers - lemon pepper cauliflower wings - Lemon pepper wings and hot wings- Papaya salad - Shrimp rolls Our drinks started off with us all having different drinks before we ended up having the same drinks plus plenty of shots from the bartender.This place is cute and quaint and perfect for drinks from our experience but it appeared that several people having dinner at tables and the place picked up pretty good after we hung for a hour or two at the bar.I look forward to heading back for more CHEERS moments.,0
Don't bother coming here.  We made a reservation for August for our date night. He got a confirmation but tried to call to check and no one picked up. He had the confirmation so we decided to give it a go since there were a few good reviews and nothing to indicate otherwise. Just a small number of reviews but we wanted to give them a chance.  Showed up to a completely blacked out restaurant. It would have been great for people to have notified. The restaurant is irresponsible and needs to be held accountable. I see now that others have run into the same issue so posting here to help others avoid this situation. Go elsewhere. I do not recommend because you'll end up wasting time that you won't get back and NYC is still a place that you typically need to plan ahead with reservations. Don't let this place throw a wrench into your plans.,0
"What a disappointment. They suddenly closed abruptly Wednesday Nov 24th due to covid outbreak. We were sad as we finally got a resi but the business ethics and response has left me feeling like maybe they don't deserve all the hype/business from locals. They cancelled the resi 5 min before. Bummer but safety is a concern and I get that. Later in the week they wrote they were back open, I messaged them letting them know how sad I was in hopes they would work with me to get a resi and instead asked my opinion on the situation, which I gave. I also suggested utilizing the HUGE outdoor dining area so people could feel more safe as we should try adapting to this new norm. There response ""you're not welcomed here""  - don't worry Saint Theo's I don't feel welcomed and will take my money else where.",0
Overall it was pretty decent pizza. It was a little over priced. I did appreciate that they had vegan cheese as well as labeled what was vegan on their menu. The crust was thin but that's the name of place. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. There was a girl in the back making drinks who started to rub her belly. She pulled her shirt up and started rubbing it with the gloves on. I couldn't confirm if she changed them or not because she went to the back. I was however watching to see if she touched any of the food which luckily she didn't. I would suggest that the staff really care on what they are touching when handling food.,0
"The Thai Noodle House is a small space with limited seating, so be prepared to wait for a table. The lunch special is a great deal, with 12 different noodle dishes to choose from. I ordered the kay mao noodles with shrimp, and it was delicious. My server was attentive and accommodating, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I haven't been here in years but really enjoyed coming back. It's hard to find good vegan crepes and they know how to make them savory and sweet! Amazing crepes (La Lolotte and La Paysanne) - flavorful, good size (big!), and absolutely delicious. Then the pea-protein egg with avocado purée, fresh bread, and spinach - such an egg-like texture and very good. All of this is ideal for sharing. The coffee is also excellent (oat milk cappuccinos pictured) - I've been here before just for coffee and it's worth it, though I would definitely prefer to order food as well!",0
"Prince Street Pizza is a great spot to go during the COVID-19 crisis. The wait was worth it, and the pizza was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
We popped in here for a quick drink ahead of dinner while in town and loved it. I wish we could have spent more time and enjoyed some of the charcuterie and fondue we saw others enjoying. The wine was fabulous and it was great service! (We actually asked to borrow a pair of scissors and they brought them out right away). Highly recommend and would love to come back!,0
"We should've known that it was mediocre by the fact that there was no line at 11:30am on a Saturday, but we decided to ignore our instincts. We ordered the tripe and the seafood/meat sample platter. The sample platter was unfortunately all over steamed and the peels were all falling off, and the tripe was extremely greasy. And the tea that they charged us for was some of the worst tea I've had. Save your money and go to literally any other dim sum place around here.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! I'm basically the opposite of a vegetarian and I'm Chinese, and I enjoyed everything I had here. In addition to what is pictured, my friend and I also got the steamed char siu bao. Each dish was super good and filling in its own way. Although the imitation meat filling in the lotus stick rice doesn't taste exactly like the meat in lo mai gai, the chinese dim sum counterpart, it's pretty close and delicious. The fragrant rice was infused with a mix of mushrooms and the traditional flavors of lo mai gai.

The pan fried buns were fluffier than expected and the filling was just carrot and cucumber, so I would skip it if you wanted to try more imitation versions of authentic dim sum.

Turnip cake was somewhat flimsy but delicious. I haven't had turnip cake at other Chinese restaurants so I can't compare but it was pretty good.

Indian pancake was greasy and had the texture of a scallion pancake without scallions. We thought it would be more like roti canai but it was still good especially with the potato curry dipping sauce.

Even if you're not",1
"The service was fast and friendly, and the food was good but nothing I would crave on a regular basis. The roti canai was flakey but didn't pick up the curry dip well, as the curry was a bit too runny. The prawn mee tasted singularly of only shrimp paste, and the chicken curry was fall off the bone tender, but was a bit too strong on peanut butter. Prices are cheap for the portion sizes, which are pretty big.",1
"Phew...I am drunk. Just had the bottomless drink special of Dutch's Punch. It sneaks up on you, fo sho.Great food, except the breakfast tacos were rejected and exhanged for a Huevos Rancheros. I ate enough to fill me so I need to walk the city for a bit.I truly enjoyed the french toast, the chicken and waffle, the Huevos Rancheros (favorite) and Dutch's Punch. I want more as it tastes like grapefruit juice and lemonade then you're drunk.Come, enjoy your time, ignore the bill as it sucks your vacation fund away. Good thing Central Park is free!",0
I had a really great experience at The Irishman! I was waiting on line and scored a sandwich from the parm menu - it was probably one of the best I've ever eaten. I'm definitely coming back for more - I've heard amazing things about the turkey sandwich.,1
"Initially I was super excited about this place having read the reviews after my then boyfriend/now husband brought me here for a romantic birthday dinner. Immediately upon walking in, the ambiance grabs you. It's extremely romantic, probably one of the most romantic restaurants I've been to in NYC. While the ambiance was excellent as was the service, the food was really unimpressive. I ordered scallops as an appetizer and salmon as the main course and both dishes were mediocre. I don't remember the dessert we had, but the overall culinary experience was very average.",0
"We were here on memorial day for dinner. The place was not busy. We got seated right away. I thought this would be a small place to eat inside a hotel but the place was spacious and the decor was good. We ordered the honey bee burger, hot chicken burger and side order of fries. The price was ok. Cost us 40$ excluding tip. The service was great.Service: 5/5Food: honey burger 4/5, hot chicken burger 4.25/5, fries 4/5Price: 3.75/5",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The pork belly buns were amazing and the ginger scallion noodles were delicious. The only downside was that it was a bit small for the price. The service was great and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal.,1
"The chicken and waffles were delicious, and our waitresses were very attentive. The only downside was that our food took a bit longer to arrive, but overall it was a great experience. The yams were a little too sweet, but the collard greens were a great contrast. The mac and cheese was amazing - definitely one of the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Came here for NYE dinner. I would give his place a solid 4. It truly is simple, as they market their restaurant, but I was hoping the food was a litttttle more sophisticated for the price. Atmosphere was good. Trendy, loud house and euro house music, good spot for a date or dinner with friends. Food wise overall a little too overpriced for the content and complexity of their food. Ex: $22 for a cucumber salad. We had the prosciutto for an appetizer which was one of the best parts of dinner. Loved the ricotta that came with it and the meat and focaccia were fresh. I ordered the 24k gold spaghetti purely for the vibes but the flavors were just good and only had 2 small pieces of uni. The ragu was delicious but simple, you can't really **** up ragu... and another friend had spaghetti which he said was ""pretty good"". The tiramisu dessert was solid but not memorable. Overall, a solid 4, simple and chic.",0
From the perfectly timed service to the excellent food. This was a treat.  Started with a raspberry mojito in a huge glass. Tasty and delicious.  My dinning partner had the spicy pineapple margarita made with mezcal. Perfecto.  Then we tried the queso fondue. Wonderful with warm tortillas to hold the perfectly spiced queso. A great appetizer. Try the cheese with chips Eid you like a more crunchy experience. And the pollo asada with cucumber salad. Beautifully grilled and a wonderful combination. The place has a wonderful covers outside part of the restaurant which I would highly recommend.,0
"Hubby surprised me with a birthday weekend for the ages! We had dinner with family the night before and he then organized a birthday pizza brunch with our friends at this awesome restaurant. Walking inside was like walking in time to when we were kids hanging out in the Bronx, going to the bodega for quarter waters, grandma cookies and honey buns or a Deli sandwich and a Mystic. It's like a NYC borough time capsule. All the bogedas of yore pretty much had the same look, same items for sale, same pricing and they were all the cornerstones of their respective neighborhoods. It was uncanny, the similarities, and it brought back a nostalgia for me that was comforting. They thought everything, down to the clear plastic display cases with all the 5¢ candies that they have on the wall behind the bar.They hooked us up with a large communal table once everyone arrived. Our server was the bartender as well and she was pretty attentive, despite there being a few other tables dining. All of the pizzas are personal sized which is great for sharing. The Spicy, Margherita, Breakfast and Tres Golpe pizzas were among the crowd faves and we also saw a bodega sandwich made in the front. Everyone loved the food. I even got a birthday Nutella pizza for dessert which had bananas AND strawberries. It was awesome. Deadass.",0
"Pretty ok place.Went to Lido after stopping by Amy Ruth's, where the wait time was a bit long. There's several things to like about Lido, but ultimately nothing terribly unique.Lido looks very much like your typical hipster brunch place. They've got the usual brunch offerings, the bottomless alcohol, the bustling crowd. Decor is nice with several various seating arrangements. You've got your bar tops, high tops, booths, and tables. Seems like there's something for everyone, but if you come with a party, I'd expect to wait a while. Things are pretty close together, so you're the type that likes a bit of real estate, this won't be the place for you. Staff was friendly, even though it was exceptionally busy, and the bathrooms were impressively clean.I wasn't feeling anything fancy for brunch, so I went with the eggs, bacon, and biscuit. It's pretty standard stuff you could make at home, but fancy brunch places always have a way of elevating it. Lido did not elevate it. You'll get a healthy portion of bacon, but the eggs were your standard quick order eggs and were unseasoned. That's not too big a deal since everyone likes a different amount of salt on their eggs. The biscuit was a miss for me, being tough and crumbly. Bacon is bacon, so it's always going to be good, but again, just quick order kitchen stuff. I ordered a latte to go along with the food, which was severed closer to a cappuccino than a latte. I will say though that it tasted great, but not exactly what I ordered.If I lived in the area, I'd for sure go again to see if they do the fancy stuff better, but can't see myself returning.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was not very positive. The service was great, but the food quality wasn't up to par. My boyfriend and I got chicken and fish tacos. The chicken tacos were just ok, but the fish tacos were really disappointing. They were bland and under-seasoned. Overall, I wasn't very happy with the meal. The only thing that made it worth eating were the chips and guac.",1
"Truly underwhelming experience - all hype, no substance. Love soup dumplings, but the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were mediocre at best. Super thick skin (should be thin) and the soup dumplings were jumbo-sized, pretty lazy construction. Staff is efficient, was pleasantly surprised by no wait. Too many other places to recommend - pass.",0
I had a great time at this Thai fusion restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. I would definitely recommend it to others.,1
"Honestly, maybe I went during a bad time or ordered the wrong things, but wasn't really sold on anything special here. Granted I am gluten free and don't eat pork, but typically give in to soy in these circumstances which opens up the menu for me. I had 2 lunch specials one day with my mother and the spicy chicken salad. Loved the red curry with beef, and the pad thai with beef was okay. Spicy chicken salad was nothing special either.  Truthfully I should have known that ordering the lunch special is never the move, and that is universally true, but the pricing was good and we picked a menu from the regular item to pair it with.The restaurant is beautiful and location impeccable. The lighting certainly brings out some outrageously pretty shots of the food and I really liked the designs on the floor and walls. Bathrooms were nice. The service was good, nothing insane. Hostesses in the front were nice and helpful and the waitress, despite broken English, was accommodating. Overall, I'd say 7/10 type place but I think i might have to go back given all of these insane reviews on here. I really only eat Thai food on special occasions and like to really indulge but I think holding back a little might have tampered with my experience. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the Red Curry a great deal just really wish the portion of protein in each of the dishes was for more substantial. I hold true to my belief that I should go back, but am confident enough in my only experience to rate it as such. I don't think my 3 stars will severely impact how this place is viewed anyway just sharing some thoughts. All love",0
"I ordered the Hawaiian classic (Tuna & Salmon) since it had everything I wanted. The serving size was filling for one even though it didn't look like a lot. There wasn't much of the Ponzu sauce spread over the bowl. Mostly concentrated in the middle and the rice was lumped together so it wasn't easy to mix everything either. Only the parts with the ponzu sauce had an Unami flavor.

I filled me up for lunch but don't think I would get again.",1
"I'm a pretty big fan of this place. There are always a bunch of pizza places wherever you go in Manhattan. The issue is that there aren't always a bunch of GOOD pizza places. I'm glad I found this place in a super convenient area! I haven't gotten a chance to try the cannoli yet though, but I will definitely next time. When I visited, I got the mushroom pizza (called the screamer). The crust was super crunchy and good. You can tell that they use quality ingredients, because the pizza isn't super oily. The employees are super nice and friendly. Great service!",0
"The exterior of this restaurant is under renovation, so unfortunately we had to sit out in the cold. The fried calamari was very good, the chicken empanadas were also very good, and the grilled octopus was also a hit. However, I didn't care for the tuna tostada - the fish was a little overcooked for my taste. The service was great, though, and I didn't get food poisoning.",1
"We've been coming here for years, and we always come back to the house special the platters of warm fresh pastas with salad or anti-pasta. This time we were a little disappointed, we got there early and four of us were placed at a very tight table in front of the kitchen door. Previously the selections of pasta included a vegetable topped, cheese filled, & fish Pasta. Tonight's choices were not as special. We enjoyed the spaghetti and tomato sauce, spinach ravioli and pasta Bolognese. We were not wowed with the choices, they were just OK. We missed the pesto sauce, the linguini and clam's pasta.",1
"I came here on a weekend and the venue was pretty packed. I can only imagine what this place would be like on a weekday afternoon. I found my love for Mediterranean food this past year, (thanks, Noon, Cava and Hummus & Pita) so I thought I'd try this place out. I'd recommend ordering the falafel trio platter to get a taste of everything. The platter comes with cabbage (white and red), hummus, olives and tahini to name a few things. Be warned that the platter is suitable for 2 people or 1 really hungry person. No wonder I couldn't finish everything. The platter was flavored wonderfully and went extraordinarily well with the warm pita pocket that was provided. The venue was pretty big and there was ample seating. I especially liked the chickpea table aesthetic and overall, I enjoyed my first experience here. I'd definitely add Nish Nush to my list of Mediterranean go-to spots in the area.",0
"I was disappointed with the lack of beer on tap and the poor whiskey selection. The atmosphere was also quite dated and touristy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, especially if you're looking for a relaxing night out.",1
"I was surprised to see this chain on my list of restaurants to try, as I'm not really familiar with it. The food was decent, but I wasn't blown away. The mojo chicken was moist and had good flavor, and it came with different sides in a bowl type lunch. The veggie plate (spiced carrots, roasted broccolli, mac and cheese, kale salad) was also good, with mac and cheese being creamy and tasting relatively fresh. The only downside was the kale salad, which wasn't very fresh and didn't taste very good. The restaurant wasn't very busy for lunch, so we were able to get in and out quickly. I'm not sure if I would return, but the food was decent overall.",1
"This is a restaurant I would really love to try again. They have a well rounded menu and quite a few options to try out! I wish I had gotten the opportunity to eat at Uncle Boons when it was still around but I am so happy they still maintain some of the dishes here. I tried the Uncle Boons crab fried rice, the roti kaeng fak tong and a thai iced tea. The roti kaeng fak tong was extremely spicy but absolutely delicious. The Uncle Boons crab fried rice was a solid dish, with the addition of the green sauce they include (spicy) it was very good and was a huge portion, but I'm not sure it suited my taste pallet.  I will say, I was thrown off from the Thai Iced tea, it tasted bitter and off compared to what I'm used to drinking. It tasted like medicine. Maybe I just got a bad batch, so I'll try this again next time I pop in. I absolutely love the the aesthetic and ambiance. Even their outdoor (COVID) dining fits in with their vibe. Service was standard. 4/5",0
"I loved the service here! The cashier was super friendly and helpful. The only downside was that the mozzarella sticks were cold and not melted, which was a bit of a disappointment. However, the pizza was delicious and I forgot it was vegan. I would definitely come back for a slice!",1
"*Beware: racism is practiced at this establishment*  0/10 don't recommend this establishment.So I guess because I'm black, I'm not genuinely welcomed here? I came inside in my work clothes and looking online it says that it's open. However, when I went in (at 11:35pm) the male host says they close in 20 minutes. Thinking about it I'm like ""alright well is the kitchen open, he said no"" I called just now at (11:37pm) and whoever answered the phone- it would be hilariously ironic if it was the same host - just said they closed at 2 am. Now... is the kitchen really closed or what? Even so, what if I came for drinks and wanted to blow some steam off. It kind of broke my spirits I won't lie. I didn't expect this in NYC of all places, but anything is possible. I won't say this establishment is racist, but damn sure the people they hire- MALE HOST- are sketchy af. and not a good look. And by the looks of another review this isn't their first instance  where a staff member at this place was being ignorant.Update: Filed a complaint with the NYC Commission on Human Rights..",0
"Got take out for a movie night from here - food was ready to pick up in just 15min! We got the chicken & mushroom, hot and sour, and beef. All there were delicious and devoured immediately and we will definitely be returning customers for the noodle dishes. We also got the pig ear but honestly there were barely any pieces in our container and I could barely taste the spice so pass on that. Overall highly recommend and we will be back!",0
"When people ask me what are my top restaurant's I'd recommend in the city, Wayan holds one of the top spots. I've only been here to dine once, as a friend was in town and we were able to snag a resy for 3 at the last minute and this establishment had been on my wishlist for awhile. Wow, it truly did not disappoint. Let's start with food. The flavor profiles here are so complex and unique. The dishes they serve here are truly unlike anything I've had before. I love fusion places, and this spot only further illuminates that. Here's what we ordered:- Vegetable Spring rolls: comes with two, deliciously crispy and paired with delicate dipping sauce- Ceviche: super refreshing and light- Lobster Noodles: I dream of this dish. This is a MUST order when coming here. The noddles and coated in sauce and there are large chunks of lobster distributed throughout.  A very elegant, well thought out dish.- Pork Rib: a meat-falling-off the bone type of dish. Very tender and very strong taste. This is cooked to perfection. Another must order IMO.- Nasi Goreng: out of everything we ordered this was the least impressive, which is funny because it was still very delicious. I think the flavor was pretty decent and it's nice that there is a fried egg on top, but this is a dish that you could skip. - Corn Fritters: We ordered this simply because everyone online raves about it! It was definitely interesting and worth trying. Not my personal favorite, but I would eat it again if given the chance!- Chocolate Ganache: I was blown away by the avocado ice cream. Super rich and creamy, not overly sweet, literal perfection on a plate. I also really enjoyed the rich chocolate spread. A great way to end the meal. We all enjoyed our cocktails as well.Service was pretty good. Interior is stunning and elegant. A lovely place to get dressed up and to enjoy a food tasting experience. I can't wait to come back and sit at the Chef's counter. 5/5",0
"Came here on a Saturday night for a reservation for two. 886 is located on the part of St. Marks that's like Asia 2.0 - tons of incredible Asian restaurants everywhere so I had high expectations. My friend and I weren't that hungry, so we kept it simple and limited the ordering. We shared the lettuce wraps, which were delicious. It essentially tasted like the inside of a dumpling...on lettuce lol. I ordered the Lo Ba Beng, which was essentially bamboo, egg, cilantro and pork belly on rice. The pork belly was super tender, and the bamboo was tasty. I wish there was a little bit more rice than was served. My friend got the shrimp fried rice and seemed to like it. I think the pricing was fair, service was fair and the overall experience was enjoyable.",0
"The actual menu was slightly different from the pictures on Yelp, but in a good way. I expected to just get the hamburguesa and call it a night; contrary my food adventures in NYC continue.Service: Straightforward & attentive. They didn't bother kissing ass/making prolonged conversation, which I appreciate since it's been a trend here. I like my dining experience like my Wal-Mart experience: get my shit & get out with occasional side-shows.The servers did well with checking in on me, especially with a compact full house indoors and while I was the only one outside.Food:Before I begin, both these dishes did well bringing out all 5-7 tastes.1) Shrimp -- the initial taste of garlic chili sauce already set me on a good mood (This. Is. A. Mu'fuckin' SAUCE) : sweet, salty, garlicky, savoury, ever-so-slightly spicy scrumptiousness covering well-cooked and diced shrimp. The green garnish ( I believe it was cilantro & scallions ) and cucumbers added a cooling contrast and acidity, completing the sauce. The avacado was delightfully more creamy and neutralizing rather than a suffocating avacado flavour. All of this was served with toast elevating the dish further.If I had to summarize this, it'd be toned-down (in lime & tomato) ceviche but way better tenfold2) Duck -- this is the dish I didn't know I needed for November. A great protein alternative to steak; the duck had a juicy and mild gamy umami. The squash topped with nuts and spice brought an crunchy, cinnamon-ey , lightly sweet, earthiness that mellowed out the tanginess of the cranberry worcestershire-like flavoured sauce. Combining a little of everything into one solid bite TASTES like Thanksgiving is around the corner (ironically enough, it is).In all honesty, the names of the dishes are understatements for what they are.Great place to try, especially if you're stay at the MADE hotel.",0
"We stumbled upon The Butcher's Daughter while we were out on Bowery street for shopping. Place looked up beat with some really good items on menu so we decided to stop by for late lunch at around 3pm.Great atmosphere and very welcoming staff on arrival. Food was incredible - huge portions and great value for money. We tried the avocado toast Benedict, The grateful veggie sandwich and some water flower juice which contained fennel, water melon, honey dew, pear, lime, agave and some spices. Good spot to eat vegan food and great service.The whole experience was very enjoyable! Will be returning next time we visit NY!",0
"I visited this restaurant for the first time and was impressed with the speed of service! The food was also decent - I ordered Drunken Noodles with chicken and Pad See Ew with chicken and both were tasty. However, I didn't think the food stood out compared to other Thai restaurants in the area. The portions were also small for the price you pay, and I didn't detect any crab in the rangoons.",1
"Had a good lunch. It wasn't busy at all on a weekday during lunchtime. Our waitress was very friendly. Prices were reasonable, although substitution of any kind costs $3 each. Unfortunately, I can't have shellfish, so I had to make a few substitutions from their sets. I got the Hungry set and substituted the shrimp with toro with scallion and blue crab with ikura salmon. They also ran out of yellowtail, so I got a substitute for spicy scallops.The rundown:Salmon - decent salmonToro scallion - good toro, but not the best I hadIkura Salmon - love this combo of ikura and salmonSpicy scallops - fresh scallops with a good amount of spicy mayo.The rice was nicely seasoned.  Everything tasted fresh. The seaweed layer was not as crispy as I would like. But overall, I think it's a decent option for handrolls. I was pretty full from 4 handrolls. Tips and tax were not included like other handroll spots.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, based on the great reviews. Unfortunately, our waiter was really off-putting and made our evening quite unpleasant. He was very unpleasant to our group, and the drinks took forever to come even though we were the only table in the restaurant. The food was alright, but I wasn't thrilled with the confusing menu or the long wait for our drinks. I don't think I would go back too soon, as there are plenty of other options in the area.",1
"I came here with a friend for Sunday brunch. It was all in all a solid brunch, but I won't come back given that there's a lot more brunch spots I prefer at the same price point.My friend got a croque madam, and I got the avocado toast. My friend seemed to like her croque madam, but the avocado toast was a hard past. The avocado on the avocado toast came sliced instead of mashed like I would have preferred. It also comes with grapefruit and sour cream, which is a little bit of a different ensemble than what I'm used to. It was generally pretty tasteless. The coffee was just okay as well.I really loved the ambiance and decor of the restaurant though! I may be back to try their wine at night, but will not be back for the food.",0
"Link to menu: qrco.de/bbxNEHSadly, my experience here didn't expand my perception of vegan sushi ""beyond"" my expectations. While certainly fresh and visually appealing, both my friend and I found their dishes to lack ""oomph"" in flavor.- Mighty Mushroom Roll: $9: exactly like how you'd expect plain rice, mushrooms, and tofu to taste together. Shiitake truffle sauce was light and unmemorable.- Spicy Mang Roll: $9: an innovative combination with varied textures and cayenne sauce that packed a pat (as opposed to a punch)! Did not quite taste the mango.- Five Spicy Chick'n Dumplings: $9: rather thin; chick'n filling was bland with a texture comparable to tofu. Enjoyed the crunchy chili panko on top but wish the sweet yuzu glaze was more fragrant.It would be lovely if the flavors were upped a notch to match the price point. I've added a star for the ambiance: it is a small, classy space, though stuffy on a hot day. Service was nice and they have a restroom in the back.I'd be willing to return to try their Fried Chick'n Bao and special rolls, but wouldn't put it at the top of my list.",0
"Wow! They enlarged the space in here and turned it from a little quick counter and stool wing spot to a restaurant where you can actually eat-in! They even have 4 TVs throughout; one was playing a Halloween movie, the others were the News, ESPN, and NBC. This is awesome! I was happy that the staff allowed me to taste a variety of their sauce before making a purchase. The INSANE was too hot for me. I got the inferno and smokey-bourbon instead. It was $14.99 for 10 traditional wings. I love the inferno. It was delicious. The smokey-bourbon was sweet and smokey. But the inferno was exciting and addicting and mouth-burning. I wish I ordered more of it. My only complain is I wish I had more wings and less drum sticks. And maybe also that I didn't like their blue cheese, it was too sour. I used my own bottle of Roquefort blue cheese instead. Other reviews said their wings had too much sauce. Guess they've already made the change because mine didn't have enough sauce. Overall, I love the Inferno wings here and I'm already craving for more!-------------------------------------------Update: Came back the next day to order 10 traditional Inferno wings. I asked for wings only, no drumsticks. I got 4 drumsticks. The lady staff  explained that she put in Flat Heavy for me and that means I'm going to get very few drumsticks... I was thinking 2, but 4/10 is almost half of my order! Yesterday I ordered 10 wings and got 2 sauces on the side, today 10 wings gave me 1 sauce on the side somehow. Same restaurant, different experience everyday.",0
"Better than expected, brunch at Better Than Bougie was really good! I didn't think that it would be as good as the HH meal, but it was! Sunday brunch around 2pm was not as crowded, but it was still busy and very family-friendly. The staff were accommodating with a space for the stroller and they even brought a high chair for the baby. All in all, I would recommend it for a boozy brunch with friends. We had a breads basket as appetizer, a burger, Benedicts and Brooklyn blackout cake. Yum! The only downside was the price of the bread basket and the mediocre muffins. But the burger and Benedicts were terrific! The fries were also great. We'll be back!",1
"This restaurant had great potential but unfortunately failed in execution. The staff was not friendly, and the food was not good at all. The tortillas were stale, the food was soggy, and it was not worth the price. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
Maybe closer to 3.5 but rounding up since the service was nice and the food came out pretty fast.I made a quick stop for lunch and was pleased to see they had some outdoor seating available. I only tried the mushroom sloppy. I thought it was good but found myself wanting the flavors to be turned up a notch. The portion is on the slightly smaller side as well.I'm curious to try the rest of the menu but will have to save that for another day.,0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the portions were really large. The service was also okay; not stellar but definitely above average for NYC. The prices are definitely reasonable for the amount of food you get, and I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Ponty Bistro is a hidden gem that I highly recommend! The food is absolutely delicious, and the service is top-notch. The only downside is that it takes a bit for the food to come out, but it's definitely worth the wait. I can't wait to try their dinner menu!",1
"The restaurant is cute and has a great atmosphere. The service was very frequent and kind. The fried shrimp appetizer was okay, but I would probably get something else next time. The kimchi fries at the other location were so good, but I was disappointed that they didn't have them here.",1
"My friend and I shared the dry pot combo - with the spicy level. We got chicken gizzard, sliced round, pork belly, Chinese cabbage, wood ear mushroom, glass noodles, fish egg roe balls, and bamboo shoots. Split between two ppl this was more than enough and the price was nice for its portions. The service was great and they must have known it was a bit spicy for me because they always refilled water fast and I never had an empty glass even though I kept chugging water. So yes I'm good with spice but then again this place is called mala so you gotta get the spicy level. Couldn't do the super spicy level though.Loved it here and would definitely come again!",0
"Not my first choice for rice rolls.Not much filling and they were kind of soggy? I don't know they were just okay. Really wanted to like this place bc I heard such great things, but was disappointed.",0
I had a great experience at this restaurant! The outdoor seating area was a nice touch and it felt more like an actual restaurant experience than some of the bus lane setups I've been to. The servers seemed happy and the food was good. Customer service was great too.,1
"I had really high expectations for this place because I love the noodles at Tsujita, and while the noodles didn't disappoint, the broth did by a huge margin. It was so fatty and sour, and the broth for the tsukemen was more a soup than for dipping. It didn't coat the noodles really, and I didn't get through the bowl. The takoyaki was okay.",0
"Pros The food was absolutely delish!! I see why people rave about Maison Pickle now. I had the hot honey chicken n toast which came out crispy and piping hot. The bread they use for their thick and fluffy french toast is actually so good!! Additionally, the serving size was huge. After eating less than half, I was super full. Even with a party of 11, our food came out really fast. The staff were super friendly and when one of my friends lost their food when it got taken back to the kitchen to get boxed up, they brought out for her an entirely new entree for her to take home, which was such great customer service! For birthdays, they can bring out a slice of 24 layer cake with giant sparklers. I had the red velvet one which was super yummy. Overall, a great experience!ConsThey only take reservations for 12 or more if you do their prix fixe menu, which I preferred not to because a lot of my friends had various dietary restrictions. I actually had a party of 15 total and we had to make two reservations for 4 and 11 separately and the tables weren't close together at all. Also, even with a reservation for 12pm, we were not seated until 12:40pm.",0
A big place for Mexican American. It has the downstairs and then there's a whole big upstairs area. Rosa Mexicano specializes in big stuff. Has frozen Margaritas. There's also the typical Americanized Mexican stuff like the burritos and fajitas among other things. I like getting the frozen Margarita. It's $12.50 for the regular size. This is very big even for just this. A popular flavor is the pomegranate. This has a bit of sweetness and tartness. A bad thing is they charge for chips and salsa. It's about $4 for this. Thankfully the salsa is high quality and not like the canned shit you get usually. Entrees are pricey. This isn't fast food shit. Has a pretty cool atmosphere. It has an upstairs area and up the stairs there's cascading water with lots of tiny diver statues sticking out. The drinks and food are overpriced but not a whole lot like some places and they have fast service as well.,0
"Gem Bing Shop is a great place to get a jianbing - a crispy crepe sandwich filled with thin layer of egg, a crunchy wafer, lettuce + (any additional fillings like spam, duck, more egg, pork, etc.  for an added cost). I ordered the regular-sized jianbing ($8.99) with an add-on filling of crispy duck (+$3.99). My jianbing was made in front of me and took about 7-10 minutes. It was boxed and bagged neatly.

The jianbing was pretty good - nice amount of crunch, decent amounts of savory duck along with the crisp lettuce and egg. The mix of textures and flavors make for an interesting bite. I wasn't sure what to expect and I pretty much liked what I got. The price feels high, but the duck jianbing is basically a snack and runs about $12.98 + tax + tip. You can get a smaller size jianbing which is a couple dollars less. Overall, it's worth a try if you have never had one. The service is pretty curt, outside of ordering.",1
"I had a great experience at Sant Ambroeus! The food was authentic Milanese cuisine, and the bartender Alex was incredible with his knowledge of wine. The service was fast and nonintrusive. I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro, and it was delicious and fresh. The only downside was that it was a little chilly for outdoor seating, but I would definitely take advantage of the opportunity if it were available. Overall, a great experience!",1
"Came to Up Thai with a friend on a weekday to grab lunch! The ambiance of the restaurant was great and I really liked the pretty lanterns hung up for decoration. We both decided to get one of the lunch specials, which came with salad or soup, a separate small appetizer, and entree. My friend got the soup, dumplings for the app, and Pad Khing entree, which she said was very flavorful. I recently started eating gluten-free and opted for the salad without any dressing, gave my dumpling appetizer to my friend since they didn't seem to have any gf options, and the classic pad thai for entree. The pad thai was good but didn't really stand out to me. We were both so impressed with the portions that we got for lunch - they were honestly so large and there were plenty of leftovers to take home. I was kind bummed because I ended up finding a completely rotten lettuce leaf in my salad that made me a lot less inclined to finish the rest of it. Overall, I think it's definitely a great place for an affordable lunch, though I wish there were fresher ingredients in our food the day we went and that there were a few more gf-friendly options.",0
"DB Bistro Moderne is a great place to get a unique burger. The Sirloin Burger is stuffed with braised short rib, foie gras, and black truffle, and is served on a Parmesan bun with fries. It's a bit pricey at $35, but it's definitely worth it if you're looking for something special. The service is also great, and the restaurant is generally pretty empty so you can enjoy your meal without any delays.",1
"I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could, because it's just affordable and satisfactory enough to be better than a 3, but not really remarkable to warrant a 4. Ultimately, I think a 4 is a kinder, more accurate rating than a 3 is.The sushi roll (spicy Maki Combo) was a bit ordinary, and we have had much better, but at the same, it is absolutely value for money, as is the bento box. The bento box featured California rolls that disintegrated easily, but nonetheless they were satisfactory. I liked the salmon teriyaki and the shumai. The beef Udon has some nice beef slices, and makes for a filling dish.",0
"Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food, and great service! And great presentation with every item we ordered. The Octopus was too pretty to eat. The sushi rolls were good too. The braised Short Rib was bug but delicious. And the Chupa Cabra drink was deliciousss! They put goat cheese and cilantro in a drink that is surprisingly well balanced. Everything here was aesthetically pleasing yet so delicious. It was such a treat and a wonderful experience. Definitely coming back!",0
"Everything is great here!The staff, food, and ambiance are warm and inviting. My friend hates tacos but recommended this place because it converted her. She comes here several times a week now lol. Theres also outside seating with heat lamps which is very covid friendly:)",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The value was great, and they always give out free meals on birthdays. It's always a lot of fun to go out with friends here.",1
"Lokal 83 Mediterranean Kitchen is a great restaurant for diners to make their post-pandemic debut. The service was impeccable, and the food was delicious. The bill for three entrees and a large bottle of Pellegrino totaled 106$ + 20$ tip. My only complaint is that we really ended up with a full entree to take home with us. My mother kept saying that two entrees would be enough, but we rarely if ever listen to her lol (really not funny, maybe even a bit mean, no ... definitely mean).",1
"As Friedman's continues to expand with more location across Manhattan in recent years, this location remains the most accessible given the location in Herald Square and spaciousness (except during weekend brunch). The selling point is of course the mere fact that most of the items on the menu is gluten-free. It is quite the accomplishment to make a GF waffle taste decent! Most visitors from outside the US that I have taken to Friedman's really appreciated a healthier brunch option. And this is exactly what they want. Though, if there is one thing that could be improved ever-so-slightly, it would be the coffee and cappuccinos. Both of which tastes a bit watered down and diluted during the last visit. Lastly, the staff is very friendly and attentive so a big thanks for their hospitality.",0
The Smith's brunch was excellent! The shrimp and grits were a perfect comfort food for a Sunday morning and the chicken sandwich was delicious. The Jalapeno Grits were a great side and the bacon added a nice touch. The cocktails were cutely packed in jam jars and were perfect for sipping on the patio. We would definitely recommend this brunch spot to friends and hope to visit again soon!,1
"El Centro is a great spot for Mexican food. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. My friend who doesn't usually enjoy tacos really enjoyed their experience here, and now she comes here frequently. The restaurant also has outdoor seating with heat lamps, which is perfect for those chilly nights.",1
"Came here with a group of vegetarian friends after seeing Buzzfeed's ""Worth It."" I had also gone to Avant Garden, and liked both of these restaurants for different reasons.It was (rightfully) crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but we were able to get a reservation and were seated after about a 10 minute wait.The whole atmosphere here is really great. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and the other staff was really friendly to us. We each got a mixture of things, but my favorite was the macaroni and ""cheese"". It was really flavorful and had a good consistency, unlike some of the other cashew cheeses that I have had, that are more grainy. My friends tried the Po' Boy with  crawfish"" and ""shrimp"" (and the consensus was that the ""shrimp"" version was better).Overall, would recommend for a vegetarian dinner option. Bonus points if you go to Levain on 116th and Frederick Douglass (10 minute walk) afterwards!",0
"A reliable Italian restaurant with a classic menu and a cosy interior.I went to Felice with a friend and overall, found the experience to be a good one.We ordered the Arancini and bruschetta to start. I personally preferred the Arancini balls, the bruschetta was piled up high with tomatoes that were relatively flavorless.For the entree I had the Arrabiata sauce with Pappardelle pasta instead of spaghetti. The pasta was a good size with the Pappardelle cooked to perfection however I couldn't help but notice the tomato sauce had a slight tin-like taste which I imagine was because they weren't fresh tomatoes.For dessert I had the apple crumble, which was sweet and delicious.Service was decent, not overly attentive. Courses were brought in a timely fashion.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was decent, but the service was really slow and crowded. The ramen was good, but not great. The portions were small, and the broth was not deep and rich. The pork buns were great, though. The curry flower was delicious, and the tofu was also pretty good. Overall, I would say the apps stole the show, and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"This doesn't seem like a place that would be sneakily, addictively delicious. Chicken over rice... that's pretty simple? Yeah but it's so good! I personally prefer the roasted chicken. The rice is SO TASTY it's weird. The daikon soup is actually my favorite thing on the menu, and it comes with the chicken which is perfect! I was pretty sure ME Chicken wouldn't live up to the hype, but I was being a hater; it definitely did.For what it is, it knocks it out of the park. 5 stars. Oh and the staff is super nice too.",0
"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the great ratings, but I was sadly disappointed. The meat lacked flavor and the portion was skimpy. I would not recommend this place. There are much better options out there.",1
UND has been a great addition to the neighborhood! They recently started serving lunch and the menu options all look delicious! I ordered the Caprese sandwich with Prosciutto which was excellent. I would definitely order it again. They have a good outdoor seating setup in addition to their indoor dining. UND is the perfect spot to enjoy lunch outside on a beautiful day. Highly recommend checking out UND for lunch.,0
"Grabbed dinner with a friend here at La Savane. Even though it's in my neighborhood i wasn't familiar with it (it's super low key). The place itself is not very big and can probably accommodate ~20 people at a time. The servers were attentive and served us quickly. I decided to go for the fish, white rice and side of plantations. The portions were pretty large (i wasn't able to finish it all). The fish was well seasoned and cooked well. I like the sauce that accompanied it. The fish also came with a fish soup that was really good. Plantains were good they cut them up in smaller pieces than I'm used to but cooked wellOverall a cool spot that i will keep on my radar for future dinner spots",0
"We had the Sicilian mushroom slice, two each.  A square slice is around six bucks.  They were pretty good--cheesy and flavorful, though the crust was a little dark for my taste.A little pricey, but this pizza is tasty, and they have some creative dishes I would like to try.  Some examples:  hot boi (jalapeños, mike's hot honey, beef pepperoni), DJ Clark Kent (Italian chicken sausage, fresh garlic).  They also have grandma slices, Margherita, cheese, classic pepperoni and Sicilian.  Ingredients seem fresh.  Our slices were hot.Indoor dining seems hit or miss.So far my faves in NYC are Best Pizza and Roberta's, but I want to try Scarr's again.  And it's a black owned business, so it's a win whenever you support it!",0
"Bad service ok food, not likely to come back. Came here with a group of 8 on a Monday night with a reservation. They required credit card for the reservation. Tip is already included for big parties! Waiter was rude, probably because it was guaranteed tip. It was also hard to get his attention all evening.We shared 4 pizzas, 2 apps, pasta and 2 salads. (he made us order 4 instead of 3 because he said there was $20 minimum per person) but we ended up with an entire one left over.Parpadelle with truffle oil and mushroom was overly oily and bland. Pizza was pretty decent, especially the one with sausage. The calamari wasn't fried that well. The salads were probably the highlights.",0
"Cookshop is a Chelsea institution, and for good reason. The food is always good and the atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable. It can be quite crowded, but the wait is always worth it. The other Cookshop restaurants, Shuka and Vic's, are also excellent. All of them offer creative and delicious food, but Cookshop is the classic that everyone should try at least once.",1
I had a great time at Ugly Kitchen! The staff was friendly and the food was great. I especially loved the Spam fries. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.,1
"I finally stopped by this location after being disappointed with the other two. I'm so glad I did! The food is now great, and the service is as well. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
We went here tonight for a quick dinner.Food: The food was not great. The only thing I enjoyed was the truffle fries. They were crunchy and well seasoned. The Penne Vodka pasta was bland and very under seasoned but it also smelled a little bit like something was burnt or maybe it was a smokey smell. Either way food was very disappointing. Service: Great and on point. Our server checked in on us consistently and was always available when we needed her. Ambiance: They have cute outdoor seating that also has heaters so on days when it's in the mid to high 60's it's nice to sit outside.,0
"this really is an underrated ramen shop. maybe its more busy during lunch but we went on a friday night and we were the only other party dining there. Tonkotsu is DELICIOUS. Umami rich broth without being too heavy with plenty of noodles. The bow spicy ramen was good too, it's got a kick with thick pork belly slices. Kara-age had a hint of sichuan tingly pepper and the mayo to dip it in was deliciously sesame. Curry beef on top of rice came out in like 4 minutes and was devoured immediately. thoughtful coat hooks are placed throughout the restaurant. no restrooms here but you'll be in and out really quick.Open kitchen where the workers look like family. Really sweet place and extremely fair prices for manhattan. come check this place out!",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good at Jaiya, but I was disappointed in the portion sizes. The prices are also a bit high for what you get, especially given that white rice is not included in the price. I don't think I will be returning any time soon, as there are many other great Thai restaurants in the city that I would rather try out.",1
"Highly disappointed! I thought Madame Vo would be the pho place that tops every other place in NYC. I guess not as I ordered the Madame Pho which was a disappointment at $18. It was like California Pho which was better than other pho places in NYC, but still not justifying the price increase other than location. It's a place that tries very hard to be trendy and cool which is fine hence the music and the atmosphere, but I would prefer for the food quality to match that level of price. The Vietnamese Coffee ($5) on the other hand was very good and strong yet steady for the price. I would come back only if other friends wanted to come as I am not a fan of paying too much for feeling disappointed. The service was fair though!",0
"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant, but unfortunately, I was really let down. The Onion Rings used to be some of the best I've ever had, but now they're nothing to write home about. The premade frozen breaded crap is really terrible, and I can't believe they've gone from having the best onion rings in the world to this. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and I'm really sorry I ever bothered trying it out.",1
"To be completely honest I've been going to The Bread Factory Cafe for years for a quick lunchtime grab, but the only thing I've ever purchased from them is pizza. They have a huge assortment of meals to purchase, but the pizza really stood out and continues to stand out for me. The bread itself has a great taste and is never over baked or stale which is something I've experienced from other eateries in the area.The food is cheap and service is quick, just don't expect anything fancy.",0
"Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. The desserts were all delicious and definitely Instagram-worthy, and the service was great. However, we were a bit disappointed with the cookie camp and the boba. The cookies felt soft in the bag and the taro matcha Sunday special was our favorite of the bunch.",1
"First time experience was positive and has me waiting to return.  Ended up going here for V-day and they had a preset three course menu where you got to select an item from each section.  Probably should have taken a picture of the menu as I don't recall everything we had.  I recall the crab cake, seafood paella and apple tart....there was another set and I just remember the dessert.  It was a caramel flan type of consistency with a delicious blueberry sauce.  It was very, very sweet.  Our server Da'Vante (sorry if spelled wrong) was a pleasure to meet and be able to experience.  He was very informative and offered without asking to take a picture of us vs a selfie.",0
"I was excited to try Mercado Little Spain, but I was disappointed. There are a few options to eat here, but nothing that really looks good. The paella station was my favorite part, but the ham was bland and the potatoes were overcooked. The pastries were good, though. Overall, it's not worth going to this place, especially with the other options Hudson Yards has to offer.",1
"I was really disappointed with our meal at this restaurant. The food was weird and not very clean. There weren't any safety precautions in place, so I had no idea what I was eating. The potato salad was the only thing that was good.",1
"I visited this location for a quick bite and was very impressed! The gelato was great quality, and the presentation was top-notch. The service was attentive and individualized, despite being very busy. I love the vegan options here - the chocolate sorbets are my favorite. All of the fruit flavors were great, but it can get a bit sweet after a while. Overall, a great spot for a quick gelato fix!",1
I love ramen and I love that the noodles here are slightly different than the noodles at other ramen joints. The noodles here are a bit thicker which I really enjoy with the thick broth they serve. I got the eak ramen which I really liked. Also got the asian fries which were delicious with the mentai dipping sauce. Would also recommend the berry soju drink. Service was a bit slow but the food made up for it.,0
"I'm so happy that I finally got to try Ichiran. It is the definitive Tonkotsu Ramen experience. You know it's going to be good when it's the only thing on the darn menu!I love the concept of individual booths  and super fast ordering. After marking down your own customized bowl of ramen, a server brings the piping hot, rectangular bowl to you with a lid. I'm not sure if it's the lid or the bowl itself, but I would say this bowl maintained perfect ramen temperature throughout my meal. I can't say that about any other ramen spot I've been to.Immediately you taste perfection in the noodles and broth. The chashu wasn't anything to get excited about. You're literally here for the noodles and broth. The broth combined with the original spicy red sauce provided so much umami and depth of flavor. I love that you can even choose the noodle texture. I went with the recommended medium so that it would not be too firm or too soft. It was the perfect balance of chewy, but soft enough to absorb the broth with every bite. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to judge it based on the original bowl by itself without additional toppings. It did not disappoint and was worth every penny. You can taste the passion and quality in every bite. I will definitely return to try with the additional toppings such as a soft boiled egg, mushrooms, etc. If you love Tonkotsu Ramen, this is a must try spot!",0
"I had a lovely experience at Little Italy restaurant. The prices are reasonable, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. My side salad was fresh and flavorful, the pasta dish was cooked perfectly and had a good portion, and the house bread was fluffy and delicious. The only complaints I have are that the service was a bit rough around the edges, and that the restaurant is a bit small. However, I would happily return to Little Italy and recommend it to others.",1
"Was looking for a place to eat nearby around 2AM after arriving in NY and came across this place on Yelp. I was surprised to see it was poppin! Almost all the tables were taken and there was a long line for takeout. My hubs and I shared 5 empanadas and these were our favorites in order:#1 VIGARA wheat flour - so unique and we've never tried seafood empanadas like this before. They give healthy portions of shrimp and crab meat (I was expecting tiny mashed pieces). #2 GROUND BEEF corn flour - the corn flour is what made this one SO good. They pack in a ton of beef and it's super filling! #3 CHEESESTEAK wheat flour - i love my cheese and steak. Pretty good but nothing spectacular. #4 SPICY CHICKEN wheat flour - good, but nothing unique#5 GREEK SPINACH PIE baked - we got this one on recommendation and can't say we loved it but it wasn't bad. I typically love a creamy spinach but this one just didn't do the trick. Could do without.Will definitely get #1 and #2 again, but forgo the others and try some other items.Tip: If you're looking to dine in, go towards the bar and someone will seat you at additional tables on the other side of the wall. Don't be like me and stand in the entire takeout line before realizing there were more tables on the other side.",0
"I would recommend this place for a drink if they sorted out their cooling situation. After work drinks with colleagues can be a lot of fun here, as they have a good selection of beer and bar bites. I love the giant benches and tables, as I hate standing around in bars. Unfortunately, they either don't have or choose not to use air conditioning indoors, which can make it a little hot. The indoor space was pretty empty, so it's likely that other people felt the same way. Otherwise, the place is fine. The staff costumes are a little cheesy but it's just silly fun that helps it stand out a little bit more.",1
"Very good but also very expensive. My boyfriend and I ordered for pickup this past weekend. We possibly over-ordered slightly: we decided to split the 16oz Chicago cut (about $70), the elote corn ($16), the garlic mashed potatoes ($14), and.....here's where we over ordered, the French dip au jus ($36). This was possibly the most expensive steakhouse I've ever tried being that i normally don't find them worth it - it's pretty hard to mess up a steak - but I have friends that love this place so we figured we'd give it a try. Plus, it's normally a nightmare to get a reservation so the ease of access was huge.The steak was...unbelievable. I found it just the tiniest bit too fatty on the edges for my liking and had to cut some pieces off, but what I ate was unreal. So tender, cooked perfectly, and massive. They gave us some seasoned salt and horseradish sauce to go along with it which was a nice complement without being overpowering. Believe it or not, at $70, the steak was probably the best value of the meal. The French dip was great but not the star. However, at a lower price point it's an affordable dinner for one and I'd consider ordering again by myself. They gave us more than enough jus for dipping.Lastly, in my humble opinion, skip the sides. Were they good? Yeah, sure. Is it ever worth it to pay $16 for a relatively small container of corn? Not really. All in all, if I had to do it again, I'd probably just get the steak and split with someone and make the sides at home. The full meal was around $170 for two. Annoyingly, they also charge 18% gratuity even for pickup. In these circumstances I'm happy to call it a donation, but normally I'm not throwing more than a few dollars tip down for pickup.",0
"I live near Spicy Moon and often see many people waiting to enter this restaurant. I decided to ordered pick-up from here when I was craving dan dan noodles a few weeks ago. I got the lunch special dan dan noodles which came with a side of dumplings. The dan dan noodles were good - better when I added some Chinese black vinegar to them though to balance out the sauce. The dumplings were some of the most unpleasant that I've ever eaten. I've had vegetarian dumplings before but I really did not care for these and ended up throwing them out after the first one. I definitely would order the dan dan noodles again just because of proximity, but would not order or recommend the dumplings. This is definitely a good option for vegetarians/vegans - no wonder it is such a popular place.",0
"I had a nice lunch with some friends here on a Saturday. In order to make a reservation we had to put a $20 deposit fee per person in the reservation. That money is then put towards your bill on the date of your reservation.  I wish the weather was a bit warmer because it is all outdoor and on the water so a little chilly. There is a pretty small food and drink selection which was disappointing. And most options were only seafood, there's 1 burger option on the menu with meat. I really liked the oysters I had and also enjoyed the lobster Mac n cheese, some of the best I ever had!!!! The octopus portion was disappointing, very small. The wait staff was nice and didn't rush us off the table which I appreciated. I'll be back when the weather warms up.",0
"I've wanted to try the food from this restaurant for a while. This restaurant serves Uyghur (a Turkic ethnic group in China) food which is also halal. Be aware that there isn't a restroom, but Macy's, Bryant Park and Whole Foods is not too far away. We had the meat buns, big plate of chicken, and laghman. The buns are made fresh and comes out piping hot. Very good. The bun is crispy with the bottom a bit caramelized. The meat was flavorful and gave the bun a bit of juice. I enjoyed the laghman. The noodles are terrifically chewy and fresh. I wasn't a fan of the taste of the big plate of chicken though. The chicken was a bit bland. It comes with fresh flat noodles on the side which you mix in.",0
"7.2/10Cheese slice: very cheesy, in a good way; cheese could be better, but it is cooked well; not super floppy, but could definitely be crispier and more firm; decent crust; biggest issue is the sauce, felt a bit cheap, doesn't taste like it was made in-house",0
"The food was so fresh and tasty. We had the oyster appetizer, which is a seasonal dish so they don't always have it. It was very very good and the box we had was made with quality ingredients. Yes, it is a little on the expensive side but the quality doesn't disappoint! Dessert was alright. Nothing compare to the box!",0
I tried out a new vegan/vegetarian Chinese restaurant this week and I was really impressed! The rice rolls came with veggie meat and shrimp dumplings. Both were delicious and very filling. The prices are very reasonable and I was able to get a good amount of food for under $10. The service was great - they gave us a beeper so we could easily tell them when we wanted service or to pay our bill. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal at a great price.,1
"I recently had the misfortune of trying the avocado toast at this restaurant and it was an absolute travesty. For the price of $25, I expected something much better than the frozen bread and hacked avocado that I received. It felt like a slap in the face, and I was truly insulted. I'm only giving it more than one star because of the extensive therapy I have had to forgive those who have hurt me. I will pray for the restaurant that they can do better than this. Senza gluten.",1
"This place is so fun to hang out on a cool, Autumn evening after work!The design is very open and airy, with an expansive outdoor patio area and elevated narrow deck that flows effortlessly into the bar ( kudos to the architect!), definitely inviting!I attended for a company event and the management and wait staff were impeccable! Extremely accommodating, attentive, patient and friendly is how I'd describe this great team. The drink menu is AMAZING! I highly recommend the Blood Orange Martini, I found  practically myself two-handing these they were THAT good! The passed hors d'oeuvres were absolutely deeeelish!! Rosemary fries, cheeseburger sliders with really delicious meat, chicken skewers that tasted organic and fried cucumber ball with fresh tzatziki sauce all received rave reviews from our group. I can't wait to come back here! The energy was inviting, lively, and just right for any occasion.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The service was impeccable and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about all of the dishes. The food was also great - there was good variety on the menu and the prices were very reasonable. I especially loved the curry here - it was definitely the star of the show! The only downside was that the portions were a bit small, so for 2 people at lunch, we ended up ordering 6 dishes total (3 of the pick 2s). but the total was still pretty reasonable given the area.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant - you won't regret dining here!",1
"We came here for lunch during a very hot day. All the other nearby restaurants didn't have AC on so, we settled to eat here.  The restaurant was packed and we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. We sat in the back near the bathroom and kitchen. If I were to visit this restaurant again, I wouldn't sit in this same spot again because it had a weird smell that dampened my experience here. Also, I would avoid using their hand sanitizer. It was sticky and a strong chemical smell. I ordered shrimp fried rice ($9) and it was tasty. I feel like its really hard to mess up fried rice which is why I always order it when I am starving.  I added some hot sauce to spice up the dish. Farabe has been here several times and usually gets the grilled shrimp on rice vermicelli ($10). They love how well done and charred the shrimps are and the homemade sauce. They finished every single drop in the bowl and wished they had more. One thing, I didn't like was that I wanted to order a banh-mi in addition to my rice but, was told that they use wing and leg meat in their sandwiches. Personally, I find meat in those part of the chicken to be disgusting and I was disappointed because I prefer chicken breast instead. This is was the first time I was ever heard of a restaurant using that kind of meat for sandwiches. The staff was okay as they took our order and left us to our own devices. I would visit again if I am in the area and craving comfort food at affordable prices.",0
"Tony's Di Napoli is a great place to go for a delicious Italian meal. The portions are really big, so make sure you're hungry before coming! The penne vodka and chicken parmigiana are their most popular dishes, and they were both really good. The staff is also really friendly and welcoming, which is great. I definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Grabbed lunch here yesterday because I found a great deal via Ritual. Pickup was easy and seamless. I ordered a Chicken Biryani and boy it was soooo tasty. Huge chunks of juicy chicken and portion size was generous. I saved half of it for another lunch this week. I requested mild spice, but appreciated that there was still a little kick to it (I prefer some spice than none at all, especially with Indian food!) and that they packed a side of raita (white sauce). So delicious.",0
"Stopped by after dinner this past weekend for drinks. We came on a Saturday around 6pm and there were a few tables available. The Russian Vodka Room is pretty dark but it's lit up by fairy lights at the bar. We got the Lindsay Lohan and the Fickle Blueberry cocktails. The Lindsay Lohan had sparkling wine, blackberry purée, St. Germain, and mint. It was sweet, which is exactly the type of drink I like! The Fickle Blueberry tasted a lot stronger and it'd be a good choice if you liked blueberries. Seemed like a lot of people ordered food too. We weren't hungry, but would like to check out the food here next time.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was great and the service was friendly and accommodating. I loved sitting outside on the street and the short staffing wasn't a problem at all. The only downside was that I didn't get to try all of their dishes, but I'm definitely interested in returning!",1
"I was really disappointed with my visit to this restaurant. The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best. The martini I ordered was in a small glass and cost $14, which was way too expensive. Additionally, the music charge downstairs that was not posted anywhere until the check came was quite steep at $10. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"The food at this steakhouse wasn't bad, but it was definitely overpriced. The salad was good, but the real standout dish was the lobster tail. It was cooked very well and was definitely worth the price. However, the steak itself was a bit on the bland side, and the price was a bit too high for what you got. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a decent meal but don't want to break the bank.",1
"I stopped in toscana 49 for an early dinner/late lunch and the restaurant was pretty busy for 5pm on a Saturday. The waiter brought out bread and marinara sauce, but the bread was soggy. The marinara sauce was very oily and had a strange taste to it. I didn't like it very much at all. I ordered the melon and prosciutto as an app, but the melon was a bit hard and the prosciutto was flat on the plate underneath the melon and there wasn't very many pieces of melon which was a bit odd. For dinner, I had the veal piccata which was excellent however it was served with asparagus which could have been cooked a bit longer. The veal was tender and the piccata sauce was delicious. Despite my best efforts not to, I ordered the chocolate mousse cake for dessert and it was delicious. I'm mad at myself for eating so much.",1
I'm surprised this rating isn't higher. This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the UES for a fast take out. Their chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce is delicious and consistent. Not to mention the owners are very nice and friendly. I'm so sad I moved away from them and highly recommend!!,0
"I love Sant Ambroeus! It's authentic Milanese cuisine- and by that do I mean authentic! The caprese sent me straight back to Italy, with how fluffy, rich, and delicious it is. The bartender Alex is incredible, his knowledge of wine is never ending and will help you choose the perfect bottle for your consumption. The service is fast and nonintrusive. I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro which was delicious and fresh. It was a little chilly for outdoor seating but i would Definetley take Advantadge if it were available. Thank you Sant Ambroeus for an amazing dinner, can't wait to be back for brunch!",0
"We came here for brunch indoor dining. They take your temperature and have hand sanitizer at every table. They use QR code menus. This restaurant is pretty large with spacious booths and they have some plastic walls in between tables which I appreciated. We ordered the crispy artichokes which were great. The lemon aioli sauce that it comes with is fantastic; very citrusy and tangy. we got a small side cup of it to have with our mains because it was so good. The artichokes are yummy as well. Very buttery and flaky. They melt in your mouth. For entrees, we had the huevos rancheros and the southern seitan sandwich. The sandwich was amazing. The seitan was crispy and had a great texture. The sauce was flavorful and the focaccia bread was buttery and fresh. It was also large and very filling. I didn't like the huevos rancheros very much. they do a good job of recreating the ""egg"" texture with tofu but the dish was cold and lacked flavor and spice. But the staff was super friendly and nice and service was great. I would come back!",0
"I'm so glad we stumbled upon this Dominican restaurant near our hotel on our last day in NY. The Mangu was a great way to start the day - it was delicious, filling, and not too heavy. We'll definitely be back next time we visit NY and would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good breakfast option.",1
"Why, exactly, has it taken me so long to get here? I live five blocks away for Pete's sake! And the irony is that i came here simply for brevity sake: their lines weren't long. I won't make that mistake again. This gelato was hot damn terrific! A bit pricey, but honestly...you can taste the priciness in the gelato. Good quality stuff. I had the blueberry cheesecake gelato, Husbo had the raspberry. You can get more than one flavor in a cup. I'd suggest the classic size cup if you want to try more than one. So many other flavors I need to try. And quality shows in the staff as well - they make designs with the cones that are pretty stellar! I can't wait for my next trip. And pro tip: you order your size first, then hand your ticket to the gelato pro!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The hand rolls here are definitely the best I've had in the city, and the price is reasonable. The service is always quick, and they give you a menu with a pencil so you can check off the option of hand rolls you want. Everything was delicious! I could always add on more handrolls if I wanted. There's not many options for apps at this restaurant, but all the seats are on the sushi bar so it's perfect if you're looking for a place to sit and enjoy your meal. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"Cathedrale is a French-Mediterranean concept restaurant by Tao Group (owners of Tao, Beauty & Essex, Vandal, Lavo, etc.). I made reservations for my fiancé's birthday here and it was simply perfect. Great spot for a special occasion celebration or night out with the girls with your cutest outfit. The venue is gorgeous with high ceiling and a beautiful chandelier in the middle of the dining room. They have both indoor and outdoor seating (on the street). Indoor dining in the main dining room and additional seating can be found in the garden patio. We sat in the main dining room in a booth - perfect for a romantic night. As beautiful as the venue is, the employees are even better. The service was top notch. The server checked in numerous times and made sure we were having a grand time. They also cleaned the table several times as we were finishing up between dishes. Moving on to the food. We ordered the steak tartare ($19), ribeye ($79), truffle fettuccine ($45) and the spiced apple beignets. They were all incredible. The truffle fettuccine was very filling and was a bit salty (the good cheesy salty though).  The steak was cooked to perfection. The Apple beignets were delightful - fantastic fall desert to top off the night.We also ordered 2 drinks (Lemmy Caution and San Simon). Lemmy caution is great for all the old fashion lovers - it is whisky based with tobacco nectar and orange bitters. Fiancé loved pairing it with his steak. The San Simon is great for all the spicy lovers. It is a tequila based drink with pomegranate, hibiscus and habanero shrub. I enjoyed the complex flavors very much. This place is pretty epic - I highly recommend you bump this one up on your list of places to go!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The waitstaff was super polite and attentive, and they didn't mind our group staying there for more than an hour or two. The food was great, and there were a lot of vegetarian selections. I would definitely go back!",1
"Great cafe in a bustling area. Coffee and pastries are a must have! I came here multiple mornings over the course of a week and trying different breakfast items. My favorites are their fresh croissants and coffee. I also had a salmon bagel sandwich (very filling) and a plain bagel with cream cheese. The bagels here were not my favorite. They didn't taste as fresh as they could be. The service was always friendly and efficient. Overall, it's a great place to grab a coffee and a pastry to go in the mornings!",0
"The pizza here is pretty cheesy and very saucy. The crust is a bit thicker than most pizzas, but we liked it! They are supposed to be personal sized, but they are pretty big and enough for 2 people with appetizers. I recommend the meatballs to start and the Buffalo caprese salad.",1
"Was here for drinks on a rainy night with a large group on friends. We did not have any food and stayed at the bar so I cannot attest to their dining experience. The first thing I was disappointed with was no beer on tap, just bottled/canned beer with limited variety. Secondly I did not enjoy the whiskey and coke or whiskey and ginger I had because it was far too strong and whatever whiskey was used was bottom shelf.The overall feel of this restaurant and bar is tourist trap kitschy haunted house. That is the theme so I don't have anything really negative to say other than it feels dated and there were a lot of children here I was not expecting to see. Would not recommend  bring a child less than 10 years old here. They had some sort of haunted tour upstairs they kept bringing family groups up to while telling them the rules and not to touch anything. I probably won't be coming back unless I want to show someone a strange pocket of Manhattan nightlife.",0
"I had a great experience at STK Midtown! The decor and DJ were great, and the service was prompt and attentive. I started with the sea bass ceviche, which was well prepared and delicious. For dinner, I had the sea bass with bok choy and the beef short ribs with a Mac and cheese side. The miso glaze on the sea bass was a great complement and the short ribs were very tender. I would recommend skipping the Mac and cheese, as it was dry and overcooked, but the chocolate moose crunch dessert was fantastic. I'd definitely visit again and say they're worth a try.",1
I had a really disappointing experience at this restaurant. The XLB (soup dumplings) were incredibly doughy and difficult to eat. The wrappers were very odd and didn't seem to be made well. The inside of the dumplings was very sweet and I wasn't able to taste anything else besides sugar. The price was a bit high for what we got. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.,1
"The food was good, but I was a bit disappointed in the hype. I'm looking forward to going back when they reopen and giving them a true shot.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The window decor was interesting and the menu had lots of options that I wasn't aware of. The staff was really friendly and accommodating, and the food was really good. I especially loved the toro handrolls and the sake. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great sushi experience.",1
"I came here with some friends late afternoon on a Sunday. Had a little bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad - probably waited 20 minutes to be seated for 5 people. We shared an order of the chicken tatsuta-age appetizer. This Japanese fried chicken was so good! It was crispy but not too oily and the chicken was really good. I got the seasonal udon, which was little neck clams in a light and aromatic broth. It was delicious! The clams were fresh and the udon was nice and chewy. It was really refreshing! I also tried my friend's chicken curry udon. It was warm and hearty, great for a rainy day. Chicken was tender and the curry broth wasn't too heavy or salty. Overall, the food was great and I would highly recommend. Service was also very good - servers were attentive and came over to ask how we liked the food. Everything we ordered came out in a timely manner.",0
"This restaurant is great for dinner if you're looking for a delicious meal and some good wine. The only problem is the service, which can be slow at times.",1
"August Gatherings is a great place to go if you're looking for a casual, elevated Chinatown meal. The menu has all the trendy ingredients of haute cuisine, but the prices reflect that. The duck was cooked well and the black garlic was a nice addition. However, the dish was overly salty and the okra was a bit bland. The waiters were attentive and kept coming to refill our tea.",1
"I was really surprised by how good the food here was for such a low price. I got a plate of crispy pork and it was so delicious. The pork was fatty but still had that insanely delicious crispy skin. I also got half char siu which balanced perfectly. The only downside is that it can be a bit of a wait in the line, but it's worth it for the quality of the food. I would definitely come back here.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant last month and unfortunately their monthly special wasn't the donut collaboration one. However, their everything bagel chicken nuggets with jalapeño cream cheese dip were still really good. The nacho Mac and cheese was absolutely incredible- I definitely recommend it! I'm definitely going to be back to try some other flavors and maybe even some yummy drinks.",1
"pretty good vegetarian place, loved all the dishes we ordered. the wait is long though on a Saturday night, it'd be good to get a number and estimated time there first and then stroll to the nearby bakery/bubble tea places to hang out before coming back",0
"Came here during covid for a Sunday boozy brunch. I made reservations but I had to wait around 15 min to get a server to seat us because that same host is also a server. The place was packed with people outside and they had servers running in and out. We were seated and 3 of us did the boozy brunch. I got the salmon egg Benedict and that was good! The waffle was also really good there too. So we started off with a glass of mimosa and I realized that other tables had a bottle of mimosa on the table so I asked the waitress if we could get more mimosa. After a while, she brought over a bottle of mimosa for us. We finished the bottle and asked for a second bottle but was told she would have to check to see if we still had time. More than 5 minutes passed and she comes back and brings us another bottle. We finished that and asked for another bottle but was told that she can only give us a glass each and then handed the bill to us.",0
"We had a great time at Scarr's Pizza! The slices were hot and the crust was delicious. It's a bit pricey, but the pizza is definitely worth it. We also loved the variety of dishes they had available, including hot boi and DJ Clark Kent. We're looking forward to trying out more of their menu!",1
I really love Beyond Sushi! This is the second location I've been to and as opposed to their full sit down on 37th this once is just a small quick service place good for takeout or dine in (but limited seating). This location is nice because it's easy to come solo vs doing a while sit down deal. I got the Spicy Mang but I really wanted the bean topping from the La Fiesta so they were nice enough to make me a roll with with Spicy Mang for the filling but the bean topping from La Fiesta. It was great!Also has the watermelon mint lemonade. Loved it.,0
"We had THE best experience at Wo Hop on Thanksgiving. It was easy to find, our vaccine info was checked and then we went downstairs to a table off the kitchen. I enjoyed seeing different dishes coming out. We started off with the boneless BBQ ribs and Steamed Dumplings. Both were sooo good. The ribs had a great flavor and we really enjoyed the steam dumplings too. Just so good. We ordered for dinner Sesame Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein and split it among three people. I loved both dishes,  very fresh and just sooo good. I would definitely go back and I am so glad we came to Wo Hop.",0
"Overall, I had a great experience at Uva. The food was delicious and the service was friendly and attentive. I especially enjoyed the vegetarian antipasto, which was packed with delicious roasted vegetables and creamy burrata. The omelets were also really good, and the rigatoni alla siciliana was a delicious and hearty dish. I was a little disappointed with the pasta dishes, however, as they were a bit on the heavy side for my taste. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend Uva to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal in the Upper East Side.",1
"I'm so happy to have a lunch teishoku (combo) here in NYC! The price is definitely NYC level too......however everything from una-don, soba, and sashimi tasted pretty good. I think it's pretty good Japanese food for the city (I have been disappointed multiple times) so will probably come back again.",1
"Wow wow. I can't rave enough about my experience at La Grande Boucherie. Thank you for hosting this fine Yelp Elite Event!When I went, I wasn't sure how the process would go. I was worried the hosts might scoff at me when i came to redeem my meal or have me wait off to the side, but my experience was the complete opposite. They treated me like a respected guest and even invited me to sit at one of the tables while I waited for my food. My meal took leas than 15 minutes to come out. In that time I got to admire what a beautiful space the restaurant is in. I loved how the tables were separated by glass dividers. The small tables made me feel like I was dining al fresco at a  cafe in France.After my short commute home, I was happy to find that my food was still fresh and warm. The fries were nice and crispy and came with ketchup and Mayo. The steak was tender and medium-well just like I asked for. The herb butter was heavenly.It also wasn't lost on me the effort they put into the packaging. The utensils were wrapped in a cloth napkin, not a paper one. I thought that was a nice touch. Lastly, I thought the steak could have been just a teeny bit more seasoned but with the herb butter it was perfect.",0
I don't know. It was ok. This is going to sound a little odd but the vibe was off in here and I attribute that to bad lighting. Yep. I said that. I don't mean to be too rough on these guys but it was too bright in here. Comfortable enough. Very nice bartender but I only stayed for one drink and then left. Just did not hold my interest.,0
"This place is really confusing. It seems like the dish components don't match and are clashing like a bad band. Individually though, the flavors are tasty and fresh. I was happy to see a clean fast causal spot open up in Harlem, but unfortunately I think they could spend some time rethinking the execution of some dishes. The sticky rice is a sore thumb to some bowls and it feels like you NEED the sauce to mask all of the conflicting flavors youre getting. Staff seemed a bit confused by it all as well. Can't say that I will be back, ever. But glad to have supported the business.",0
"The restaurant is nicely designed with light wood floors and chevron marble. They have a QR code for the menu which we used. We ordered the prime/mari package with lettuce set and grilled mushroom plate. The lettuce set was a lot more than we expected. It included perilla leaves, endives, raw garlic, chili peppers, and carrot sticks. The grilled mushrooms were surprisingly great. They cooked it on a creamy base which was a nice touch. The cocktails were good too. I would like to try the lunch set menu sometime.",1
I used to come here a lot for their happy hour specials however it seemed like they discontinued it. The staff isn't the friendliness but the space is pretty good. I heard they host a lot of events here so it probably gets packed later on in the nights. I would come here again for happy hours and I'll give it another try for the food!,0
My husband was getting a haircut down the street and we random decided to stop by to get dinner here after. We ordered the night market crispy chicken bento box and the original minced pork bento box. Both were good! We refrigerated some and microwaved it a few hours later and it still tasted really good. Overall I feel like this was a solid casual meal for ~12$ per bento box.,0
"I thought this place was okay. Went here with my friends on a Wednesday night. I liked the vibes and the music (DJ) they had that night. We got seated in the lounge area- we asked the waiter if we could move because there was a weird stench that was likely coming from the bathroom. Sitting by the window was better. Drinks were pretty good and average price for the city. And food was your standard bar food. I ended up getting the 8th Ave burger. Nothing to rave about but just what I needed after having been a few drinks in. Wouldn't go out of my way to get here, but if you're close by and looking for a place to grab drinks after work, I would recommend.",0
"My parents and I came here for my birthday dinner and it was quite good. The appetizers that we ordered were okay--nothing too special about them (we got the calamari, the artichoke and the tuna). However, the main courses were great. I got the lobster and my parents got the diver sole and the lamb chops which they both loved. The ambiance was very nice with dim lighting and candlelight, and the wait staff was attentive. I would definitely come here for a special occasion or for a really nice date night.",0
"This place is 5 STARS FASHO! I came here for my birthday and the creamy kimchi udon is to die for. Literally I could take a bath in that sauce. Ambience is fun in an underground basement type vibe with twinkly lights. The izakaya mew roll was also delicious. Frozen beer was cool, but not for me.",1
"Mehh not sure what the hype was all about. I came here after two of my coworkers recommended this place to take someone out for their birthday. food/drink: for the food we ordered chicken taco, shrimp fried rice, shrimp bowl and two drinks. The shrimp bowl was completely bland with no flavor. Had to ask for some sort of sauce to add some flavoring, our waitress brought over two types of green sauce which I guess helped a little bit. Shrimp fried rice was different but not too bad. The chicken taco was delicious. Drinks were strong and probably the best thing that I enjoyed. Service: The man walking around filling up waters was very attentive and would run to serve water as soon as my glass came half full, which was nice. Overall it's an OK atmosphere for music and drinks, definitely not worth it for food. The bill came up to over $130 which is a bit on the pricey side.Wanted to check this place out because of all the hype but would not return.",0
"It says the lunch special is offered every day but when I asked the waiter, he said it doesn't apply on weekends. I don't appreciate the false advertising. The place is supposed to open at 11 but by the time they  finished setting up it was almost 11:15.We got the T-bone steak today which was abt $33 which is abt $2 more than the skirt steak. The steak was tough to cut for a medium steak. It was good but the edges were somewhat burnt. The thai iced tea ($5) is good but overly sweet.",0
I stopped by this restaurant for a quick pre-drinks before Zerospace. The atmosphere was good and the service was attentive. What I didn't love was the calamari - it was really oily and soft. The beers and alcoholic beverages were good though. The ribs I smelled from the table next to me were delicious! I would definitely come back to try some of those!,1
"I was excited to try this restaurant after reading the good reviews, but unfortunately, my experience was not as great. There is extra seating downstairs, so I'm glad we were able to find a spot, but it felt like we were forgotten the entire time we were there. Our waiters and waitresses were not as aware that we were down there, so we felt like we were constantly having to flag someone down to get our drinks or food. It was frustrating to spend almost an hour here when it would have only taken 45 minutes if they had paid more attention to us. The pan fried hand pulled noodles were decent, but I wasn't a fan of the duck. The fish ball with meat was unremarkable, and the noodles were much softer than the pan fried version. The steamed vegetable dumplings were pretty standard, and the xiao long bao was good but not amazing. Overall, I was disappointed by the meal and would not recommend this restaurant.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was excellent and the food was great. I especially enjoyed the soup dumplings. The price was also great for the value. I would definitely come back here.,1
"i've eaten at this restaurant, as well as ordered things to go. this is a SOLID Vietnamese on the upper east side restaurant.i've been here for dinner, lunch, service is great, food is fresh. their pho soup is my favorite, i live closer to Pho Shop on 1st avenue and i never go there anymore - their pho just doesnt compare to Vietnaam's. i've also tried their red curries, which are fantastic. my ultimate favorite food item on their menu is their classic banh mi. the cilantro, cucumbers, and carrots are so fresh, and the bread is toasted, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. i've tried their taro bubble tea, which is just okay, wouldnt get that again. their thai ice teas are good though, standard and not overly sweetened.prices are standard for the UES imo. they also have lunch specials.",0
