"Fantastic!! My husband and I came here pre-theater. We had reservations for a table but decided to sit at the bar instead. Solid decision because they have a bar menu (including happy hour glasses of wine for $8) plus the regular menu, giving us more options. I had the Greek salad and Shrimp Santorini which were both fantastic. The shrimp were fresh and perfectly cooked. The sauce was delicious and there was delicious bread for dipping. My husband had Greek chicken soup and oysters and raves about both. I always struggle to find decent midtown restaurants and this one ticks all the boxes. Great food, great service and a beautiful room. Highly recommend.",0
"The Guac Burger at Vegan Fast Food Place is definitely a good choice for those looking for a vegan option. The patty is made from lentil and pea protein, and is served on a whole grain bun with some guacamole, chipotle aioli, corn salsa, lettuce, tomato, and onion. It's not spicy but has a small hint of heat, and is crunchy on top. The selection of sides and salads makes it easy to customize your meal.",1
"I stopped in at this restaurant after work and I'm glad I did! The service was excellent and the food was delicious. The only downside was that the portions were not as large as I would've liked them to be, but the quality of the food was excellent. I shared a few different tapas and they were all very good. I especially loved the shrimp and mushroom croquettes and the kale salad. My favorite drink of the night was the hot bourbon with amaretto and lemon. All in all, a great experience and I would definitely come back!",1
"This place is beyond magical.It is hard enough to make something that everyone already knows about better. However, to come up with something so new and original and hitting it out of the park is beyond belief. It is like inventing a car when everyone is riding horses.Spicy Mang Roll, Mighty Mushroom Roll, Shiitake Truffle Dumplings, Five Spice Chicken Dumplings all solid five stars as five exclamation marks!!!!! It is not just the taste. It is the quality of ingredients. The micro greens tasted like forest in our mouth with potency of nutrition density and flavors.I had to do tug of war with the waitress when she picked up our empty plate because I wanted to lick the plate of the sauce smeared at the bottom.I used to say that I can easily be vegan if I were Oprah and Beyond Sushi makes the vegan food deliciously and affordably and this place raises the level of vegan experience to Oprah level for me. I can be a vegan if I live close to this restaurant:) At least 80 percent of the time!I am beyond grateful that this restaurant survived pandemic. It is one of the very best NY experience for us.It meets the mark every time in consistency, quality and speed of service and food every time we go there and everything we order. The food presentation and arrangement are also so nice!It is beyond imagination what the most ingredients are.  It is beyond healthy.This is one the the very few places that I can stuff myself and feel absolutely healthy through the entire digestive tract. I can feel my stomach humming like it is going through the car wash!!!Oh man! I wish I were eating there right now!!!!",0
"We had a wonderful experience at Nerai restaurant! The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding. The wine list was extensive, and the desserts were delicious. We would definitely recommend Nerai to others, and we hope to return ourselves soon.",1
"From the moment we arrived, the server was quite rude to us, which I understand is common at many traditional dim sum places, but even my Cantonese friends I was dining with felt it was unnecessarily rude.  The food was not particularly good either; one dish had scallops that were so bitter/sour I had could not eat it and had to spit it out.  Another gross thing here was that there was water dripping from the ceiling that I felt multiple times land on my head, so hopefully there wasn't any that landed in the food. One more thing that bothered us was that they brought some dishes to our table that nobody had ordered.  The price was not too bad for the quantity but compared to some of my favorite places in Chinatown this was both more expensive and lower quality.",0
"This place is a little more expensive than regular Vietnamese pho spots, but it's totally worth it. My friends and I visited 5ive spice on a Saturday around 2pm and it wasn't super busy. We luckily did not have to wait at all. They have both indoor and outdoor dining, but we opted for the indoor. The decor is so cute and the space wasn't squishy. The bathroom is hidden in the bookshelf; thought that was pretty cool.As for the food:- Braised short rib pho: delicious!! The soup was full of flavor. The meat was so soft and tender and fell right off the bone.- Battered fish tacos: not my favorite, but was still good. I wish everything in the tacos were a little crispier.I definitely recommend anyone to visit 5ive Spice. Must give their pho a shot!",0
"I had a wonderful time at Trinity Place! The service was great and the atmosphere was really romantic and historic. The steak dinner was delicious and the cheese and charcuterie board was one of the best I've ever had. The only downside was that the steak was a bit overcooked for my taste, but the Gratin potatoes on the side were really delicious. I really loved the warm chocolate cake for dessert! I can't wait to go back and just have some snacks in the main bar area.",1
"Winter Beer and I came here for a catch-up dinner one day after work. We were able to make a reservation but, around 6 pm on a weekday the place was on the empty side.  I waited a few minutes and had to get someone's attention before I was guided to a seat.  The service overall was a bit slow to get our food and take our order.While I was waiting for WB, I asked the waiter for the list of drink specials. They have different specials depending on which days you can go (they post their specials on their website). We ordered Shirley Temple(s) and Moscow Mule(s).  WB ordered the Poe Poppers ($14 for 4), they thought it was okay and had a nice level of spice. I ordered the crabcake sliders ($14 for 3) and thought it was okay. It was very dry but, otherwise, it was fine.I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich with fries ($13) and thought it was tasty. The fries were hot and crispy. Winter ordered chicken tenders ($12 for 5). They enjoyed the crispy delicious tenders.The most disappointing aspect was the dessert. I ordered churros ($9) which turned out to be more like phyllo dough that was deep-fried. It was oily and tasteless that I didn't even want to waste the calories on it. (And I am known as the human garbage truck as I eat everything). The chocolate lava cake ($9) was a bit dry but, delicious.",0
"Went here for brunch got a deal using Pulsd. Cute and cozy the place was clean and the music selection was good. I went with my mom we ordered the chicken and waffles, portion sizes are on the small size. So we ordered shrimp and grits to share. There is an outside eating area in the back of the restaurant and one bathroom. The options for mimosas were nice but beware did receive a headache after the drinks but we all know bottomless anything is not made with top shelf alcohol. All and all nice place, decent service and food.",0
"Came here during COVID and dined outside. Ordered the 17-piece omakase ($125) and a 300 ml bottle of sake ($23). I would give it a solid 4 stars. The sushi was good but maybe wait until they reopen for indoor dining.PROS- large pieces of fish, all of which tasted very good and fresh (especially loved the salmon, shrimp, and scallop)CONS- ambiance of the outdoor dining wasn't great for the price you pay. Unlike other places, they don't try to decorate the outside in any way or put walls between each table. It's just a few high top round tables along the sidewalk right up against the metal scaffolding- limited sake menu. You can't order by the glass and there's only a couple of bottles to choose from - the dessert was a tiny cheesecake split between two of us - usually you get your own dessert, even if small, so I'm surprised we didn't each get our own (the other option was mochi)- I applaud the creativity with the toppings on the sushi but some of the flavors didn't quite work for me (like some weird green sauce on top of the toro - why would you ruin such a good piece of fish?! Maybe I'm just a purist when it comes to sushi)",0
"Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Scarpetta! The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, and the food was top-notch. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"A solid choice in midtown especially if you have food allergies. My family ordered burgers and I ordered a salad, everything was prepared per our order and was delicious. The food was served in a timely manner which we appreciated since we were in a rush to get to a show. We made reservations and were seated on time. This is a very busy area in Rockefeller Center so highly encourage reservations. Fantastic meal, we will be back!",0
"Brunch review!I came here to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago. We had a party of 10 which turned into a party of 11 the day of and we had no issues. I noticed on the online reservation that anything over 4 guests showed no availability. We called and were told to submit a request and email with credit card info.There's a temp check machine in the hotel lobby and a doorman helping the flow of guests to the elevators. Since it was a bit more chilly out, they must've closed off half the rooftop that wasn't covered. It made it a bit smaller than the pics and vids I've seen, but nonetheless it's a gorgeous space. As the sun got brighter, they opened up the roof and it was still a very comfortable temp.As for food and drinks: - Drinks 4/5 - Decent variety of cocktails that were pretty strong - Food 3/5 - Entrees were nothing spectacular, but not bad either. Most of us ordered the eggs benny or the kobe burger, which were both fine. The only thing my two friends didn't like were the lobster roll. They didn't even finish half of it.Overall, we had a good dining experience. Service was great and constant, but we never felt rushed to leave. It seems like a great place to get drinks, but I probably wouldn't recommend coming for the food.",0
"I ordered the Ora King Salmon, and I was very disappointed with the portion size. The salmon was only around 2oz, and the mushrooms were barely existent. The price tag for the meal was $19, which was too high for what I received. Overall, I am not satisfied with my experience at this restaurant.",1
"I had a disappointing experience at Bocado brunch this past weekend. The item I ordered, a bacon and egg flatbread, was priced at $15.00 during breakfast, but was $24.00 when I got it. Additionally, the flatbread was cold and burned on the bottom. I've had better brunch at other restaurants. I won't be returning to Bocado.",1
"Met a long time friend for brunch and had a good time. Food was good but underwhelming. Nothing spectacular, not bad though. Would not go out of my way to come here again.Average",0
"I've been here a few times for their lunch special. That is prob the only reason I'd return. For 12.95  you get a lot ! However , the attitudes from the waitstaff has to go.  The last time I was there I took my very well behaved small to medium sized dog. I requested to sit outside of course. The waiter looked at her with disgust and asked ""is that your dog ?"" Nah, I just walked over to Tompkins and grabbed one .  Nevertheless, he asked the manager if it's ok. The answer was yes.  When serving the food he was unfriendly to the point I felt embarrassed I recommended this place. My guest asked for white meat chicken for his saag. The waiter said it can't be done for that peculiar dish.  Others yes , but some no.  Meaning , the food is precooked and reheated.  The menu is huge , naan was good though.",0
"I appreciated the wide range of different food/drink options they had and the generally welcoming staff. I did only have their grapefruit green tea and it was quite decent with a fairly sized portion and sufficient sweetness, if not a bit too sweet for me. One of the downsides though is the ventilation system since on a rather cold winter day, they left the door open due to steam/humidity build up. When the door was closed however, the interior became moist and damp. Overall though, it was an alright experience since it's mostly quiet with lots of space despite the temperature fluctuations.",0
"Had high hopes because my friend loves this bar but unfortunately I was not a fan. To start, there was only one bartender and over thirty people at the bar. Needless to say, it was about fifteen minutes until I could even order a drink. I got the Bees Knees and the cocktail was about 90% ice and 10% liquor/mixers. The only reason I didn't give this place one star was because they had bocce but I still wouldn't return.",0
"Sometimes I feel like you need to be rich to survive Manhattan which is why the dance queens have gravitated to Brooklyn.  Westville Kitchen provides a reprieve with quality food at a reasonable price.  Kudos for their cinnamon Old Fashion which in my view is one of the best of Manhattan.  Quality vegetables offered with the meal, your mama will be proud. Good all around and very sweet staff.",0
"I had a great experience at the Pure Thai Cookhouse, but their sister restaurant Taladwat was not as good. The food was good, but the atmosphere was not as vibrant and the prices were a bit high. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic Thai food at a reasonable price.",1
"The restaurant is alright - they only have two woks, so the different bao flavors are mixed and cooked in bulk. It makes sense for the situation, but I wonder if the quality goes down by doing it this way. The 5 for $10 deal is all you need because they're pretty filling. I ordered the pork and the impossibao, and they both were pretty good. The pork was classic and the impossibao wasn't great in my opinion. The regular meat ones taste way better, but it might be because the texture and flavor remind me of beef which I don't like/eat.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The pizza we ordered was terrible - the cheese was stretchy and bland, the sauce had no flavor, and the crust was thin and crunchy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"This is one of my favorite restaurants I've tried in a while. I came with my boyfriend and we shared dishes, but this definitely would be a good place to bring more people too to try a greater variety of dishes. We made a reservation for 6pm on a Friday and were walked to our table pretty quickly. You can tell they put a lot of work into the decor of this place. Even the bathroom had nice soap which I tried to find the brand of but I suspect it may be Aesop soap (it just said Wayan on the bottle). Chicken skewers - really tender chicken and the peanut sauce was amazing. After the chicken was gone I was still scraping the plate to finish the sauceLobster noodles - this was my favorite dish. The noodles remind me of ramen noodles, but the sauce on it was amazing and they are pretty generous with the juicy lobster pieces in it. It's not a huge dish for the price, but definitely high qualityNasi goreng - I thought this dish was good, but skippable for the price. It has a mild spicy flavor but it didn't really stand out to me like the chicken skewers and lobster noodles didPandan custard dessert - great dessert to share and pretty unique. I liked the balance of sweet and sour and the passionfruit seeds on top added a bit of a crunchOverall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner date or night out with friends. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the dishes and the staff were all pretty attentive. I would make a reservation as the place was pretty packed once we left around 7-7:30.",0
"We honestly had the best meal at Soogil last night. From start to finish every dish was a perfect 10. The staff - friendly and incredibly hospitable. The space - open, inviting and lovely. There are add ons to the meal and we recommend not missing any of the additions (the uni and caviar dish was INSANE) We enjoyed delicious, beautifully crafted cocktails - we were extra delighted by the details of the ice.And the foooood, the food. Top tier ingredients prepared with the utmost skill and creativity. I really want to highlight one dish and leave the rest for you to go and experience. The foie gras noorungji dish was such a memorable dish. I love seared foie gras and I am used to it being accompanied by some sort of fruit or balsamic reduction. Last night it was an entirely unique preparation of the liver over a phenomenal bed of crisped seasoned rice reminiscent of the best part of dol sot bibimbap (hot stone bowl bibimbap) that always forms a chewy crisped crust where the rice bed touches the bowl. The pea leaves were wonderfully flavored and as we were finishing our dishes we stuck every last grain of rice onto our forks as not to leave a single one behind. Our server/ bartender Sean was multitasking all night but you wouldn't know it. Incredibly attentive and kind. We really appreciated his service enhancing the experience all together. We also met Chef Soogil, the captain of the ship. Humble and gracious in demeanor and a master of his craft. Thank you from me and my husband and our dear friends for such an extraordinary meal.",0
"I had a decent time at this restaurant. The service was good, and the food was decent. My only complaint is that the first time I got my sweet potato fries, they were cold. However, they were replaced without any problem. The second time I had them, I found what looked like beard hair in them. Ew. Overall, the burger was decent, and the lemonade was a bit off-putting. However, overall it was a decent experience.",1
"The Meatball Shop in Little Italy is a nice place, but it's definitely not the best in the city. The small tables and seating can be a bit cramped, but it's to be expected in a city like New York. The prices are okay, but the dish I ordered - the spicy pork meatballs with rigatoni and butternut squash all in creamy Parmesan sauce - was a bit on the pricey side. I didn't love the meatballs - they were a little bland and the pasta didn't seem to be cooked very well, resulting in it being tough. My boyfriend's classic meatballs, on the other hand, were much better. They were flavourful and had a much better texture. Overall, I don't think the Meatball Shop is worth your time - there are a lot of other options out there that are much better.",1
"Came here for a work team dinner and the outdoor seating are was pretty nice. The items on the menu were all pretty pricey but luckily this was on our corporate card. The food was good for the most part, but not high enough quality that I would ever pay that price for it myself.",0
"Cafe Katja was awesome. My party of three shared the Wiener schnitzel, Austrian meatballs (best thing we ate), Bratwurst, Little gem and Roasted root vegetables. (The veggies were sort of redundant because some of the other dishes came with them as sides, but still great). Great service and no wait at around 7 PM on a weeknight.",0
"I came here for dinner on a weekend and chose the All You Can Eat for $38. The sushi quality was OK, the sashimi wasn't amazing, and the rolls were average. The inside of the restaurant was cold and the service was mediocre.I would say if you are really hungry & craving sushi and you don't care too much about quality or atmosphere, this place is good. Otherwise, I'd try some other spots in the area.",0
This restaurant is great for vegetarians and people with lactose intolerance! The food is amazing and very authentic. I would definitely recommend trying it out!,1
"I highly recommend this restaurant - the line wasn't too bad, but so worth the wait. I have never gone to a place this dining style so it was a great experience. The good was quickly served. The whole dish was delicious and I will definitely go back!",1
"This place is super spacious and located inside Chelsea Market. If you just enter the market and keep walking, you'll be sure to see it. Inside, there's a lot of bar seating, so I wouldn't worry too much about table availability unless you have a huge group. You order at the back and then pick it up nearby. The ambiance is nice as you can see the sushi chefs preparing things in the middle and the seafood area on the left. Lobster Roll Picnic Box ($24) - This is actually super pricy for what you get. It comes with a lobster roll, a small soup, and chips. I got the lobster bisque for my soup and it was just alright. It tasted weird - like slightly bitter. Chips are standard potato chips. As for the actual lobster roll, it had a generous of lobster in it, but I felt like it lacked a lot of flavors. The roll itself was also pretty flavorless and thought it could use a lot more butter. Overall, unremarkable lobster roll especially for the price.",0
"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Poco. My group made reservations well in advance, but we had to wait 45 minutes. The tables were so crowded and hectic outside that it was uncomfortable for those sitting at the outdoor tables. Additionally, one of the bartenders quit just before we were sat, and management was not prepared for the large group. We were finally seated downstairs, but were split up to three different tables which was not what we wanted or expected. The food is not worth coming for, especially when compared to other restaurants in the area. I would not recommend this restaurant to a large group or someone looking for a relaxing experience.",1
"Wonderful service, a classy yet comfortable atmosphere, perfectly crafted drinks, and wonderfully tasty food! We had one of the cheese boards to start and it was so yummy! For my entree, I ordered the Ravioli which was absolutely amazing! I don't remember what everyone else in my party had but they all raved about their meals almost as much as I raved about mine. Our server was so friendly and she really made the experience that much better. Giving Tarallucci E Vino 5 stars is a no-brainer!",0
"Overall, I think the food is pretty good at this restaurant. I especially enjoy the steak quesadilla, which is listed as an appetizer but is actually quite filling. The al pastor tacos are also good, but I would recommend opting for the flavored margaritas instead of the regular ones. One downside to the restaurant is that they automatically add a 20% tip to your bill even if you're dining solo, which can be a bit deceptive.",1
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The menu sounded great, but I was sadly wrong. The food was terrible - I ended up having to order pizza. The calamari was a rubber band, and the chicken wings were only cooked on one side. The dumplings were also very bland and had a very weak garlic flavor. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"This restaurant is a mess. The seating area is really inconvenient, and it took forever for anyone to come by and take our orders. The drinks were really expensive, and we didn't even get to try the food because it took so long. Overall, this place is really disappointing.",1
I got a chicken shish sandwich and fries for takeout. I was expecting a pita sandwich but it came in this huge thick fried bread and was really hard to eat.  I wish it was clear from the description what kind of bread would be used.  The sandwich was mostly bread.  The filling was good but it was hard to get to.  The fries were also soggy and limp.,0
"I visited this restaurant for dinner and was very pleased. The scallion pancake was crispy and delicious. The hot sour soup was quite spicy and sour, making everything else taste nice and spicy. The rice cakes are too filling for us, but I would come back for the soup dumplings again. They're very consistent and thin dumpling skin with porky broth. Joe's Shanghai is better, but this restaurant is much more convenient.",1
I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. I had to go to the hospital afterwards because my hands and feet swelled up! It was definitely due to the high amount of salt in my food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,1
"I had a great experience at Yubu! The food was decently filling and reasonably priced, and the yuja ade was refreshing and tasty. The only downside is that the location is likely quite expensive to rent, which may put some people off. Overall, I highly recommend Yubu!",1
"Kentucky Pizza is an absolute hidden gem in the city. The wood-fire pizza is some of the best I've had, and the atmosphere is really nice too. Definitely want to come back!",1
"I ordered here for delivery last night and the order was quick and on time. Like spot on on time. Real friendly delivery guy too. I had a late night dinner and was glad they're open late an blue to deliver at night. I ordered the salmon lovers sushi, 1 salmon sashimi, and the tuna/salmon/eel combo with miso soup and the salad. I don't have a photo of the combo because I basically scarfed it down. It was really good and tasted fresh. I'm a huge sushi and seafood lover. I had the salmon lovers the next day purposely saved it for the next day and it was still fresh! Each of these are filling",0
"I would give this restaurant three and a half stars if I could. We had a group of six coming for dinner and service was painfully slow! Our waitress came over and spoke to two people at one side of the table and talked about some of the specials while the rest of us chatted and didn't realize why she left. We eventually were told the specials and ordered our drinks. Twenty minutes later she came back with our drinks which were scattered, so some of us had our drinks and some of us didn't. We finally placed our order. Again it took forever to get our food! The food was very good... My friend and I shared the red snapper which was very tasty, and octopus which was decent. Most others seemed to like their meals. The meals were very small, so be prepared! Hated that they charge six dollars for bread! A couple of dinner rolls with some butter 6$! You've got to be kidding me! It was tasty bread but come on...plain hot bread and butter is more than good enough! When we went to pay our tab, again painfully long time to wait for the check. That was the one time they apologized saying they had some new system and that was why it took so long. Everything else",1
"I used to love going to this restaurant, but the quality has gone down significantly in the past few months. The oil is starting to smell bad, and the drunken noodle was really gross - I had to spit it out. The green beans were also not fresh, which was a disappointment. I'm not sure if the prices have gone up because of COVID, or if the quality has gone down, but I'm not sure if I'll be returning any time soon.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The Huevos Revueltos en Salsa Verde was delicious. I tried the home made sangria, mimosa and their traditional margarita. I liked the sangria the best. Thank goodness for vacations, drinking at 11am was pretty interesting.",1
"Can't go wrong with 212s.It used to be the spot back when I was in highschool and it has remained one of my go tos now that I'm an adult. You can't beat their prices, the drinks are strong and cheap. Those bartenders do not skimp. Only reason I took a star off is because they took the edamame off the menu, the fried calamari's recipe must've changed and our waitress had a stank ass attitude. You really shouldn't be working in a bar if you can't handle a few intoxicated folk. Rolling your eyes at paying customers and quite blatantly too, is far from cute. You never know who's watching. Anyway, their tada chicken is my favorite thing on the menu and the best drunk snack. Solid spot.",0
"Wow! I have to say this place surpassed ALL expectations! Randomly was looking for somewhere vegan and good near me, and ended up going with this amazing place! Since it was the first time, my friend and I asked for advice in terms of what to pick to try. The staff was very friendly, atmosphere was super cute! It felt like a laboratory in a vintage chic space! What we ordered: Vegan chili with a side of vegan curry jackfruit: 5/5 Everything was Delicious! The chili was bursting with flavors, and it tasted exactly like a homemade cozy bowl of chili. The jackfruit had a very nice texture and flavor as well. Vegan bolognese:  5/5 Superb!! The sauce was bursting with flavor, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegan meat tasted like non vegan food!Definitely would come here again! A great place to go for a date night or casual outing. Food also seemed very healthy and filling!",0
"I had a great time at Spicy Village! The food was great and the prices were really affordable. I especially loved their soup dumplings. The beef and pork pancakes were also really good. The last dish I had was the spicy beef hand pulled noodles. They were really spicy, but I loved them. I definitely recommend checking out this restaurant if you're in Chinatown!",1
"I loved everything about my dining experience here. Got there at noon and waited 15 minutes for a table. Restaurant is situated on the corner of Mott and Kenmare. Outdoor dining is set up on both sides. We sat on the Mott St side in a covered installation with heating on the sides and overhead. Air still came through but it was manageable. As for food, we tried the Thai Diner egg sandwich (minus the American cheese)- so basically egg, the herbal sausage, and Thai basil wrapped in roti; and also the Thai tea babka French toast with Thai tea butter and condensed milk syrup. Both are offered under the Breakfast section available until 5pm.Under House Specialties, we got the duck noodle soup , the stuffed cabbage, and the crab fried rice. The portions were generous but more importantly the flavors were as complex as expected for the dish (as described) and tasty. What a delight to our senses. We saved the French toast for dessert but also added the warm coconut beignets with pandan and guava custards. We ate everything and left no crumbs. Expect creativity and fusion fare.. and to enjoy everything.  You just have to pick your protein and decide if you want rice or noodles. Everything so far has been delicious. I am determined to try all the items.",0
"Delicious beef noodle soup, great service, and safe outdoor seating arrangement during Covid. I wouldn't hesitate to make a breakfast or dinner reservation on Resy.",0
"We came on a late afternoon and waited around 15 minutes or so. This is a small place (probably fits around 15 patrons) with bar seating only. It was busy when we came so we found service a bit lacking. There was only one waitress. After we were seated, she did not give us a menu so we got up and grabbed one ourselves. We were missing a cup of water and she was prompt about getting us one, but poured us a half-filled cup. She came by after 5 minutes and asked if we were ready... No, I mean we just sat down and weren't served any menus. We had to get the menu ourselves. We usually enjoy ramen joints where you can watch the chefs cook, but here, we found there to be a strong smell of grease. The chef cooking in front of us was friendly. We were served our ramen without spoons and he quickly got spoons for us after we asked. Don't expect the ramen to be authentic, but the dishes are relatively cheap and filling. The soup wasn't very salty, which we like, but the broth lacks depth. I also found the meat a little too lean for my liking. Other than the narutomaki and a few keychains/posters of anime on the wall, there isn't anything special about this ramen joint. It's worth coming if you are looking for a cheap eat, but I wouldn't come back if I had to wait long.",0
"We stopped by this restaurant after High Street on Hudson was closed for lunch. 

It's so cute! Like a diner, but better, with excellent service in a cozy space (with a gorgeous towering flower arrangement). 

Not sure I'd order anything I wouldn't ordinarily get in a diner, though it seems many people adore the pasta dishes. We'll be back!",1
"I wanted to try another ramen restaurant. We usually go to ippudo. We're happened to be in the area and picked this place. The question is...will I come back? Not sure. But it is decent. Not the best ramen I have tried but I am an advanced ramen eater though. So I'm a bit picky on taste, noodle, and topping and broth. When the ramen came out, from the look and smell, I was very excited. But once I tried the broth, noodle and topping, here is my analysis. Noodle is slightly form which I love. Rating 4/5 for this. Broth is very salty for me but I added some water and it was editable. I'm not one who like salty foods. Rating for broth is 3/5 for me. The topping consists of half an egg, which was perfectly cooked, mushrooms (yum!) and chasu, which looked yummy but can definitely be perfected by cooking a bit longer for the meat to basically melt in your mouth. Overall, topping was a 3/5 for me. I wasn't even done with my meal and the table is already clean. The waitresses were very diligent. My bill came out to be $38. I gave 40$ in cash and left another $5 at the table when the waitress came back out and say, ""here is your change and you didn't give tips. It's supposed to double the tax."" . Gosh I'm sure it's not meant to be rude but it came out that way. I looked at my boyfriend in shock. Moral of the story, put your tips together when paying for your meal. Do not separate it.",0
"Food is okay. It's your standard burgers and chicken sandwiches to chicken tenders that comes with either fries, onion rings or salad. We ordered cheeseburger w/opinion rings and spicy chicken sandwich with fries. Fries was not bad at all. Food came out in a timely manner; sandwiches were good.  Service is awesome.  Staff were very welcoming, courteous and customer service-oriented. Loved their onion rings; way better than Juniors by Marriott Marquise on 45th Street Times Square. Loved how they have different condiments and not just ketchup...they even have mayo. Perfect location as it's nearby the entrance to the cruises.",0
"We ordered through seamless and food was delivered perfectly. And for those who are not supportive of restaurants now it is a shame. I have seen the news on what the chef said however, he apologized and let's move on. On to the food! The ceviche was by far the best in the city! We ordered both versions, the seafood and fish! The best flavors (very tangy and full of citrus) and look forward to continue supporting this restaurant!",0
"We made a reservation at 6:30pm, got there at 6:25pm and was told that the table is only good until 08:00pm. First, if you are serving course dishes, let customers enjoy food and give us at least 2 hours. plus.. let me take my time and drink my bottle of wine (they did not kick us out after 8:00pm. we left at 8:30pm - since there was a plenty of empty tables around us).For the first course, we had beef tartare, yellowtail and snap pea. wish the size for yellow tail was smaller, but it was refreshing and melted in my mouth. beef tartare was my flavorful and snap pea was good as well. 2. crab, endive, egg. highly recommend endive. maybe it was our favorite out of everything. crab was little salty, but still good. not recommend egg if you do not like fishy food. it can be very fishy, but I liked it. my friend hated it though.3. mackerel was 3/5 for me (the soup color was greenish black.. I asked our server what was in it and he explained, but the color wasn't that attractive to us. but the fish was super tender and delicious). Octopus was 4/5 and it tasted like I am eating chipotle and we all agreed. galbi was really tender and flavorful.big minus was from fried chicken. I wouldn't order chicken, especially if they are $23. big mistake.. their portion is small, we get it. they only serve 5-6 pieces of fried chicken and it was super dry inside and we were very disappointed. Also, we did not like apple kimchi at all. not sure why they put it as their side dish.. it was really bad.... Overall, good experience. would I be back? possibly :)",0
"I stopped by this bar for a quick drink after work and it was really great! The drinks are a little pricier than I would have liked, but the atmosphere and vibe are really good. It can get busy at night, especially if there's a big game on, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",1
"This place was great! We came here on Friday for lunch as a group of 6 and were seated immediately. The waiter was really nice and we were able to order quickly after sitting down. The interior is really cute, kind of vintage looking. They also bring you really delicious bread and olive oil. I loved the olive oil, I thought it was top quality unlike olive oil I've had at some other Italian restaurants. What I got:- Cacio e Pepe - this was creamy without being overly rich, and was salted perfectly. One of the better ones I've had.- Soup of the Day - I can't remember what exactly was in this, but it was some sort of vegetable soup with ricotta added. Whatever it was, it was delicious.We asked for our food to be brought out whenever it was ready, and it ended up coming very quickly (in around 20 minutes). We also all got our food at about the same time, which was a bonus! Our total came to about $25 a person. This was a great Italian restaurant, although it is on the pricier side.",0
"There was moderate air conditioning here when I came here with my visiting gentleman friend on a hot day.  We were there to linger somewhat so even though service was slow, the experience wasn't that bad.  I got a burger that was yummy and my friend got the catfish pops.  On a cooler day, it's probably nicer but overall it was fine.  It wasn't too loud or too crowded so probably a good place to bring a date.  I was mostly focused on my gentleman friend.",0
this spot is my go to for lunch during work break. it is so cheap and delicious. has so many delicious italian meals besides pizza. the service their is spectacular. the cashier and the pizza guy are the kindest and friendliest people ever.,0
"We had a great experience at Hell's Kitchen brunch! The service was friendly and welcoming, and the staff was able to accommodate our dietary restrictions. The menu had a great variety of options, and we were able to try both the Grain Bowl and the Steak and Eggs. We were a little disappointed with the Steak and Eggs, as it wasn't anything to write home about, but the Grain Bowl was a delicious and healthy option. The only issue we had was with the bugs flying around. It was quite bothersome, especially considering we were seated indoors. The ambiance was lovely, so hopefully, they can deal with the bugs to offer a more pleasant experience.",1
"We decided to try this place because it got rave reviews on all the GF blogs. It was great that everything was GF but I felt like I had better meals at other places in NYC. I got the spaghetti with clams and my husband got the chicken parmigiana with a side of spaghetti. They also gave us a bread basket, which was divine. The problem was I felt like the pasta sauces in both dishes were a bit on the bland side, especially for the price.The ambiance was great and they had a lot of seating for such a small place. Also the service here was top notch. I just wish the food had been a bit more exciting. I will definitely come back but I wouldn't order the same thing again.",0
"I really like this place! the service is great and the dishes are good! this review is after a couple visits. and each time I left with a more than satisfied stomach  For appetizers, we've tried the cucumber, eggplant, scallion pancake, liangfen happy tears, and the sticky rice with lotus root. The sticky rice with lotus root is a cold and sweet dish. Very minimal sticky rice, its only stuffed within the holes of the lotus root. Personally, that was not a dish for me. It was sweet and thick, kinda tastes like cold red bean soup tbh LOL, more of a dessert than appetizer. I really liked the liangfen happy tears, its mung bean noodles chopped into cubed form soaked in chili hot sauce. The noodles are slippery so the chili sauce doesn't stay on which doesn't make the chili sauce overpowering. The eggplant comes in a pretty big portion, good enough to share with 3 people! For drypot I stuck to the basics. I think it's better to share than to get your own pot so you can order different variety and then have a little hit of everything rather than having to finish a whole pot on your own! My favorite add in is the potato wide noodle. The roe filled fish balls didn't really taste must roe though. Overall, the mala flavor was there and all the food was good. 2 appetizers + one big drypot to share was only around $50 pretip! I'll definitely becoming back!!!",0
"We went as a party of four on a Saturday for lunch. We ordered:- Rubirosa Salad- Rubirosa Carbonara (single portion)- Tie-dye Pizza (18"")We enjoyed all three dishes we ordered, and they were also good enough amount of food for us.Rubirosa salad was well-seasoned. I enjoyed the accent that the celery slices provided in terms of flavor and texture.The carbonara pasta was good, too. I felt that it was a little too creamy for my taste, so I might have preferred more pepper, but I enjoyed it regardless.The tie-dye pizza had a great texture despite having such a thin crust: crispy on the outside but not to the point of being brittle. The tomato sauce felt nice and sweet, with a small pinch of kick (presumably, they used chili flakes when making the sauce from scratch). But the basil pesto was a bit mild-flavored for my taste.The bill at the end, split among four people, was around $20 each, which I thought was very good value for an enjoyable meal in NY. Would recommend!",0
"I understand the COVID-19 pandemic has been hard on a lot of restaurants, but given that Thai-ish and One Two Thai also now have lunch specials around $10, Lan Larb's price point is not even attractive for the quality of their food. The first week they reopened, I ordered their premium ""Lunch Special Recommendation"" with crabmeat, roast pork, egg noodles, and chinese broccoli in soup ($15). I don't know if they forgot to put it on, but there was absolutely no crab to be found and only 3 thin slices of roast pork. It wasn't a big deal at the time so I let it go. Over the course of the next few weeks, I ordered the pad kee mao lunch special twice, but both times instead of the chicken larb, I was given 2 spring rolls as the appetizer. The pad kee mao was acceptable. Only because I've been coming here for 3+ years today I ordered again - pad thai this time - and again I received 2 spring rolls. The pad thai today came practically white (instead of the typical orangeish-yellow I've come to expect), and completely lacked flavor.

I have one more order scheduled for tomorrow",1
"Contactless orderingSimple delicious vegetarian meals, completely customizable, down to sauces and spice level.Lots of seats",0
"Came to the restaurant on a Friday night with 2 other friends. The interior had a diner like feel and had lots of seating. To order your food, you simply check off how much of each thing you want on a paper menu. We ordered the chips and guacamole. The chips were a bit too hard and thick for me to enjoy and the guacamole could use a lot more flavor. For my meal I got 2 chicken tacos and 1 beef taco. I wasn't a fan of the beef but the chicken was amazing. They also had a spicy salsa at the table so adding that was a perfect addition. Our waiter was also really attentive and checked on us just the right amount of times. Paying was also made simple since she had a hand held payment system so we could easily split the check. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious so I'd come back again.",0
"We came here for Valentine's Day Part 2 and we ordered the combination D with Cajun flavor, two fresh scallops with garlic & scallions, cucumbers with garlic and Dan Dan noodles. The food was okay but the people are pretty pushy to sell their fresh seafood. When we first arrived, my boyfriend and I both needed to use the restroom so we took turns going while the other person sat at the table and the waiters were telling us what they have and that we should try this and that while we we're alone. When my bf was in the restroom, they asked me if we were ready to order, I said I'll wait until he's back to look over the menu together. The waiter waited next to our table until he was back and keep pushing us to get more food than we can consume. Overall, I may be back to try other things but the 4 items we order came out to be $162 with tip, a bit pricey for Chinatown. For seafood boil, it may be not worth it compared to the other places we tried but we might come back for the regular seafood dishes when we have a bigger party.",0
"I love this restaurant! It's a great place to get dinner before a show. The prices are great and the sushi is especially delicious during happy hour. The only downside is that it's a bit of a walk up a flight of stairs from the street level. But overall, I highly recommend it!",1
"Chick'nCone is a delicious concept, and I think it will translate well to other areas as the brand expands.Located in the Underground Market, this place is awesome and relatively affordable. My first Chick'nCone experience was actually in Bryant Park during the summer, and again at the Winter Market there. It's a nice treat and extremely easy to eat on the go. The fries are good, though the real winner here are the awesome cones with a variety of flavors (my preference is the buffalo bleu cheese one). Service here has always been great, and ordering is easy as can be. While there isn't a ton of seating near here, you can still snag a seat if you time it right.I wish Chick'nCone much success in their franchising efforts. The restaurant industry is a tough business, though with this unique and high-quality product (that is very IG-friendly too!), I think they'll make it.Overall: 4.5 stars----Pros:- Excellent chicken, good fries.- Pricing is fair for NYC.- Great service.Cons:- Shame there isn't more seating, though they can't help their location.- Portions could be bigger for the price.",0
"I stopped by last night (Monday) and it was my first time here. The bar area is large and they took a reservation for our party of 10 to get drinks and have a place to sit. The place wasn't busy at all, but it was also a Monday, so I'm sure that changes as it gets closer to the weekend. Everyone at my company was happy with how comfortable the chairs and sofa were and the level of service we got. I would definately recommend for work drinks or perhaps a date night.",1
"The shrimp and broccoli dish at this Chinese restaurant was a bit different than what I'm used to, but it was still good. The shrimp were a bit larger than I'm used to, but the price was also a bit more. The rice lacked salt, but that's always the case with take out. The food wasn't too greasy either. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was flavorful and the prices were very reasonable. I especially enjoyed the Mandarin Duck dish - it was cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying meal at an incredibly competitive price.,1
"I definitely enjoyed my lunch at Drunk Man Noodle! The portion sizes were really generous, and the appetizers were excellent. I also really liked the spice - it was definitely spicy, but in a good way. The only downside was that the flavors weren't all that great. The beef was pretty dry and flavorless, and I didn't enjoy the noodles all that much. But overall, I'd definitely recommend this spot!",1
"Came to this place because a friend chose to try it out. Place is tiny and pink as in the description/pictures. The chairs and seating is uncomfortable. Food and drink menus are small as well, and prices are high for the quality of the food. Reservations are taken but you must hold it with a credit/debit card and if you don't show up they charge you. We ordered the homemade carbonara and it wasn't bad but I wouldn't come back for it. The pasta was al dente and tasted more like a bowl of noodles. Portions are small don't come here if you're hungry. The sautéed green were literally salad greens that were warmed up. The place is tiny but there were tables available and the staff wasn't able to sit customers that were waiting for longer than 15 minutes. They seem like they all need more training in how to manage the space and wait times. This place is definitely for people to come and take pictures for their social media accounts. If you're a foodie and a person looking for ambiance this is not the place for you. Another thing they only take cash and American Express? Which was a surprise for me, that's annoying. I think that if social media wasn't around this place wouldn't survive. Try it if you want pink pictures but I spent $60 on a bowl of noodles and a subpar drink.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was clean and the service was good. However, I thought the food was a bit dry and the portions were small. I also thought the omelet my friend ordered was a bit too cheesy.",1
"Chi Dumpling & Noodle is a restaurant that I would not recommend. The food is not good and the prices are low, which is a crime. The salmon was overcooked and had no flavor, and the other items that came with the meal were mediocre as well. The portions were also small, which was a disappointment. The passion fruit black bubble tea was bitter and nasty, which was a huge disappointment. Overall, I would not recommend Chi Dumpling & Noodle to anyone.",1
"I love Mala project!! It's such a fun place to go eat with friends. Warning: when they say spicy, they really aren't lying. In my experience, mild is the perfect spice level and I'm one of those people who enjoys spicy food. Anyway as the name implies, dry hot pot is basically hot pot minus the liquid. You can get as many toppings as you want; general rule of thumb seems to be around 3 toppings per person. If you're hungry, definitely go for 3+; if you don't have much of an appetite, you might be able to go for 2-3 toppings/person. As far as /what/ toppings to order, I'm a big fan of the frog legs (sadly, it's not always available) which are very juicy. I also like the fish fillet, enoki mushrooms (they soak up a ton of flavor), and potatoes/Napa cabbage adds a nice touch.",0
"I totally returning to Noree Thai restaurant after giving up on waiting at Uncle Boons. The food was great, and I loved the outdoor set up. The service was also great, and the staff was professional and super friendly. The only downside was that the wine list was lackluster.",1
"I always try to be extra (spendy) when it's my birthday and The Peak was the perfect choice since I also wanted to visit The Edge. First off, reservation in advance is needed to make sure you allot extra time to finish your dinner and lunch and strategically (try) to come before sunset and finish after sunset so you can see both views at The Edge.Cocktails are so unique and worth a try. The red drink is called The Bees Knees and it taste so good! The presentation is definitely the cherry on top! There was 6 of us on the table so we decided to try all entrees. Make sure to get the Milk bread to start because it is also a perfect pair for the cocktails. The best appetizer for my opinion is the Rigatoni. The feta taste is just perfect and out of this world good! My personal favorite entree is the Duo of Pork -  it is so decadent and the flavors are superb! We also ended up ordering all the dessert in the menu and each one of them has its perfect sweetness and awesome finish to the dinner. I highly recommend this for very special occasions and I would totally go back for our anniversary!",0
"I had a good experience at this restaurant, but there are some downsides. First, the dim sum is good, but there are not many vegetarian options. Second, the outdoor seating can be quite busy, so be prepared to wait. Third, the takeout containers for the noodles and other items are not very appetizing, so it's best to order these items separately if you want to eat here.",1
"{Overall: 4; Food: 4} Atmosphere: 4.5; Service: 4Flavors just like how Uncle Boon's used to be. Really hearty, rich, flavorful Thai food that doesn't disappoint. Good Thai option for those of us who don't do well with spiciness. Did walk in - they told us the wait would be over an hour, but it ended up being less than 30 minutes. Service here is really quick.We ate: - Khao soi kaa kai: Chicken is so tendy; curry is so rich and creamy. Awesome. - Khao phat rot fai: Thai fried rice that really hits the spotThe restaurant has really awesome decor - a cross between a diner and traditional Thai touches. There's a huge outdoor covered structure.Looking forward to trying the more unique, diner-inspired dishes next time.",0
"I really love Thai Terminal! They are a good spot in the neighborhood, are fairly priced, attentive staff, and a fun Thai ambiance. Food portions are great, and they have a relatively inexpensive drink menu. I usually get the red curry, which is consistently good. This time I got the calamari and chicken wings which were two great appetizers. I would love it if they had dumplings that didn't have shrimp in them, but other than that I enjoy everything about them. Order takeout, dine in, support your local East Village restaurants :)",0
"I don't think I've ever had an Umami burger, but on this visit I ordered a salad. Before you ridicule me, this is why: Ritual was having their $1 week, so I was able to order their taco salad for $1. It was surprisingly good. This comes with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled onions, avocado, tortilla strips, seasoned taco meat (extra $2 for protein), and jalapeño dressing on the side. It sounds like it would be a heavy salad, but it actually wasn't. It was the perfect portion. Not sure I'd order it at its full price, but maybe I'll finally try the burger next time!",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The rice rolls were a bit different than what I'm used to, but they were delicious. The rice sheets were a bit thicker, which I found to be a nice change. There was a lot of filling and green onions, which made them delicious. The hot sauce was a nice touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and would go back myself.",1
"Came here with a Time Out coupon, but it wasn't particularly good. Tried the fried calamari, the steak and the salmon. Everything was on the blander side. The salmon came in a soup bowl and was difficult for me to cut the salmon without turning over the bowl. Wouldn't come here again.",0
"What a wonderful dinner experience! This will be a regular for me for sure!Service was speedy, the food was superb, and the outdoor seating is perfect. We got the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was rich in pesto sauce and diced tomatoes, perfect way to start the meal.We also got the large shroomtown pizza for two, and it was a generous portion. The crust is thin without being dry. The pizza is rich with portobello, shiitake, and button mushrooms so if you are a fan of mushrooms, you definitely will not be disappointed. Another unique thing about the pizza is that it has a thin layer of marinara, which pairs perfectly with the crispy crust. Definitely one of the best mushroom truffle pizzas I've tasted in the city!",0
"Went to Le Coucou with two others a few months ago.  I had made a reservation a month in advance, and it wasn't too difficult to get a seating at a standard seating time when booked out that early.The restaurant is dimly lit, large, and very beautifully decorated.  Service from start to finish was great -- the hosts were gracious, the barstaff was excellent, and the servers were very attentive.I tried the following dishes:Saumon aux concombres, vinaigrette citronee (4.5/5): A very nice rendition of a classic dish.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, flaky and soft, and went really nicely with the citrus vinaigrette.  It was also presented in a really nice way.Navets en guise d'escargots (4/5): A really interesting dish that I did enjoy.  I thought that the turnips were well-disguised as escargots, but were obviously not a perfect match.  The butter/herb sauce that it came with was great.Quenelle de brochet ""Route de Reims"" (4.5/5): This quenelle was very good, and very very rich.  The fish was so soft and creamy, and the savory flavor was both light and heavy.  It worked very well.Halibut, beurre blanc (4/5): Halibut in beurre blanc with daikon.  It was a very solid dish, but it wasn't unique.  I did enjoy it.Bouillabaisse souvenir de Marseille (3.5/5): A decent dish.  The seafood was really fresh, as would be expected, but it was otherwise forgettable.I had a great experience at Le Coucou and would definitely return!",0
"I got the famous Japanese breakfast set here.I definitely recommend it. My favorites in the plate were the mackerel fish (saba) and the onsen egg. Hard to find these delicacies outside of Japan and that they be cooked really well. The two things I didn't like was the arugula salad and the lack of little containers for each part of the meal. It was missing flavor and depth. It just tasted like dry bitter leaves. They could have picked tastier fresh arugula from the market it would have tasted better. This was definitely arugula from a box from Ralphs or something. Also in Japan each food is separated in its own little bowl. They should have put the salad, pickles, brussel sprouts etc in their own little bowl so it would feel more like a set. They instead put everything on the same plate...I also really liked the iced barley tea they gave us.Altogether very health, very good service, tasty, and beautiful decor",0
"I wasn't impressed with the food at this restaurant. The tacos I tried were bland and the guacamole was watery. The decor is really pretty, but the food doesn't live up to the hype. The service was good, though.",1
"I always have a great time when I go to this restaurant. The food is always great and the service is always prompt. I never have to wait long to be seated, and the food always tastes great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"CDG is easily one of my top 3 favorite Korean restaurants in Midtown. There's almost always a wait nowadays, but trust me, it's worth it. First of all, the banchan is always so fresh, seasonal, and plentiful. We literally once told a waitress to stop bringing us refills because she kept coming back with more and more, completely unsolicited, and it was fantastic but I lack the self-control to stop myself from getting full off them!Next, the dishes are all so delicious but you MUST get their Soybean Biji (biji-jigae). The tofu is made fresh in-house, and the flavors of umami hit you with full-force with every single bite! I prefer the original soybean flavor over the kimchi, because it really leaves tofu as the star (supported by a wonderful cast of pork belly bits). It truly is the perfect cold-weather dish (not that weather would stop me from still ordering this over anything else). But don't get me wrong, their other dishes are still super delicious and perfect for sharing with a group as a starter/side. Their bossam is really tender and flavorful and I love the special kimchi that it comes with. Their stir-fried spicy pork is also extremely solid and comes out in a generous portion, making it perfect for sharing at $25.",0
"The Philly cheesesteak sandwich was unfortunately quite dry and full of fat. The meat itself didn't taste too bad, but the overall meal was not very enjoyable. The Caesar salad on the other hand was really good, and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something light and fresh. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to others and I wouldn't return in the future.",1
I had a great time at MaLa Project! The food was authentically Sichuan and I really enjoyed the small portions. The restaurant's atmosphere was really cozy and I felt really warm and full after my meal. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great mala meal in NYC.,1
Great service and fantastic service. I really enjoyed having a date night here with my wife. Their portions are huge so it's great that we were ableTo do half portions on basically everything. We had the burrata appetizer and then the fettuccini and the rigatoni with vodka sauce. Delicious!! Absolutely yummy and the bread was also amazing!! Really enjoyed and can't wait to come again!,0
"Had an 8:30 reservation for dinner on a Friday. The scene was buzzing. It was lively and trendy. We were seated immediately after checking in. Service was 5 star as was the food. Dining during covid-19 can be difficult but Brooklyn Chophouse made it safe, enjoyable and delicious.",0
"Although the dessert menu is small, I was really happy with the crepes. They had a nice variety of flavors, and the service was friendly. The frozen yogurt was a bit of a disappointment; it looked like it had been sitting there for a while, and all the slices of fruit were brown. That said, the yogurt was still tasty, and I would definitely recommend this place.",1
Nish Nush is a great place to go for a casual meal before an infusion. The falafel burger is a must-try and the halloumi salad is also delicious. The fries are average but the condiments make up for it. The place is clean and the service is good. We'll definitely be back!,1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay - some dishes were better than others. The drinks were good though. I wasn't a big fan of the peanut butter sauce for the summer rolls though - it was way too creamy and didn't have the contrast I like. The beef pho was also a bit lackluster - I liked it without the brisket and extra eye round, but the broth was pretty forgettable. The service was okay - we had to flag down the servers a couple of times, and there seemed to be some confusion about who was serving us. Overall, I would say it's a decent place to stop by for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was really good and the service was great. I ordered the duck bowl and it was really good. I was really full after I ate it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"I had a great experience eating at this restaurant. The chicken was delicious and the service was great. It can take a while for orders to come out, but other than that, it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"My first time here was in 2011, on the very night when The NY Times dubbed this restaurant ""like Rao's, but you can can get a table."" There were no tables available that night, or for a long time after. This favorite secret haunt of David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz and so many well-known names had ""arrived."" And so had I. Alone. Looking for a good meal. Excited by what I'd read on the train into the city after moving away. Emilio met me at the door and said, ""Okay! Have a seat at my table."" It was the only seat left, and I sampled this delicious food on a glorious night while sitting with the owner's personal friends. I learned about his history, the family, how he sources his San Marzano Tomatoes from an exclusive farm in Italy, and how he made a deal with them not to distribute to other restaurants in America. I brought my teenage children back tonight, and it was just as delicious and perfect as it was eight years ago. Homemade pasta. Sauce that invites you to scrape the plate. It's love in food form. I can't wait to come back.",0
"My husband and I were wandering around South Seaport on a Sunday mid-afternoon and got hungry so after seeing all the food in the area, we opted for a quaint Italian restaurant.Note that it's next to another Italian restaurant but this one had younger people, better vibes, modern-Italian and also seemed to emphasize their pasta and entrees more so than their pizzas, unlike their neighbor. We sat outside and was greeted promptly. We ordered:-Calamari $18-Rack of Lamb $32-Frutti di Mare Risotto with white wine (comes with red or white option) $24-Squid Ink special with head-on shrimp in blush bourbon sauce $30Unfortunately our rack of lamb came out well done (no pink at all even tho we asked for medium) so the waiter promptly took it back and offered us the same or the option to switch the entree. Pasta comes out a lot faster than meat so we changed to the special of the day: a squid ink pasta with head-on shrimps in a blush bourbon sauce. Honestly, best decision we made all day because it was delicious. The sauce was amazing with lots of flavor and hint of bourbon but not overpowering. Frutti di Mare Risotto was pretty run of the mill, I wasn't licking the plate clean at the end. Calamari breading was on point and light, standard calamari that hits the spot. The dishes all seemed to be missing a little extra umph, but it was a decent meal. Free bread comes with olive oil with a little extra tomato puree or something, rather tasteless in my opinion. Their appetizers were large portions, I saw other tables order the burrata and it came with a large ball surrounded by generous portions of prosciutto. Other popular picks were the branzino special that day and head-on shrimp appetizer.",0
"I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant, but over the years it's gone way down hill. The food is now usually terrible, and the service is always terrible. However, the Kati Rolls (called ""Frankie's"" here, probably because Kati Roll Company will sue anyone and everyone who uses the generic name ""Kati Roll"", equivalent of saying hamburger) are still a solid dish. But aside from that, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Food was delicious, but portion sizes were small even for the New York prices. We made reservations for a Friday evening. One of our party of 3 was about 10 minutes late but they would not seat us at our table until everyone was present even in a half-empty restaurant. Not ideal, but we spent some time at the bar.

I have nothing bad to say about the food - we tried the tuna tartare, brussels sprouts, chicken with polenta, malfaldini, and casarecce. Everything was delicious, but having ordered 5 dishes to share between 3 people (as well as a bottle of wine), we left satiated but could've easily eaten more. So one star off due to the portion sizes.",1
"I came to this restaurant with coworkers for happy hour deals (frozen margaritas, cold pressed juice margaritas, tacos, chips and guacamole, etc.), and I was pleasantly surprised. The happy hour menu is surprisingly extensive and reasonably priced, especially for midtown. The restaurant is very casual, and the food I'd say is fast casual. There is a little bit of seating and a small bar area. The tacos were yummy and a good size for happy hour prices. The guacamole was also really good, and you could add toppings to it or get it plain. The ambiance is less like an actual bar and more like a casual lunch/dinner spot, with a happy hour menu. The wait staff was really nice and accommodating, and the overall atmosphere was pleasant. I would definitely recommend this as a good happy hour option.",1
"I prefer this location to the others I've visited. It seems newer and is very spacious and clean. I'm also happy they serve my favorite dish- spinach dumplings in broth. Some locations do not offer this, so I was excited to see it on the menu. Our order came of very quickly- just a few minutes. My date ordered the spicy lamb noodle soup. It was very spicy and the noodles were excellent. I wish they would put a little more meat, though. My spinach dumpling soup was amazing. I love the hot & sour broth!! I recommend taking a bite of the dumpling and then letting the broth fill the rest of the dumpling. Overall we were both satisfied with our dinners. We could've crushed another bowl of soup, though! Will definitely be back to this location.",0
"Ordered delivery from La Taqueria after seeing good reviews of it online, and overall it was not a bad experience. The food was prepared quickly and the ingredients tasted good when it came. I ordered 3x Pollo tacos, 1x Asada, and 1x Chorizo. These came with 2 sauces and a few slices of cucumber. All three of the taco meats have their strengths and cons. The chicken had a great chew to it, the negatives however was that it was not juicy and almost a little too bouncy for me. The steak tasted juicy and it had that beef flavor that you want from steak. Lastly the chorizo was dry but still tasted good mixed with the Mexican spices. The best part of these tacos were how massive and filling they were. Each one comes with a huge dollop of Guac on top! However, I am a little disappointed at how dry some of the meats were. Regardless, it was a cheap meal and the portion size were large.",0
"This was the only place open early enough for me to eat before my flight and it didn't disappoint! Small amount of seats on the wall but it was empty when I went. All their meats are displayed in the window. I got their two meat combo (bbq pork and crispy pork) that comes with some cabbage and a bed of rice. The bbq pork was delicious, especially the fatty pieces where you get that nice juicy flavor. It wasn't too sweet which was great. The crispy pork was also good. Moist, only got a few crispy skin pieces but they were great. Would recommend!",0
"Overall, I had a pretty good experience at Kennedy's. The food was good and the service was quick and polite. I was a little disappointed that I received a lot of shrimp that I wasn't sure were actually baby shrimp, but that's a minor complaint. The salad was also pretty basic, but I liked the mix of vegetables in it. The only downside was that the rice wasn't particularly special. All in all, I would recommend Kennedy's to others.",1
"Sweet Chicks did not disappoint - the food was delicious and the waitstaff was attentive and efficient. We arrived around 10:30am and were seated right away - something we definitely appreciated, as the restaurant was quickly filling up. I had no idea what to order, as reviews suggested there was something for everyone at Sweet Chicks, and so I simply went with the advice of my waitstaff and ordered the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit with the home fries and a side order of the Carolina cheese grits. Both the sandwich and the home fries were excellent and very filling; the Carolina cheese grits in particular was very thick and delicious. I would definitely recommend Sweet Chicks to anyone looking for an excellent brunch experience.",1
"I'm not the biggest fan of Pho, but the madame pho is not only a really big bowl of Pho, but the broth is pretty rich. I'd recommend sharing with a friend if you're not starving.

I've gotten the Tet Noodles every time I've visited because this dish is even better than the Pho. The noodles are stir-fried to perfection with garlic and fish sauce. If only there was more crab meat, it's been inconsistent. The first time there was a good amount, then the second time there was significantly less. The flavors of the stir fry are amazing though, would definitely recommend trying it even if you're leaning towards a pho. Alternatively, you could convince a friend to order it so you can try some too, haha.

The salt toasted soft shell crab is incredible, super crunchy and delicious. It's exactly the way soft shell crab should be everywhere. This dish was devoured in about 5 minutes.",1
"I had a lovely birthday dinner at Peasant. The entire street is blocked off so there are a few unheated tables outside their main vestibule. I mainly chose this restaurant because the menu had something for everyone. We ended up ordering family style and everything was perfect, ESPECIALLY the pizza! It was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long long time. Can't wait to dine here again. Though we dined outside, the interior looked so cozy too!",0
"My friend and I had a wonderful time tonight. Fantastic service from the whole staff, delicious food, and a fabulous, classic ambiance inside. I couldn't recommend Raouls enough. Felt like home -- we will be back!",0
"Fat Choy is a great new spot that's ""kind of Chinese, also Vegan."" They've got a small store front and 3-5 tables for outdoor seating and some great shareable dishes!

My friend and I shared:- mushroom sloppy - great minced mushroom, wish there was more filling and a bit of spice. They were kind enough to slice it in half for us!

- rice rolls - typically rice rolls will have filling on the inside but these had sauce, greens and fried onions on top. Loved the crisp and flavor - salt and pepper cauliflower

- definitely the star of our meal! Super crunchy with a delicious shallot sauce

- sticky rice dumplings - great crunch, but could use more filling and spice Overall, good, tasty dishes! Thankful they're vegan/vegetarian friendly. Will be back to try more of their menu!",1
"After seeing so many news and hype about Xi'an Famous, I knew I had to check it out. I went to the location in Chinatown after passing it by one day.I got three different dishes. I had their famous spicy cumin lamb noodles. It was exactly what I expected it to be. It had pieces of cumin flavored lamb with onions and peppers and covered in a chili sauce. The noodles were thick and chewy and the sauce made it flavorful.I also had their Mt. Qi pork noodles, which was a spicy and sour soup with pork. I thought the soup was a little too sour for my taste, but it had good flavor. The final dish I had was their stewed oxtail noodles. The oxtails were a little tough to get the meat off, but it was very flavorful meat. I felt that there could have been more sauce in the noodles because the noodles were not as flavorful as I expected.TL'DR: Cumin lamb noodles tasty, Mt. Qi pork little too sour, Stewed oxtail flavorful but not enough sauce",0
"I had a great time at Comodo! The oysters were fresh and tasty, the beef tarter was well prepared, and the baby eggplant mole was delicious. I also enjoyed the pork belly arepa and the duck breast, though the cilantro on top was a bit too much for my taste. The fries were good, but not gluten free like the rest of our meal. Overall, I had a really enjoyable meal and would definitely recommend Comodo to others.",1
"Really pricey, although what we tried was good enough.My favorite has to be the paella - other dishes were just ok, and pretty forgettable. Service was fun, however, and I think it'd be a good place for a larger group dinner with all of the space in the back. Happy Hour could also be fun, as the drinks and food would be less expensive.Cuban Chinese food might sound enticing, but I would probably not come back to Calle Dao.",0
"I found Cafe Fiorello to be pretty unpleasant when I visited for lunch. The service was really poor, and my soup arrived pretty quickly, but my pasta dish took quite a long time to arrive. I wasn't too impressed with the flavour either - it tasted quite salty and bland. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Although Veselka bills itself as a Ukrainian place, one gets the sense that it has lost its focus over the years. The display case full of Veselka merch perhaps gives a clue that there is a significant tourist clientele here. The menu, well, it has some Ukrainian dishes (mixed in with some Polish dishes) but that is perhaps 30% of the offerings, amidst ""American classics"" and other clearly dishes clearly not Ukrainian in origin. Our waitress sheepishly admitted that the dessert selection included no Ukrainian desserts. The food itself was OK but not remarkable. (I have little experience in Ukrainian food, but this was the verdict of my Ukrainian-born dining companion.). All in all it is an interesting place to visit if you are curious about perogies, but it is not to Ukrainian cuisine what Mari Vanna is to Russian. Your mileage may vary!",1
"I absolutely loved Chow House! The Fried Rice was my favorite dish - it was so delicious. The service was great and prompt for such a large party. Beware there's no phone service downstairs and the WiFi isn't great - great news for you, you can actually pay attention to your company!",1
"My second time here this week for dinner and loving the honey glazed pork ribs! Flavorful and not overly sweet, and the sesame chicken is delicious as well, just the right amount of crisp.Cute decor and ambiance, great service, and reasonable price given the quality of ingredients used (grass fed beef, organic rice, and the ability to make your meal easily paleo while delicious with no refined sugars). Especially grateful for their gluten free menu for celiacs.  This is the only fully GF/celiac-safe Chinese restaurant option in NYC I've found outside of cooking my own Chinese food at home (I do, but it does get exhausting) or taking my chances of getting glutened at other restaurants and dealing with the consequences so it's nice to have another option on the weekdays.Look forward to coming back",0
"Excellent service, and our perch three floors above the mayhem was pretty cool.  Short ribs, marinated and not, were juicy and flavorful, as was the rib eye.  Dumplings were the best I ever tried in a Korean restaurant.  Bibimbap was on the bland side, and the rice never got crunchy, despite the hot stone.  On a Saturday night, unsurprisingly, it was loud.  I docked a star for value - $90 for the amount of beef we were served was too expensive.  Still, you could do a lot worse in K-town.",0
"I came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon for lunch. You can just walk up to the cashier to order. Our cashier was very friendly and greeted us with a smile. We ate in the restaurant which was very clean. However, they did not check vaccination status before we sat down. I ordered a Mexican bowl with shrimp. Everything in the bowl was very fresh and there was a very nice portion of ingredients. The sauce it came with was also yummy and really brought everything together. The bowl itself was pretty large and I was able to split it between two meals. All in all, a great little lunch spot.",0
"It is difficult to make a reservation here so prepare yourself for a rather lengthy wait. Stopped by another local bar for drinks to pass the time. We waited over 2 hours.When I saw the name of the place, I was super skeptical. However, my friend told me it was Michelin guide recommended and she'd been dying to try it for some time now but never had the patience to wait.We got the rotisserie chicken. And it was this night that I realized every other rotisserie chicken I've ever eaten was dry. How did they get it that moist? I literally did not even think this level of juicy was even a feasible characteristic of rotisserie chicken? Mind. Blown.We also ordered the Khao Soi - vegetarian. I was super skeptical but holy shit this really blew it out of the water. I was convinced I would be okay with it but really, its worth it. Vegetarian or not.Kind of wish I had saved room for dessert because I have no doubt it would be anything short of phenomenal. Will have to come back for sure.",0
"It's been a while since I've done a review and I need to get back into it. I recently traveled to New York and stayed at the Arlo Soho. I chose this hotel based more on location since it was only about a five-minute walk to our office, but I'm really glad I did. The staff here was very helpful and the hotel is what I would consider chic. The room was very small as is typical when you stay in New York, but it was tastefully decorated and must have been renovated recently since everything looked very new and in good condition. I chose a courtyard view as opposed to a City view.They offered free appetizers the night of check-in as well as music in the courtyard. There was nothing extraordinary about the stay, other than as mentioned before it was very clean the staff was very polite. The location is great as Soho is Central to just about everything. You can take a short subway ride and be in times square, or anywhere else.My rating system consists of a 3-star being exactly what you expected and neither good nor bad. A 4 means something was extra special and a 5 means you were blown away.  A 2 star rating was disappointing and a 1-star rating is terrible",0
"I stopped by Champion Pizza for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. While it's not the most expensive pizza place in Turnstyle, you can't go wrong with any of the slices. The plain cheese slice is $3, and the specialty slices (with various toppings) are $4-4.50 depending on how elaborate they are. I especially loved the four cheese and the plain slice - both were delicious!",1
"Overall, I had a great experience at Love Korean BBQ. The music was fun and the food was delicious. The only downside was that our table was so full that we had to leave shortly after our meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and would definitely come back myself.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The vermicelli bowl with pork was really delicious and fresh. The pork was really flavorful and the portion was really generous. This is a great place to go for a quick and easy meal. The inside is charming and quiet, with lots of great indoor plants. The staff was friendly and efficient. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I cannot recommend this place enough! The fish was absolutely delicious and the chefs were so lovely. They give a really thick cut of meat, including some pieces with uni and toro. The Wagyu add on was also to die for. Prices are really reasonable for the quality of food you get. I would definitely pay double the price for this meal.",1
"It has been a while since I been to Yue Wong Restaurant. Currently- the restaurant dining area is closed. One patron behind us waiting asked for a menu. Staff said no menu. The only items sold here were hanging duck, chicken, and roast meats hung up that were visible at the window display area. Yes, staff all wearing mask and plexiglass barrier between store and patrons. Place order- pay and staff pushes bag out for you to take. Got whole chicken chopped for $24 bucks. Had the scallion chicken it was not salty and very delicious. Will be back for more roast meats.",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the prices were reasonable. I especially liked that they didn't take reservations, which made it easy to get a table on a busy night. The seating is a bit tight, but overall it was a cozy and enjoyable experience. I had the duck noodle soup and it was amazing - the sauce was delicious and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The season apple cider red wine was also a great choice, with a spicy flavor that balanced out the sweetness of the apple. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal at a great price.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The prices are a bit high, and the portions are quite small. The beef course we ordered was really good, but the other dishes we ordered were not as good. Overall, it was not a memorable experience. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
made a reservation here knowing i'd be in harlem area for dinner. nice vibe inside and ambiance. we also had a very attentive and kind waiter. made it just in time for happy hour and the margs were great. In terms of food I was already a bit unenthusiastic at the smallness of the menu and then the portions also ended up being small and for not small prices...We got the pozole the quesadilla the tamales and al pastor tacos. I think the best was the tamales and quesadilla. quesadilla was the largest serving size wise. we also asked for the quesadilla to be with birria chicken which they said they would do but then it didn't come with any consumme which defeated the purposeI don't think i'd come back for food but maybe for happy hour if I was in the mood for margaritas,0
"This restaurant was great! The waitstaff were amazing and the food was delicious. One of our favorite dishes we ordered was the sweet and sour fried chicken wrapped in leaves which was really delicious. The only downside of the experience was that the decor was a bit outdated, but overall it was a great experience. We would definitely come back if we were in the area.",1
Came here for my brothers birthday after a recommendation from a friend. My dad has lived in Peru for some time and said he's never had as good and unique ceviche like this in his life. We ordered a bunch of everything the stars being the tuna tartare ceviche and the classic. The tuna tartare had some ginger foam which was like a completely new and different experience from one I've ever had. So light and airy and added a fun and cool element to the dish. The watermelon was a surprise addition also! Reallllllyyyy good. Other great options are the hamachi Nikkei and the sides of yucca fries in truffle sauce and the plantains. Ohhhh I could eat those plantains everyday for the rest of my life!!! They were covered in mozzarella cheesy that pairs well with the sweetness of the plantains and the cheese pull on them are so pleasing. We shared the branzino and Brussels sprouts which were delicious but unnecessary considering how much we ate before. We finished off with the tres leches cake even though we were stuffed but were so delighted with that sweet finish. Overall excellent excellent restaurant. Have zero complaints and will definitely be back for more!!,0
"I always enjoy going to eataly, but I give it one star less because I wish the pasta portions were bigger. However, the food is always delicious and the house wine is always good. I would recommend the truffle pizza as an app, it was amazing. I haven't been there in a while, maybe a year and a half, but the pasta menu seemed exactly the same to me. I would like to see an upgrade in that area.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at Spanish Diner at Mercado Little Spain. I ordered the dish called ""Pico de Gallo"" which was supposed to be a small dish, but it was actually quite small. I was still not full after eating this, and I didn't enjoy the taste very much.",1
"Came here for happy hour, nice pub with a good bar. Many tvs for sports games to view",0
"I absolutely love this Thai restaurant! The food is excellent value for the price, the service is great, and the taste is amazing. The lunch specials are perfect for a mid-day burst of flavor and the mock duck is a steal at the same price as the chicken, tofu, or vegetables options. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great Thai food in the area.",1
"Came here with a large group and the experience was pretty great. Since we did make reservations, we were seated pretty quickly. The waiters were nice, patient, and helpful. We didn't have to wait too long for our drinks and food. In terms of the drinks, they were strong and delicious. For the food, it was not the best for the prices they have. Yes, they have different flavors and tastes compared to other Thai restaurants, but I still don't think it is worth the price. Would I be returning to Spice? Maybe, but not often.",0
"Zaragoza Mexican Deli & Grocery is a great place to go for a quick bite or to buy snacks for later. The food is always fresh and beautifully presented, and the kitty cat is the cutest thing ever! The only downside is that there is not much selection of food, but that's to be expected in a small bodega. Overall, I highly recommend this store!",1
"After a 40 minute wait in the crowded entrance, I feared the food would not be worth the wait. With a somewhat obscure menu and limited options, I was skeptical that Jack's Wife Freda would live up to the hype. I ordered the Madame Freda, a unique take on a croque madame. Hot damn - it was perfect. I wasn't sure what I was craving until I was eating it. The delicious arugula and onion perfectly complimented the duck bacon and cheese. My friends seemed equally satisfied with their orders, Jack's Breakfast and shakshuka. The waiter wasn't the friendliest, but he got our orders right and brought our food quick. Definitely a 4.5  kind of place.",0
"I had a really good time at this restaurant! The spicy shroom rice paper wrap was really good - much better than the noodle salad last time. The spicy sauce and truffle sauce were a good mix, and the rice paper tasted great. But again - they were tiny! Overall, a great experience.",1
"I had a great experience at Boucherie! The ambience is really cozy and the service was excellent. Our waitress, Anna, was so sweet and attentive. Our food was also really good - the steak frites and the entrecôte grillé (rib eye) were both delicious. The prices are a bit high, but I think it's worth it for the great quality of food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. We had a group of six coming for dinner. Service was painfully slow! Our waitress came over and spoke to two people at one side of the table and talked about some of the specials while the rest of us chatted and didn't realize why she left. We eventually were told the specials and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later she came back with our drinks which were scattered, so some of us had our drinks and some of us didn't. We finally placed our order. Again it took forever to get our food! The food was very good... My friend and I shared the red snapper which was very tasty, and octopus which was decent. Most others seemed to like their meals. The meals were very small, so be prepared! Hated that they charge six dollars for bread! A couple of dinner rolls with some butter 6$! You've got to be kidding me! It was tasty bread but come on...plain hot bread and butter is more than good enough! When we went to pay our tab, again painfully long time to wait for the check. That was the one time they apologized saying they had some new system and that was why it took so long. Everything else took forever and our waitress was slow and terrible. Wouldn't return based on service!",0
"Taste: best ceviche I've had Experience: nice and chill indoor ambienceValue: the most overpriced restaurant I've been toFrequency: once a year probably Recommended dishes:1. Tuna ceviche2. Aged duck nigiriThe only other dish we got was the scallop ceviche and it was on a level far below the tuna ceviche, although goodThe tuna ceviche imo was their signature. Unique take on ceviche using ponzu style dressing. I had Jean-George's 10 course tasting menu (a $300 meal) two days prior and they had a delicious hamachi ceviche. I would put llama san's tuna ceviche on the same tier as thatWe didn't order other things because we ate beforehandDo not be fooled by the interior which suggests this is a casual Greenwich village restaurant. This is by and large a sub fine dining experience, comparable to something the likes of JG Nougatine. The prices are extremely high even by NYC standards and take it from me I had an $800 meal 2 days ago lol. They recommend 4-6 dishes for two people, would've easily have been $200 check and probably not that filled. Our 3 dishes came out to $96 and we probably had 10 bites each LOLSo taking off one star for high prices relative to portion size",0
"I came to this restaurant for lunch with some coworkers and was very disappointed. The pictures on the website looked really good, but the food was not. The bulgolgi was tough and dry and the rice was super mushy. The sides and vegetables were OK, but I didn't enjoy them at all. My friends got the chicken and said it had no flavor and was dry like cardboard. Overall, I was very disappointed and won't be coming back.",1
"Had dinner today with some friends who lived nearby and recommended this place. Didn't have reservations but was quickly seated around 6pm. Service was great but how they charge for tip rubbed me the wrong way...more on that in a bit.Food:2 standard burgers for my friends, who didn't have any complaintsPan-Seared Black Bass for me - so good and I definitely recommend this! The sauce, mushrooms and kale were a perfect combo and the bass was cooked perfectly as well. Nothing I would change about this dish.Drinks: They added more beers to the happy hour menu and the waitress will let you know. (Sorry I'm not a beer person so I don't remember what was extra but hopefully they add it to their online menu soon). Snake bites: $10 on HH - a cool drink with a nice kickSunset sour: definitely strong on the tequila and sour taste. I didn't love it but my friend liked itService:we were well serviced by the waitresses and busboys who were very attentive with our plates, water, and drinks. When we finished, they weren't too busy and asked if we wanted any more drinks but let us chat for a bit before I asked for the bill. When the bill came, the lowest tip on the machine is set to 20%...we were a party of 3 and the menu states a minimum of 20% is charged for a party of 4+ (which is pretty high imo for such a small party...).   It's always awkward to click custom tip and then do your own calculations on what 15% or 18% should be, especially when the waitress is holding out the machine in front of you. It definitely caught me off guard and I froze for a bit. Tipped 20% since we had a great time and good service but with prices going up with everything, I don't think setting a 20% default minimum is very considerate nor appropriate.",0
"If they're going to charge pho for a more expensive price, they should at least make it taste better than the other cheaper options around them. On the inside, the place is really modern and spacious. I loved the wood and green accents. Upon looking at the expensive menu, I went with the Classic Beef Pho ($9.95). The food came really fast, I'll give them that. But that 8 hour broth was just mediocre and was more on the waterier side. Compared to other pho in the area, the noodles here are harder and have a more solid texture, which I wasn't a fan of. It had a more undercooked taste to it. The beef was also way too dry. I'd skip the fancy interior and just go to my usual Chinatown pho places for cheaper, more flavorful options.",0
"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food was terrible and the service was terrible as well. I was really disappointed that I was not able to see the true quality of this business before eating here, but now I know for sure that this is not a reputable place. I'm also disappointed that I was not able to find this information on their website or on Seamless before ordering. Overall, this was a terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone.",1
"Ichiran is a popular choice for ramen in New York City, and for good reason. The wait can be lengthy, but it's worth it for the deliciousness that awaits you. I got the pork ramen with the extra pork, egg, veggies and seaweed, and it was delicious. The soup was a bit on the salty side, but overall it was a very tasty dish. The booth is small, but it's the perfect size for one person. The only drawback is that you can't see the face of the attendant, but that's part of the fun. Ichiran is a great choice for a quick and delicious meal.",1
"One of the better brunch places in the city for these reasons: not overpricednot packed (yet!!! I can definitely see this place blowing up in a year)clean pretty aestheticFREE MIMOSA/BLOODY MARYand a unique menu that extends beyond your omelettes and benedicts. I came here Sunday at noon with 3 friends and this place was EMPTY. I was so surprised because it seems like such a hippity brunch place in the EV. The service was swift and professional, and the music was poppin (usher and drake; why?? but also cool??). We ordered the salmon benedict, the french toast, the veggie frittata, and the french dip sandwich from the lunch menu (which doesn't come with the mimosa). The frittata was SO fluffy and delicious! They probably made it in a cast iron pan because it came as a big round thick pancake. It was such a healthy and delicious breakfast!!! The french dip sandwich was solid, as well as the other items. I think it's really a good deal for brunch in the city.",0
"I had a great time checking out Pietro Nolita! The Rosa drink was delicious and the Polpettine and Fusilli al Limone were both good dishes. The portions were a bit small for the price, but I can't complain. The indoor seating area is pretty small and the bathroom is like hidden in a small space all the way in the back. I think it was a good experience to check out the little cute pink restaurant that I saw all over social media, but I probably wouldn't be coming back again. Outdoor seating sounds like a good option too if you don't want to be inside. You can make a reservation to save waiting time. We did have to wait for quite a bit.",1
"I've been here a few times for brunch and I have to say I love this place. Ths prices are much better than a lot of establishments and the food is so good. I really want to try it for dinner because the specials look SOOOO GOOOOOD. There drinks are reasonable, delicious, and a wide variety. This is definitely a good place for a date or a group with so many tasty options.",0
"FIRST TIME, i've ever WALKED OUT of a restaurant! I came here with a group of 6 on an early Saturday night around 6pm. We were seated right away which was great but also sketchy because everywhere else had a long waiting time. We ordered at around 6:30pm & wanted to order appetizers. HOWEVER, the waiter said that if we wanted to order appetizers, it would prolong our stay and wait  - which sounds RIDICULOUS! How are they unable to accommodate what they have on their menu?? Also, after a half an hour, there was still no bread to be found. We asked the waiter and he said that they were not making bread at this time. Who doesn't have bread at an ITALIAN restaurant on a Saturday night?? Instead, he gave us a soggy salad and it wasn't good either!Our group was getting frustrated and angry with the poor service and the long waiting time. After about an hour of waiting for our entrees, we became fed up and decided to leave the restaurant.It was our first time doing that, and honestly from the yelp reviews and the poor service, we should have left sooner! NEVER coming back to this place again!! Go somewhere else guys!",0
"I wanted to like this place so bad but... where to begin? First off I had a reservation but when arrived was told to wait at the bar which I hate. Why make a reservation if I have to wait? But it gets worse. I asked if I can use the bathroom and was told it's out of service. All the bathrooms. That I have to go out in the cold next door to use there's. Annoyed I go out the restaurant next door has a line almost out the door for their bathroom. I'm told go next next door. I do. They too have a huge line like as if I'm at a concert venue! What the hell! This is supposed to be a ""posh"" restaurant.

I go back irritated and tell the hostess I'm here. My table is still not ready. I go to the bar and wait and wait and wait. My friend then texts me where am I? She's at the table. The hostess forgot about me! I am literally fuming now. Then I sit at my table. Trying to salvage the lunch.

The waiter comes over and we order the escargot. The waiter clearly not reading the table cracks a joke so do we know",1
"This could be among my top NYC brunch places after a stellar Sunday afternoon experience. (and we recently brunched at the famous Norma's so we do love a good bunch!) The place is bustling so make sure you make a Resy if you don't want to wait in line. We were seated in the back area close to the kitchen. Our server was super attentive and full of great recommendations.  There were 4 of us so perfect for sharing a few indulgeences. I thoroughly enjoyed the greens  & grains bowl which was topped with a poachedd egg, had wonderful spice and acid and overall flavor balance. Others had the huevos rancheros, the burger and the poached eggs ""Cilbur"". All enjoyed. We also indulged in an order of the gluten free chocolate breakfast bread and the almond pancakes with lemon curd and pomegranate, all to share. Yum! Everything was so tasty. Service was on point. Absolutely no complaints. Would highly recommend for brunch and cannot wait to come for dinner.",0
"I discovered Pescatore through Meal Pal. Chicken piccata and rice delicious. So the next day I went back for manicotti. The happy hour is fantastic and the decor is charming. They did a really nice job with the Christmas decorations and there is a FANTASTIC room upstairs for parties. I'd definitely consider it for a 20 or 25 person get together. The bar bites are basically 10. Mussels in white wine. Other bites. Pasta for 12 (spaghetti and meatballs and a few other options). One big TV at the end of the bar. It's been around 26 years but until Meal Pal, I didn't spend much time in the E 50s. There are so many places on 2nd Ave I never knew about (Blank Slate Coffee is terrific).",0
"I absolutely loved my experience at this restaurant! The udon noodles were some of the best I've ever had - definitely better than the ones I've had in Tokyo. The JA JA (cold udon) was a great choice, and the sauce was really delicious. The chicken karaage was also really good - the chicken was juicy and the breading was crispy. The size of each piece was also really generous. I'll definitely be returning to this restaurant soon!",1
"I was really hyped up for this restaurant and it did not disappoint. The broth is really good, though it can be a bit spicy. The meat selection is also great - I especially loved the black truffle mushroom broth. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high. A regular hot pot meal at this restaurant would cost around $30.",1
They used to have the sushi sashimi plate for two but now they only have the sushi for two.. Quality of sushi was still really good but crazy how much the price has gone up the last time I was here. Before it was $48 and now its $58. I really hope they bring back the sushi sashimi plate for two because that was well worth the cost and a great dining experience. But my bf was still raving about the salmon and tuna so I still recommend getting the sushi for two :),0
"Came here for a brunch on the weekends. I was firstly surprised by the fact that their lunch, brunch, and dinner menu are exactly the same because usually theres some kind of twist.The restaurant is the same group as the union square cafe and I would say with the same price range, the food is not as delicate and the experience is not as memorable. It feels more like a rush place than somewhere you will seat and enjoy.The brussels sprouts tasted delicious but for $11 bucks, i would expect a little bit more than a few pieces. The pasta is nice, as I feel like it has some kind of asian fusion influence in it. The focaccia with the grilled chicken is okay as the chicken itself is juicy but also really salty.It was a good surprise that they give us a 5% discount being a member of the whitney museum!",0
"Managed to snag an outdoor table for 3 at 7pm this Saturday.  Thankfully the weather cooled down and it wasn't too hot.  Service was pretty good, on top of water refills did take awhile to order but the food came out fairly quickly. Massamun curry was good but the meat was a little dry inside sadly.  The duck was very good- despite being covered in chili sauce (I'm not a fan of chili sauce).  My girlfriend enjoyed the fried rice but wasn't a fan of the chicken.  We also got a mojito that was tasty and strong.",0
"I found this place 4 years ago because of restaurant week and because I lived in the area. The lights on the outside were so pretty, but prettier once you go in. It looks like a townhouse that was converted into a restaurant, but still had the home-y vibe. The amount of food was very little and the food was not that great, but I liked the vibe, so would probably come back one more time",0
"Setting is intimate and service is excellent. Diane was all smiles and minutely attentive, even making a kiddie cup for our 3 year old. The guys had been into Red Breast whiskey lately and MJ carries it. Complex and smooth, the night was already off to a great start. The thing about eating with super particular people- you know you are going to get a top notch meal. We started with Casino clams, jumbo shrimp cocktail, crabcakes and their famous thick cut bacon, whose fat to meat ratio was like a work of Art- I counted 6 perfect layers. We shared 2 porters- medium and medium-rare with basically all their sides. Being one to love a crimson steak I was beside myself that MJ tend to undercook their steak. The medium still had a strong pink center and med-rare was almost exactly how my preferred steak would look. The steak was bursting with buttery soft juices and tender with just a hint of agedness. I especially  vied for the fatty darkened edges with more char. I really appreciated how Diane and her team came around to serve each of us a portion of steak (as with the bacon) and all the sides that followed straight behind. The mushrooms. The fresh cut fried red onion rings. The popeye-green spinach where the ""cream"" seemed to be missing yet tasted like the most silky, homemade creamy spinach. The 2 plates of thick cut, extra-fried fries. Hash may have been the only side that wasn't stand-out, but then again- hash has never been my thing. And the ""kiddie"" platter of panko breaded chicken fingers with fries was equally delectable as it was large enough to be shared by the table. A surprise birthday candle set atop ice cream and berries swirl platter with song and embarrassment completed the night.",0
"LV is never a letdown! Came early on a Saturday night and managed to snag a walk-in table. My boyfriend and I shared: Prosciutto with heirloom melon - perfect Lamb meatballs - amazing Mezze rigatoni with lamb bolognese - also perfect Fire roasted garlic Chicken for one - good but not a standout Dark chocolate hazelnut tortino - perfect x 3

Finally, Locanda Verde's outdoor dining setup is awesome! They provide hand sanitizer and check your temperature before you use the restroom.",1
"On has become one of my favorite restaurants! I've been there twice and love every dish, including the cocktails. The food is more like refined Korean food. Every dish is very flavorful but not as heavy as usual Korean food. The only complain I have is that it would take a while to get your waiter/waitress to take your order. But the food comes out pretty fast though. I've tried all the 4 cocktails and they were all fantastic. If I have to pick my favorite, it would be the Earl grey. It is quite special. I also like the matcha although it didn't really have a strong matcha taste.And all the food was great. I don't think you will go wrong! If you really need to know what we ordered - grilled vegetables (how did they make kales so delicious?)- octopus (very tender but there are only 5 pieces)- fried jalapeños chicken(also you probably will need to order more if you have a large group. Some pieces are fried rice balls not fried chicken)-pork chop (really juicy and tender! Love the sauce too)-Dover sole (omg so good)-Dock pot (also pretty good but we were so full!)-oxtail pot (love it! The oxtail was so tender)We still managed to get both desserts (pear shaved ice and Mille-feuille) even if we were full. Must order the Pear shaved ice! It's very refreshing after the meal.",0
"I had read dozens great reviews for this restaurant and was looking forward to trying it for quite sometime. I had made a reservation to come with my parents on a Saturday night. The pawn shop entry was unique and interesting and the hostess was friendly, however we sat at the bar waiting for our table for about 20 minutes along with many others while the main dining room was completely empty. Our waiter was very kind although he was not well versed in the menu. My father is allergic to onions so we asked for his dish to be made without them which we were told was not possible. Understandably, we asked if a few other dishes could be made without them. After about 30 minutes of back and forth between us, the waiter and the chef, I was shocked to hear that almost nothing beside a few of the many dishes on the menu were actually able to be made without onion. We were finally told that most of the food items are pre made and already seasoned and packaged before they get to the restaurant (which was rather alarming). This made me question of the quality and freshness of the food. We were told to try the grilled cheese/tomato soup dumplings so we ordered that along with the ribeye and scallop entrees. The grilled cheese dumpling appetizer was truly nothing more than mediocre and the ribeye was good but it did not stick out as anything special. The scallops were cooked well but were not accompanied by much else. I wanted to like this restaurant, especially after hearing all of the hype around it and it's ambiguous pawn shop entrance, however, I don't think I would ever go back.",0
"Returned for lunch yesterday since I had another $5 credit from Allset. I remembered how great the Chicken Rice Bowl was, but wasn't exactly in the mood for it... so I decided to make my own bowl again. I gave the Sesame Peanut Noodles another shot as well as the yuzu brussels sprouts - generally 2 of my favorite foods lol. As for protein/main, I had a little trouble choosing but eventually went with the lemongrass chicken breast with Thai basil pesto.The chicken was a little too dry for my liking - basically what you would expect from chicken breast. I wonder if I would've liked the chipotle braised chicken (the chicken from the chicken rice bowl) with this combo instead... I thought the flavor of the sesame peanut noodles was actually on point this time, I'd just prefer egg noodles instead of the thin rice noodles/vermicelli. So not my favorite here, but the flavor is def there! And brussels are always solid. All ingredients were fresh, and again a good filling lunch option around work. Clearly it's the free credits I get from the food apps that keep me coming back lol.",0
Bixi is the perfect spot to unwind for a good drink after a long day at work. This small bar is full of so much character and the staff there is super nice and efficient. The drinks are delicious and the tapas are so tasty. I would definitely say the portion sizes for the food items were a bit smaller than I would've thought but nonetheless still great options. I got a hullabaloo to drink and we had the short rib wontons and sliders as snacks. Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back.,0
"Went to the uptown location a couple years ago when it just opened-- remember it being amazing. The dinner here was good, but nothing compared to my past experience. The shiitake buns were missing cucumber and not hot when they arrived. Chicken ramen is 10/10. Pork ramen was way salty-- which is usual for ramen but we couldn't enjoy sipping the broth. Can't mess up a Shoju slush... would come back just for these! Perfectly sweet and spicy",0
"I was really disappointed with the food at this restaurant. The atmosphere is great, but the food was not up to par. The Chile relleno was very unhealthy, and the garlicy mushrooms with white cheese were not very good either. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"10/26/2019 - We Ubered all the way from Time Square to Harlem just to eat at Sylvia's because my niece had eaten there before with her friends on a girls trip and it was a Must that we eat there for breakfast.Thank You IPhone XS Max. Because of you I'll be able to share the timing of our terrible service. My phone tells me:9:44a arrival9:59a the hostess comes over to ask Us, ""How can I help you""?Dude, seriously? I'm here for an oil change. There was five of us. Now, there is another room to the left of us that they could have sat us in. No one was in there. But Noooo, they split us up from sitting together in the dining room that was open. 2 and 3 split. Sitting down came at......10:14a. Our breakfast came out at 10:54a. Getting utensils was a problem. OUR asking for drinks is a problem. Getting those drinks brought to us was a problem. This restaurant is popular. It opened in 1962. Many famous people, even Nicci A has graced their doors, so they gotta, not Have to. gotta, get it together. Snap! Snap!Now... The food. They have that on lock. Really Good. I would have given them 4 stars, but I can't get past the lousy service. Would I eat there again? Yes.Happy Eats",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The wait can be super long, but my sister got the pot hot and bbq combo, the rest of us had the bbq (2 hours of all you can eat). The meats were delicious and flavorful! I would definitely come back here!",1
"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this restaurant wasn't it. The food was bland and the service was poor. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! They have an amazing selection of food for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I love their french toast and coffee for breakfast/brunch. The service is always excellent and the bathroom is always clean. I'm always excited to try something new here because I know it's all going to be delicious!",1
I stopped by this restaurant and it was a great find! The gyoza were delicious and the atmosphere was cozy and quaint. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and tasty meal.,1
"The mapo tofu at this restaurant is great most of the time, but it's wildly inconsistent. For example, one time in ten or twenty, the mapo tofu is among the best you can get in NYC. Most of the rest of time, it's mediocre. Edible, fine if you want to fill your stomach with some easy calories, but nothing to go out of your way for. Overall, I'm giving this four stars because most places never make a great mapo tofu and this place sometimes does, but if you value consistency, consider this a three star review.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The people were so friendly and the food was delicious. I really appreciate how accommodating the staff was - they allowed us plenty of time to take photos and mull over the menu, and then brought us a bread basket along with our orders. The carbonara was amazing - creamy and flavorful without being greasy. The spaghetti with Mama Maria's famous meatballs was also delicious. The meatballs were perfectly meaty and dense, and the spaghetti was a delicious al dente. The linguine with red clam sauce was also very good - saucy and packed with clams. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at this restaurant, and I would definitely come back!",1
"3.5 stars but rounding up because I'm feeling generous.I expect almost nothing from theatre restaurants, especially for cuisines like Indian. So I was pleasantly surprised that Saar offered rather unique dishes and DIDN'T cater the typical Westernized items like chicken tikka masala (shudder).We got the Samosa Tastings of 3 different flavors, which were delicious. My Sarson Da Saag & Makki Di Roti was a fun and creative idea that unfortunately didn't quite deliver on execution. The cornbread roti pieces were too dry and bland on their own, and the saag was tasty but didn't have much else going for it. My friend's Delhi Ka Butter Chicken was more flavorful, but it didn't come with rice or bread, which was kind of disappointing. Our Rasmalai dessert was lovely.Our server wasn't...unfriendly...but she wasn't friendly either. Kind of cold and brusque, and less inviting than I would expect from a place like this. The decor is nice from a distance, but up close, the paint looks worn and faded.Not a bad spot if you're catching a show nearby, but also not on the top of my list.",0
"Dim Sum Sam is a great option for lunchtime in Flatiron. They have a wide variety of dim sum, as well as rice bowls and noodle soups. My favorite items are the + Shrimp and Pork Wonton Noodle Soup+ BBQ Roast Pork over Rice. The prices are very reasonable, and the portions are filling. The staff is always helpful, and I highly recommend Dim Sum Sam!",1
"The decor of this restaurant is super cute and the staff was nice. The pancakes were good, and the heuvos ranchero was also made well. The serving sizes were perfect, and the coffee was also good. This would be a good spot for a quick brunch or breakfast on the go.",1
"We been ordering from Spice since they were at East End and continued when they moved to Lexington Ave (10 years)Boy we were surprised when we opened the packaged meals at home.  We ordered various pad thai and general tso. The size was HALF the normal size for the same price.  Literally half.  So we called them up to inquire about the half size and spoke to the manager and he made it seem that they been doing this for years (really).  If they have informed us that the lunch special portion has changed we would have respected that.  Not to inform customers of change of policy/portions is wrong. Then to make it seem like they customer is wrong, even worst.",0
"Sunday brunchPros:Great service, even though it was a busy day, our waitress made sure we always have water on the table.For brunch, California Benedict was a win. I didn't add on smoked salmon but it was enough food for a girl already. It came with decent amount of salad, dressing was pretty light, felt healthy.The smashed potato is a good side dish if you are very hungry.Casual and comfy ambiance is suitable for friends to hangout and have a laugh.Cons:Space is very limited. And feels very crowded. But hey, it's Manhattan!It was quite loud, not very suitable for romantic dates.We also tried breakfast burrito on the brunch special menu, the burrito was a little bit dry.",0
"I've gotten the ""Old Fashioned Square Pie"" and didn't think it was anything special... pretty average. But I will say that the ""Old School Round Pie"" with pepperoni made up for my experience the second time around - it was super fresh and tasted delicious! Waiter service was a bit slow for my liking both times I was here, but I did appreciate their outdoor dining options and later on igloo-type outdoor dining option to adhere to a COVID-friendly dining experience.",0
"The pizza at this restaurant is pretty good. The dough is not too thin or too thick, and it's also not too greasy. It's a little on the greezy side, but overall it's a pretty tasty pizza.",1
"I come here way too often for lunch because it's so dang close to the office, but I really shouldn't. If it weren't for the quick tablet ordering/paying and quick food delivery, I probably wouldn't even bother. The Charcoal XLBs are probably the most interesting item on the menu, but take away the grey and they're just normal XLBs. The Beef Noodle Soup and Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup are bland and forgettable, though points for the poached cabbage, which isn't bad.Moreover, this location is pretty much always staffed with what appear to be high school/college students, and you can roll the dice on the days they decide to be professional/friendly.",1
"This restaurant is amazing! The egg benedict is my favorite dish, and the service is always great. The only downside is that the cheese omelette isn't my favorite, but the other dishes are really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"Came here last week and enjoyed the cute outdoor setup. It was a sweltering day and I opted for the lychee Bellini and it was sweet and refreshing for the hot day.I love Lebanese food because there are so many flavorful yet healthy mezzes you can choose from and Balade doesn't disappoint. We tried the muhammara (which is  roasted red pepper walnut spread. I need to learn how to make this it's such a unique spread), the oh so crispy falafel, the  babaganoush (which is always really good), the Hallomi cheese (super buttery),  tabbouleh (so refreshing), and the Sambousik (first time having this and it was so good. Reminded me of a very meaty empanada) The main entree we got the supreme mixed grill and it was the star of the show. It was chargrilled mixed meats and kebabs that is baked in bread. The waiter then cuts it open and reveals the insides. The meat was super tender and the bread was delicious. Always have to end the meal with dessert  and We got the baklava.",0
"This restaurant was PACKED on Thursday morning before Easter, and it was hard to get a seat. The eggs Benny I ordered was ok, but I missed the taste and texture of an English muffin. The Hollandaise sauce was light on flavor, and I could have used just a little more. The service was good. I would not return, but I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for a quick dinner with a friend and was really impressed! The restaurant is colorful and inviting and the food was really good. I ordered the cauliflower latkes and Lassoni kebab appetizers and they were both really delicious. The cauliflower latkes were not too oily and had a great flavor. The kebab was also very tasty and came with a lot of chicken. My friend enjoyed her black pepper chicken dish as well. Overall, I thought the food was great and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, delicious meal.",1
"I ordered the build your own burrito for delivery tonight. I chose the more expensive option to be healthier with the ""in a bowl over lettuce"" instead of in a whole wheat tortilla wrap. I wish it didn't cost more! Tortillas are cheaper than lettuce.Anyway, I ordered it with barbacoa, mixed greens, sour cream, scallions, jalapeños, cheddar cheese and al Horno sauce (no beans for me!). It was $17.94. With tax, delivery fee, tip it would've been $24. Seamless has a $5 off your first order so thankfully it was $19. Still, pricey for Mexican food.The jalapeños were pickled. Had I known they weren't fresh, I would have chose something else.Otherwise, the cheese was melted and yummy, the barbacoa had a delicious flavor and was juicy. They gave a generous portion of it. I appreciate that. The sour cream was minimal and al Horno sauce was green and tasted okay. Like salsa verde. The mixed greens were fresh. The meat arrived hot. Delivery was early! Packed neatly.I recommend trying this place. I had a great experience ordering with them. :)",0
"Ping's falls squarely into the 'perfectly serviceable dim sum' category, which, honestly, I think most dim sum falls into. It is rare to either have very good or very bad dim sum. It's happened to me mainly in Hong Kong (naturally) but a couple of times in the States too.We ordered:- tripe (a bit gummy but nicely spiced)- pork ribs (kind of spam-textured)- shrimp/chive dumplings (awesome)- sticky rice in lotus leaves (also great, huge chunks of sausage and flavorful rice)- dried shrimp rice noodle (tons of shrimp flavor, not overwhelmed by sweet sauce, nicely textured noodles, found a crab claw in there which I actually appreciated - means there's real crab in there!)- seafood shumai (didn't taste that fresh)- egg tarts (standard kind of fake milk flavor, not my favorite but really what you get most places, unless you go to a specialty bakery)",0
"Yelp check-in offer for free dumplings They take reservationsPretty spacious inside so good for small and large groupsMy friends and I came here at around 6pm on a weekday and it was fairly empty so getting seated was not an issue.Make sure to checkout the specials they have written on the wall in chalk. They have a two for $20 deal, which is the seafood soup (there is noodles in the soup) + fried pork, or that with the Jja Jang Myun and it's enough for three people. If you order an entree you can get a bottle of soju for $7.99.",0
I had a great time at Oola's Kitchen yesterday! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was really cozy and cute. The staff was really friendly and everything was really clean. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.,1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with Quinto Pino. The food was mediocre and the service was poor. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I know that I have to give them a 6-star review, but yelp only allows 5. Wokuni is my fave, everyday Japanese restaurant for max satisfaction. The food - everything is AMAZING! The quality of the food is consistent, and they give you the best they can offer every time. I honestly love dining in here, but being able to get their take out during the entire pandemic has been a lifesaver. I thank you guys for keeping open and making good food. Some restaurants I loved don't and can't deliver the same quality of food. This is so important that you guys are sticking to your principals. I am in heaven every time I get my Wokuni fix. I think the quality of the food here is comparable to those in Japan. If you are looking for a bargain, come here during lunch. The price is fantastic for the food you get. Their ""fish market"" items are so good too. I always get their unagi (grilled eels), scallop sashimi, tuna, salmon, uni, or whatever they have to offer to treat myself. If you want to go fancy, come for dinner. They have a few outdoor seating too. I absolutely love this place!",0
"Food: $35.99 for AYCE meat option ($38~ for the option w seafood). Broth is mediocre. Vegetables were fresh. The fish balls that comes with the 24.99 option were frozen. The fish balls were still good, the fish roe is my fav! The meat quality was decent, but thats about it. I think you can find a better place for this price in the city.Service: 4/10 the server was not attentive. We picked the AYCE option and was told they could only bring our 2 plates per table. Ok, fine, but it took 30mins to bring our the meat twice... Our waiter also only checked on us 1x during the 90mins we were there. It was annoying to keep having to check in on the meat. The place wasn't that busy when we came (Sunday at 7pm)Ambience: 4/10 eh nothing special",0
"I had a great time at Covid! The outdoor seating was really cute and the spring feeling was really nice. The space can get a little loud, but it's worth it because the food is so good. The prices are a bit high, but it's worth it because the food is so good. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because it can get really packed!",1
"Lisa's Dumplings is a great place to go for dumplings, but I don't think they're worth the price. The pork dumplings are the best in my opinion, but they're also the most expensive. I think it would be worth it to try them out if you're a fan of dumplings, but I wouldn't recommend them over other Chinese food options in the area.",1
"Came here for lunch at work one day. The line was pretty long and I can't really say it went fast but the food was delicious. I decided to order three tacos; steak, chicken, and crispy fish. I never really order fish tacos but everyone talked about how great this one was in the reviews so I decided to try it- honestly it was amazing, definitely my favorite taco! They also had these amazing taco to go carriers. Highly recommend.",0
This place is great! The service is always friendly and happy. They always go out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. The food is also always top notch. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.,1
"I was unfortunately not impressed with this restaurant. The service was not great, and the food was simply OK. The margaritas on the rocks were quite strong, however, so that's something to be thankful for. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I haven't been here in a few years, but was really glad I stoped in today.  This spot has always been tiny, but you can see. Ganges due to covid restrictions have taken place.  So be warned, seating is super limited and they are requiring proof of vaccinating to dine in.  Mint lemonade was awesome!Tortilla were a little over done today... but honestly the quality of their tacos is so good that your tastes buds over look that.",0
"I came to this cozy restaurant on a Saturday night. It was just what I was looking for - pasta, wine, and warmth (from the outdoor heaters). For covid precautions- staff were wearing masks and there were dividers between tables. It was actually raining when we went but their seating area is under a roof. We didn't order appetizers because we snacked a little before going. They brought out complimentary focaccia along with a crostini with some sort of spread. I let my friends eat the crostini so I'm not sure if it was vegetarian. The focaccia was fresh and delicious! When it came to ordering my entree, I asked the waitress what vegetarian options they have and she gave me options of some of the meat pasta dishes that could be made vegetarian. I ended up getting the capricci with pesto without the pork. The pesto was so good- it was a kale pesto! Every bite had the perfect amount of sauce.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at this restaurant. The pasta was just the right amount of chewy, and the sauce and toppings were plentiful. The price is also quite reasonable for the level of quality you receive. My only complaint is that the service was a bit slow, but overall it was a great experience.",1
"Great overall place to visit.  Harding's is a spirited pub that serves some very decent food.  The inside design creates has a great classic bar feel and there is outside dining.  I was impressed with the quality of the food and ordered the beef short rib.  It was tender as you would expect and service was efficient.  Servers paired the short rib well with a class of cabernet.  Rather than my preferred one large ice cube the old fashion had smaller cubes of ice, but still balanced old fashion flavor.",0
"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. The celery in the veggie/tofu pad Thai was really strange and didn't taste good. The shrimp summer roll also came with some sweet sauce that was NOT a peanut sauce, which was really annoying. Overall, I would not recommend this place.",1
"The restaurant was decent but I was a bit disappointed. The food was good but it lacked a bit of flavor. The brisket was my favorite dish but it was a bit too oily for my taste. The duck wasn't bad but it didn't have much flavor either. Overall, I would recommend this place but I would just go elsewhere for a more memorable meal.",1
"I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon since I work nearby.  It's located in the back of the first floor on the right in the food court (behind the stairs).  I ordered the beef pho for takeout.  They packaged it very well and the broth was still hot when I got back to work.  All the items were separate: condiments (cilantro, bean sprouts, sriracha, hoisin, lime slices), rice noodles, and pho broth with beef.  The noodles were cooked well (not overcooked or undercooked).  There wasn't that much beef, wish there was more.  The flavor of the broth was very good and not too oily.  The staff were very friendly and fast.  I would come back to try their other noodles.",0
"Kyma is a great place to go for Greek food. The interior is nicely done, and the lighting is perfect. The flowers near the bathroom are a nice touch. The food was really good, and the service was great. I'll definitely be back.",1
"Omg. SO good! Normally I'm a superrr thin crust kind of girl, but my stomach and eyes also agreed with this one. Meat Lover's Pie $14: 10/10 would order this again - I could've eaten the whole pie myself in one sitting for sure. It's not that big, but filling enough (I ended up eating 3 out of 6 slices) due to the meat-dough-cheese-sauce ratio. And that ratio is perfect. Every bite was a delicious blend of cheese, meat, and carbs. It's not too sauce heavy, which is perfect for my tastes. Besides the toppings (pepperoni, sausage, and ham), the other best is actually the dough. It's crispy, fluffy, sturdy enough for all the heavy toppings, and just tastes delicious. Such a good mouth chew/bite. Ordered the buffalo wings ($10) as well, but didn't try. The smell was soooo strong though, my nose almost couldn't handle it. Friend who ate this was coughing consistently so it's definitely wings that has a kick!",0
"I stopped by Raku Soho for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. The food menu is much more expansive than their original East Village location, and I was especially impressed with the Niku Udon. It was juicy and tender, and I could definitely taste the spinach in it. Highly recommended!",1
"This place is great for a quick cheap breakfast! They have a pretty extensive menu with a lot of tasty options. I got a three egg omelet that came with potatoes and toast and it was only $7. I was so stuffed! They also have a lot of bakery items and more lunch items like sandwiches, rices, etc. I would definitely recommend a visit here!",1
"I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The food was good and reasonably priced. The ambiance is very casual fast food style, so if you're looking for a more high-end Korean BBQ experience, this isn't the place for you. However, the staff was friendly and the food came quickly, so I would recommend it.

One thing to note is that the seafood pancake lacked flavor, was mushy, and didn't have a sauce, so I would recommend skipping that dish. Overall, I had a good time at this restaurant and would recommend it.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant. The music was perfect and the staff was very welcoming. The HH special was a great deal and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend stopping by for a meal or drinks.,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The service was great and the food was even better. The prices are really reasonable, and it's a great place to grab a meal. I especially liked the Hot N Sour soup and the Ribs. The Fried Rice was also a great choice. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Jacob's is a great restaurant. It's just a little heavy and greasy compared to my normal tastes, but the flavors are very good. I got the hot chicken biscuit with fries, deviled eggs, and classic Mac n cheese. First of all, I thought the hot chicken biscuit would be as a sandwich, but it's actually a bowl with biscuit, hot chicken, and pickles. Again, a little greasy, but the flavors were very good. They compare this to Nashville hot chicken, and I'm from around Nashville--it's spicy and it's good, though not really ""hot."" I'm normally not a pickle person, but their pickles compliment the dish nicely. The fries were average and oily. The Mac n cheese, though I ordered a small, was a HUGE portion size. Again, a little heavy, but if you want cheese, they DO NOT cheat you on the cheese. It's very ooey and gooey, and best enjoyed while fresh and hot. Don't let it get cold or it will turn into a cheese brick. I had to get this during delivery for COVID 19, so I imagine it would be even better in house. Also, the deviled eggs were ok",1
"I was unfortunately very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The service was incredibly slow and unprofessional, and it was clear that the staff did not know what they were doing. Additionally, the woman next to me had a difficult time getting her food order correct, and it was quite embarrassing. The food itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about either. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I finally decided to try out Poke Bowls and I'm so glad I did! They have plenty of options to choose from in terms of the protein, toppings, and dressings. I got a shrimp tempura bowl with red onion, sweet corn, carrots, cilantro, pickled daikon, and wonton crisps smothered in sriracha aioli and wow. So so delicious and a pretty good portion for $13. Aside from the bowls, you can also get poke salads and sushi burritos - saw quite a few people ordering the latter so I'll be trying that soon too. 

The restaurant itself is a bit small but they do have a few tables and counters to eat in. There's water free of charge in the seating area. They also have a rewards card - after you buy a certain number of items you get a free one. Staff was nice considering how busy they were. Great spot overall, highly recommend checking it out if you're in the area.",1
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The food was really authentic and it was a lot of food for just two people. The only downside was that it was difficult ordering for just two people, as the menu is geared towards larger groups. The dish I ordered was really good and I would definitely recommend it.",1
Service was superb. Food was meh. Ive definitely had ethiopian food around the country as well as in Ethiopia and this place doesnt do it that well. The food lacked flavor and spice. We had the Doro Wat and Lamb Tibs along with a veggie plate.,0
"I had a delicious meal at this restaurant. The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food was well worth it. The flavor was great and the portion size was generous. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Above average old school pizza. Had a hard time ordering over the phone, but event got everything straightened out. The delivery was 5 minutes early, which was awesome.  The plaza was still hot when we got it.  Good job!",0
"Two Wheels is a great place to get pho. The broth is flavorful and the noodles are cooked perfectly. The only downside is that the servings are a bit small, so you might want to order a side dish to go with it. Overall, a great spot for a quick and easy meal.",1
"Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was slow. I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Pretty much my Go-To Harlem (or any place else) fried fish spot. Have traveled from the ends of the island and all points in between JUST for this fresh, fried bite of seafood heaven. ALWAYS fresh! I can count on them and measure other spots accordingly. Not too many others make the cut so we keep coming back.The lines are long FOR a REASON! Don't be discouraged. Also, have had a number of parking tickets cause it is sparse. Part of being a NYer. Been going OVER 20 years and it has remained constant! No frills just goodness. Staples are Whiting & Shrimp with Fries. Side of Tarter, Ketchup & hot sauce. Always get the bread, it is basic but soft and needed for a Fried Whiting sandwich.",0
"The coffee here was really good, but the staff was really grumpy and unhappy. I was concerned my coffee might put me in a bad mood, but fortunately it was a very happy cup of coffee. The menu is very limited, and they need to add hazelnut to the list. Overall, it was a decent experience, but they could use some improvement.",1
"The Extremely cramped outpost selling quick breakfast/lunch options. No line to speak of on a Friday morning (just after the work breakfast crowd), so had to go over the large menu quickly.Decided to go with the special - an Egg & Cheese Piadine with a 10oz drip coffee ($10 + $2 for additional bacon). Drink comes out first, a strong drip using Illy coffee. As for the Piadine, the outside reminds me of a traditional buttered roti, which is proceeded to be stuffed with eggs, bacon, and cheese. Eggs could have used more salt as I had to add some hot sauce to bring some more flavor. Greasy to hold but densely packed; a very filling start to the day. Place seems to be a hot spot for travelers, as I saw they have a luggage-holding service as well. Wish they were open on Saturday as well, though a nice stop for weekday breakfast/lunch.

Overall, the food was good but the place could use some more attention to detail. The service was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place for breakfast or lunch, but not for dinner.",1
Walking in the neighborhood we stumbled upon this place. We ordered soup dumplings which were Delicious. For our entree we ordered stir fried rice and the Kung Pao Chicken with Roasted Chili and Peanuts. The food was great and big portions.,0
"Delicious, fresh steamed rice roll. This dish is quite popular at the dimsum restaurant. Over here they make it fresh when customers order.I love the texture of the rice roll (cheong fun). The sauce is just nice, not too salty.I also got the jianbing, they added spme sort of cracker so it's crunchy in the middle. I love this spot so much. East, no fuss, delicious food.",0
"Ordered delivery through seamless/grub hub. My order was over an hour late. Poor communication. The pho was so underwhelming. The broth was quite bland, sure you get some beefy aroma but that was it. I missed the star anise and cinnamon and sweetness from the onions that you would normally get in a good rich pho broth. It didn't that bad but it wasn't good either. Definitely not worth the price. Will not be ordering from here again.",0
"I absolutely loved the aesthetics of this restaurant - it's so cute in the front with the flower shop, and then right behind the restaurant is a little shop with more flowers! Every dish incorporates a floral ingredient, which was really refreshing. We got the lavender latte, buckwheat waffle and flat iron steak, and the lavender latte was so refreshing and the steak was sublime. The buckwheat waffle was too dry for me, but the flat iron steak was amazing. The restaurant wasn't packed at midday, and I heard their dinner menu is quite different. One thing that absolutely drove me nuts was their AC. It actually feels like a strong wind indoors. We asked if they could turn it down, but by the end of the meal I was sick of having the air blowing against me and my hair flying all over. I chose to eat indoors for a reason. I would definitely return, but sit in a different spot to avoid the AC.",1
"Stopped in for a quick snack.The pepperoni slice was your standard NY slice. The garlic knots were okay, but were probably sitting out too long and the quick trip in the oven couldn't save them. I drowned them in the marinara sauce and they were ok.I will try these guys again during the day to nab something fresher.",0
Alta is a great restaurant with consistently great food and service. Sitting outside in the little alcove right next to the entrance was magical on a late summer night. Highly recommend!,1
"I wanted to love this place as much as everyone else, but I left unimpressed and feel bad that I can't rave about it. The one thing I will truly rave for is my waiter. He was very patient, so friendly, and very helpful with helping indecisive us pick what to eat.

We got the disco fries because everyone raves about it in reviews. The curry is good, but the fries taste like the really starchy kind you'd buy frozen from the grocery store. The coconut and other toppings helped, but it wasn't incredible. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't recommend.

The crab fried rice: this was shockingly bland. There's a good amount of crab which was yummy, but the rice tasted like plain rice. I've had better from places half the price.

The pad Thai with shrimp: my friend was feeling nostalgic so we went with tradition pad Thai. It was cooked nicely, but lacked any kick in flavor. Overall, not sure if it was just an off evening, but I expected more flavor explosions in my mouth. Instead, I left questioning if my taste buds all died while waiting for a table since nothing tasted worth trying.",1
"This place is really great! The food is delicious and fast, and the staff is really friendly. I highly recommend coming here if you're looking for a quick, affordable lunch. Just be careful not to wait in line, as it can get pretty busy!",1
"{Overall: 5; Food: 4.5} Atmosphere: 5; Service: 5One of my favorite ramens in NYC. Tonkotsu ramen here really hits the spot. The broth is flavorful and rich without being too creamy. The noodles and pork are cooked perfectly.The Tonchin Chicken Tsukune buns are a great appetizer to start with. They also make awesome cocktails.Added bonus that there's almost never a wait when I want to eat here. They have a unique, upbeat vibe and play club-like music. Sometimes they even have a live DJ. Good outdoor setup for COVID.",0
"Jones Wood is one of my favorite bars on the Upper East Side, and their food has always been top-notch. I was intrigued by their new outdoor garden area and decided to check it out last night for dinner with a friend. We both had the JWF Burger and Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and both dishes were amazing. I was blown away by how delicious everything was, and I can't believe I waited so long to visit Jones Wood. I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great meal in a quiet setting.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The AC was a life-saver on a hot day, and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the Yunshang Rice Noodles, which were both healthy and flavorful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious Chinese food.",1
"We love the breakfast here. It's a nice, familiar place for us so we make it a point to start our day here one in a while.  A lot of traditional French fare but it is consistently good - high quality ingredients, delicious, excellent service, prepared and presented well.  Plus we love the warm, inviting, bistro style dining room.  Many good choices on the menu but I just wanted a simple breakfast this time so I ordered the poached eggs and avocado on toast accompanied with a really good, fresh salsa.  Simple dish but the salsa made it that much better.  Also ordered the ""bowl"" of cappuccino, and it was certainly a bowl.  Looked and tasted great, ordering it in that size of a vessel is more of a fun thing.  We also ordered the white egg omelette which was generous in portion and also delicious.  It came with breakfast potatoes which were tasty as well, really tasty.  One of these days we'll make it in for lunch or dinner and I'm sure it will be just as good, but for us this is our go-to breakfast place when in town.",0
"We had a great time at Tailor Public House! The decor is very nice, and the location is perfect - close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Our server Roselia was very friendly and efficient, and our food was delicious. We ordered a Cobb salad and the fried chicken sandwich - both of which were very good. Any lunch at less than $20 per person in Manhattan is a great value, and in this case, with great food and great service, Tailor Public House is definitely worth a visit.",1
"Second time dining at The Shadmoor, this time for lunch. They have great happy hour deals for food and drinks starting at noon on the weekdays. The lunch menu is similar to dinner with a couple different options. We started with the Tuna on Crack (which I have ordered before). The tuna was fresh and seasoned well. Definitely a must order item. For my main, I ordered the Fish and Chips, which was absolutely delicious. The fish was flaky with crisp breading and the fries were very tasty. I highly recommend trying this dish. The Shadmoor is a great restaurant for lunch and dinner. Brunch is next on my list to try! Check out this restaurant if your in the neighborhood!",0
"I came here for a business lunch in the middle of the week and had a fine experience, the food was hit and miss, but the service was very attentive.The olives that were given to us with the bread was a nice start to the meal.  My dining partner and I opted to get the lunch tasting menu and to add the 3 crudo tasting to it.  I think this was a nice way to be able to sample the items on the menu.The crudo tasting while good was drenched in too much olive oil for my liking that it overpowered the flavor of the fish.I ordered the fish liver appetizer to start and it was quite tasty though I think I prefer foie gras type rather than fish liver.  My dining companions salad looked very fresh. For my main I ordered a grilled fish, I believe it was branzino, which they fileted for us.  I found the fish to be a little lacking in flavor and unevenly cooked, some parts were definitely a little raw.The coffee with gingerbread dessert was good if you like espresso, which they pour into a cup over the gelato for you.Overall, I think this is a fine option for a business lunch in the area, but I probably won't be back.",0
"I had a great time at Olio e Piu! The food was delicious, and the outdoor seating was really nice. The mushroom risotto was my favorite, and everything else I tried was also great. The only downside was that the portions were a bit small, but that didn't stop me from enjoying everything. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"I had a delicious experience at this restaurant! The Berkshire katsu was especially succulent and soft, with a light batter. I'll definitely be back to try other katsu items!",1
"I had the best steamed rice roll I've ever had in New York City at Yi Ji Shi Mo. The rice roll is amazing, and the minced roasted pork is so good that it gets stuck in your teeth. The curry fish balls and eggs are also highly recommended, and they taste better than they sound. The restaurant is small and unassuming, and my orders come out quickly and piping hot. I'm not sure if it is famous online, but I can see how this place may be overlooked, so I recommend you take advantage and broaden your horizons.",1
"I've only ordered delivery. I would like to try dining in one day, since this place is so close to me. The delivery is awesome. We often order the rigatoni bolognese, the penne a la vodka and this amazing pizza, the ultimate supreme pizza. And when we feel like carb loading even more we get the garlic bread. The food is delicious and also comes with a few pieces of soft bread (focaccia possibly). We have tried other dishes, but these are our favorites. Probably order here 2-3x a month and it is consistently delicious.",0
"Totally returning! After giving up on waiting at Uncle Boons, I decide to give this Thai a try....and I'm so glad I did.   Note, unlike Thai Diner/Uncle Boons, Noree is more traditional.  There were only 2 or 3 tables indoors fwith people ...which was great given CoVid. If you're looking for more hybrid of Thai and American and natty wine, Uncle Boons is recommended. But TD's Thai salad doesn't do it for me. Reviews for 2 items and outdoor set upFood 5:I ordered fried whole red snappers ($24-25) and Green papaya salad ($8). They were both top-notch. They don't skimp on green papaya by adding a bunch of lettuce and carrots. Fried red snapper... generous portion and perfectly fried, placed on banana leaf. Nice sauce, but would've been even better had the chef added much more garlic and less sugar given i ordered  garlic basil sauce. Maybe namprik and a lime wedge on the side would've been a nice touch. Comes with a side of rice. Loved the crispy Thai basil or lime leaves.  Great cocktail list. Lackluster wine list Service+Outdoor setup 5:Are outside.  The hut on sidewalk is complete w individual doors per table. The thick plastic partition/sliding doors can be opened if your group is 8+ people. Staffs are professional, super friendly and efficient.",0
Got it from doordash delivery. The sauce on the chips is pretty good and goes well with both the fish and the chips. The fish is not super fresh (but it's okay for a fried fillet) and taste normal. The price is on the high side at $18 before tax.,0
Had a very pleasant dinner here. The staff was very accommodating - there's an indoor and outdoor option and we opted for indoor. The sushi is very fresh! Was not disappointed.,0
"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food was generally good, and the service was a bit of a mess, but I can understand why it might be busy. I would recommend ordering many small dishes, getting a pitcher of sangria or bottle of wine, and chatting with friends here. Keep in mind that the food can be a bit salty, but overall it's a decent place to eat.",1
"After checking out places to eat in the area we decided to come here & give it a try, adding your name to the Yelp wait list is a good idea a lot of traffic in & out of this place. Appetizers to start the Steamed dumplings, these were ground pork & shrimp with soy sauce for dipping good dumplings, nice taste a bit on the heavy side not your typical steamed dumpling. we also had the Curry Puffs which are mined chicken wow these were delicious really great taste to them, even better with the sweet cucumber sauce. Main dishes I had the Krapraw Gai Sub this is minced chicken with onions, peppers & basil leaves, topped with fried egg on top of rice very tasty dish, good flavor to the chicken. My company had the Pad Se-ew , great tasting noodles good taste with the added chicken. Small location, nicely decorated & decent prices.. I was a bit torn on the stars because the food was good but what we had was decent but not over the top I settled on the 3 stars because we were not too pleased with the service being that it is a small location you really feel the rushed they serve quickly & try to get u off that chair just as quickly now I get u need that quick turn around but I am not a fan of being rushed through my meal takes away from enjoying the food properly.",0
"Haymaker provides a truly plant-based meal experience in Chelsea. The Crispy Yuca is excellent, with a great smoked paprika aioli, while the Curried Cauliflower is lovely. The Rainbow Roasted Carrots with pea shoots, green garlic, ricotta and dill are also delicious. The Mac & Cheese is one of the better ones I've had in the city. All in all, a great choice for those looking for a vegan meal in Chelsea.",1
Expensive lunch for 1 (and a toddler) but it's the city and it was delicious. Stopped in before going to comic con and am very happy I did. Had chicken fried rice and truly it was some of the best fried rice I've ever had. And I lived in China for several years. It was flavorful and the chicken was amazing!! I was surprised by how good it was. Completely recommend!! Really nice portion of fries for $4. This little place makes me wish I lived in the city or at least went into the city more. I would definitely go back!!,0
"I had a great time visiting Omar's Kitchen and Rum Bar! The small plates were delicious, and I really appreciate that they provide warm water with no ice for the table. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have all the food prepared when the doors opened, and the table water wasn't cold enough. Overall, I had a great time and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",1
"Public Village is the best new Chinese restaurant that my husband and I have discovered during the last year. Granted, we haven't ventured to many new Chinese restaurants in NYC with COVID, but Public Village, which specializes in Sichuan cuisine, was mind-blowing. They make their chili oil and other spices from scratch; their noodles are handmade as well. Public Village is more expensive than the greasy spoons (no judgment there; I'm a huge fan of the cheap eats) in Chinatown, but you get what you pay for. We ordered the dry wan za spinach and egg noodles with pork ($15)  and the drunken braised beef squid ink noodles ($15), both of which were fantastic. The handmade noodles were the perfect chewiness. Both had bold, fresh flavors, with indeed the requisite Sichuanese spiciness! The redolent, vibrant flavors and attentiveness to textures and fresh ingredients truly make Public Village's dishes stand out. I will definitely be returning to Public Village. They have interesting desserts, including bing fen, homemade elderflower tamarind, and plum juice. Plum juice in particular brings up all kinds of nostalgia of my childhood summers, when my mother used to make it as a refreshing but slightly salutary drink. It's not something commonly seen on menus, and I'm keen on trying Public Village's version.",0
"Pocha 32 is one of my favorite restaurants in Ktown, especially when it's after 1 am and you're craving Asian drunk foods. I always want to have both savory and sweet dishes at one table, and I have a few go-to's for each:Savory - soups. The fish cake stew is one of my favorites, but you can't go wrong with any of the soups available. Each of the fish cakes come in skewers, which makes it much easier to pick up (trust me, it's useful). All of the broths have so much umami that I know I can't replicate them in home cooking. The Korean seafood pancake is a great carb-heavy dish to help soak up alcohol. There's also plenty of grilled, stir-fried, noodle, and rice optionsSweet - the deep-fried menu has a lot of sweet sauces. The fried chicken in sweet garlic sauce with French fries is the best! Such a good combination of east meets west. It's not fried with too much breading, and it's much crispier than I expected. Watermelon soju is also an amazing cold drink.It's a very small but cozy restaurant that's bustling with people. The tables can be a bit small and the seating is cramped, but those are what makes Pocha 32 such a fun place to go and catch up with friends after a long week.",0
"I really enjoy this Italian restaurant. The food always tastes great when I eat it in person, but it can also be enjoyed through their delivery service. The pasta dishes are my favorite, but I also really enjoy their baked clams and pizza. The only downside is that their mozzarella sticks are not my favorite, but they're still decent. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
The afternoon tea here wasn't very good - the bites were quite small and the tea wasn't fresh. I don't think I'd recommend this place.,1
"I stopped by Lunch this past week and was pleasantly surprised by the busy atmosphere. The combo meal I sampled came with soup and salad, as well as three meats and a side of rice. My favorite dish was the hanger steak, which had great texture and a sweet seasoning. The other two thinly sliced meats were also good. The kalbi was a bit bland, but was still enjoyable to try the sauces with. Overall, a great experience! The staff was friendly and the prices were very reasonable for happy hour. I would definitely recommend Lunch to others.",1
Peng's Noodle Folk is a great place to go for a delicious bowl of ramen. The staff is super sweet and the portions are HUGE! The chicken katsu ramen I had was amazing and the broth was very flavorful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious bowl of ramen.,1
"We were in the area on a recent Sunday evening and were able to drop in with no wait. Hearty and warm Japanese greeting by the mostly American millenial staff. Kinda goofy but it was cool. I had the spicy tonkotsu aka karaka-men which was creamy and rich in flavor but much too salty. In addition to the pork bone I could taste seaweed or fish. In fact I thought I ordered the wrong ramen at first. Anyhow it was delicious despite the saltiness. The ramen noodles were a tad soft. I don't know if it's related but I saw the staff stockpiling a lot of pre-made ramen noodles in the kitchen. The piece of pork was ok. They were all relatively small pieces but there were more than one. I think Menya sandaime in Fort Lee had better pork chashu since it's a bigger good quality piece and they put a flame to it before putting it in the bowl. Akamaru was another variation of tonkotsu which was delicious. Mushrooms and garlicy flavor. Seafood pancake was a bit disappointing. Though cooked well I honestly didn't taste any seafood at all. No bits of octopus or pork. Just batter, cabbage and bonito flakes. For $15 I expect more. Overall though, the prices are not bad considering its Manhattan. I had ramen in the burbs of NJ recently that cost $12-15.",0
"We've really enjoyed late night NY pizza and we've gotten pizza from Champion a few times now. Very good, piping hot, fresh and tasty.",0
"Had my birthday dinner here with just my husband and myself. As a Halloween lover, this place was too perfect. I loved the dramatics and the actors. Loved how dark and spooky fun it was. Wasn't expecting food to be good, but we devoured the fries and really enjoyed our steaks. Definitely recommend for those of us who love Halloween!",0
"Overall, I was very confused by this restaurant and the atmosphere they were going for. I have passed it all the time in the UES and finally came for dinner with my boyfriend and cousin. I called to make a reservation but they only take reservations for 6pm and 7:30pm but ""may have other openings earlier"". We showed up about 45 minutes early for our 7:30pm reservation and got seated no problem. Not sure why they couldn't just reserve a table for 6:45pm like I asked?

The menu is a mix of Italian/American/Mexican/Seafood. All of the food our party ordered was nothing spectacular and seemed overpriced for what we ordered. A small bowl of tater tots for $13?

Service was almost TOO attentive and we felt like we were being watched by our waiter the entire time since there weren't many other tables. I realize this was them wanting to clear things when finished/asking if we wanted more.

Decor was a bit all over the place - It looked like they were going for a ""JG Melon"" old school vibe but couldn't pull it off and felt a bit tacky.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend for",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good. The only downside was that our waitress was a bit forgetful, which made it difficult to get our order correct. But overall, I would definitely come back here.",1
"The Mary Lane is a great new restaurant on the corner of Bank and Greenwich Streets. The great West Village ambiance is only surpassed by their interesting and creative food. The cocktails, wine list and service are all impeccable. The Mary Lane is perfect for Saturday night or date night or just your random Tuesday night dinner.",1
"We went to Banter for brunch on a post-Christmas weekend. The restaurant does not take reservations, and with it being the day after Christmas, there was a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes). As with most NYC restaurants in the post-Covid era, there is both indoor and outdoor seating. While it was a cold day, our outdoor seating was very warm and cozy. The staff at the restaurant was very efficient and took our orders soon after we were seated. I was looking forward to trying the Nutella stuffed French Toast. Unfortunately, by the time we were seated, that dish was sold out (word to the wise - try to get to this restaurant before 1 PM if you want this popular item). However, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was an excellent substitute, and spicy mayo in the sandwich was well complemented by the sweet potato fries. We also ordered the banana bread to share between 3 of us. The restaurant has a good selection of coffees, drinks, and brunch cocktails (sorry, no mocktails), and I liked both my latte and my wife's chai latte. The barista does a fantastic job to make the coffee drinks aesthetically pleasing (I hope my picture of the latte does it some justice).I (enviously) watched other tables' order of the Nutella stuffed French Toast, and I would definitely welcome the opportunity to go back to Banter if I am again in the area.",0
The Tavern is a great restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was tasty. The only downside was that the wine pours were a bit small.,1
"So glad to see our favorite dim sum place open for outdoor dining. There are only a few tables so get here early!!! The food is every bit as good though I am missing the ability to get chili sauce at my whim. All the dishes are served in single serve containers except the steamed stuff and you are safely cordoned off by plexi glass barriers. I must've missed the ownership change but they take cards other than discover and Amex now. Mm can't wait to come back. Our go tos are crab xlb, spicy Szechuan wontons, shrimp dumplings, bamboo shoots and pan fried pork buns. I wish they would serve or let us bring beers :)",0
"I rate it only a 3 because of the mouth of our waiter and the poor quality and taste of the AYCE $29 3 spaghetti dish, that was so heavily pushed on us. So glad I ordered the baked chicken. The calamari to share was also the best i ever had. Tasty and cooked perfect. So the special at this Reaturant is the $29 AYCE 3 types of spaghetti dish. 1) The first one was Paccheri pasta with broccoli, watery and tasteless. 2) Ox Tail Ravioli. Was also bland and wasn't anything special. 3) 3rd and last was a Very Spicy Tomato sauce spaghetti. There you go. No one on my table who ordered it got seconds. Now to the chicken I ordered it was delicious and cooked perfect, Polo al Limone a boneless chicken breast with buttery mushroom risotto. All dishes come with a nice Caesars salad. We were there at 5 pm asked when our Broadway show was, we said 8pm. Then we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. Once it arrived. 2 out of the 4 main meals arrived 10 mins after everyone else's. And those were the 2 that ordered the Trio of Pasta. I'll be more knowledgeable the next time we go there if we do.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant had a great atmosphere and service. However, the prices were a bit high for what you got. I would recommend checking it out if you're looking for a casual night out, but don't expect to get your money's worth.",1
"I came here for dinner and sadly was far from impressed. We started with the traditional guacamole - it was almost impossible to eat as it tasted like we are eating garlic sticks! It also didn't come with chips but came with it tostadas instead.... Not sure why.

We then shared thee peplin and mahi tacos - again, very average at best. I won't be coming here again.",1
"I have ordered take out a lot of times from here and it never disappoints. We decided to try today by actually going to the restaurant. The ambience is great, they have a big great outside area. The menu is a bit different than any other Peruvian food, they called steak stir fry to the famous Peruvian dish ""Lomo Saltado""Food: we tried ceviche, lomo saltado, huancaina risotto with steak. Service: it is slow, the food and the drinks came very fast but unfortunately our waitress was very slow to get to my table and to check on the table. Ambience: there is brunch so the environment can be a bit party while you are having lunch. They had a person playing very nice music outside.",0
"I was extremely disappointed in this place. First the burgers at McDonalds are better than this. After waiting patiently for ever to support a local business; only to be let down like this. I guess you pay for the name and the hype surrounding the owner. But wasn't my favorite place. Also, they only give women free veggie burgers and charge men for the same free burger. Sexism on a menu. Where's the equality on that? This should be free for all, guess it's a marketing ploy to get more women to come eat a veggie burger and spread the word. They even have a $100 burger. ‍",0
"Overall, I had a great experience at Cascabel Taqueria. The food was delicious and the service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Excellent Experience!We took advantage of Restaurant week and we visited this beautiful Restaurant. We were checking for a nice restaurant to go to lunch, this one was one of the top in the Restaurant week list for Steak. We made reservations through the restaurant week website.  Everything was great Hostess friendly , great website, Fast servers and Excellent presentation.  The food was limited to the Restaurant week Menu but was on formidable!  A little sad they don't have a drinks Menu , I love to try new drinks LOL.   Food   Sirloin Steak - 5 of 5 - Great portion and was very well cook   Salmon 5 of 5 - Excellent taste  ! Kudos to the chef Drinks  Martinis - 5 of 5 ExcellentOne thing , if you want to come to enjoy these restaurants during restaurant Week you need to have in Mind that The Menu is fixed to a couple of plates that maybe are their popular or not. Just check the Menu before you go to a restaurant so you don't get frustrated because you don't like what you see. Everything was excellent",0
Small group for dinner.  We were seated at a booth and it was tight...  Terrific service though made the evening very enjoyable.  The selections variedceith dome shared appetizers which morevfried based and not my ideal but tasty.  Salad was kale and it was excellent. Dinner was the salmon and I loved it. IAM oatmeyidl fonit worked out well. Overall the place was diner like. Nice comfortable and good quality food.  I would go back. I recommend this place.,0
Covacha is a tourist trap. The food is mediocre at best and the atmosphere is cramped and uncomfortable. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.,1
"I absolutely love the Dumpling House! The dumplings are some of the best I've ever had, not made at home. They have a few varieties that are great steamed, fried or in soup. The spicy beef and chicken basil ones are my favorites. They also have sesame sandwiches and noodle bowls with dumplings, but I've not had those yet. I usually have to get 2 orders to be full and when I come to the city, I get frozen ones to pack and cook at home. The price is great and the dumplings are delicious. I highly recommend the Dumpling House if you're in the area!",1
"Not impressed by the food. The wait staff was great. The stars are for them. Came with a friend, after we scrolled thru a long list of places in the UES we decided to come here. She hasnt been to the UES since she moved to the City. I am embarrassed.The garden seating was not available when we got there but we did request for garden seats when we made the reservation. So sidewalk seats for us - btw they were just wooden boxes... Also the tables are round but the paper that covers the tables were squares. You can imagine us dropping silverwares all night. Had three drinks, Belgium fries, Brussel sprouts, and beet salad. My friend was on a diet so she didn't feel like eating. The Belgium fries... Meh. I love Belgium fries but I can make better one's myself. The Brussels sprouts had sugar sprinkled on top. It tasted weird. The beet salad with spinach is hard to mess up, you would think. Honestly, don't even waste your money or calories. It was not restaurant quality. Not even a typical chain salad bar quality. We ended up with $60 plus per person for the overall really meh food. Sigh",0
"Delicious. Ordered the traditional Kurume style ramen and the spicy ramen. The tonkotsu broth was incredibly rich and creamy... I couldn't have enough of it. According to their website, it is because of their unique method of making the broth via the ""yobimodoshi"" method. The noodles themselves were of the thin variety and served as the perfect vehicle for that wonderful broth. And the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg made everything even better.The skewers were solid but did not stand out from many of the other yakitori restaurants in NYC.Decor was modern and clean. Overall great and attentive service.Definitely curious to try their spicy tomato ramen next time!",0
"We stopped by this restaurant on a whim and we're so glad we did! The soup dumplings were delicious, and the stir fried rice was even better. The Kung Pao chicken was amazing - the sauce was spicy and flavorful, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The portions were really generous, too, which was great. We'll definitely be back!",1
"The brunch at this restaurant was delicious! The breakfast basket I ordered was especially good, and I would definitely recommend it. The only downside is that the cost of brunch was a bit more than I was expecting, but the food was worth it. The restaurant is also very lively and full of students from NYU, so it's definitely worth a visit.",1
"The restaurant is really nice, with large chandeliers and a unique bamboo-looking covering on the whole ceiling. We had a reservation and the place wasn't super busy, but when the hostess first attempted to seat us, it was right in the back in an already crowded area, pretty much a foot away from the tables on either side. We asked to be moved, and she put us at a round table with more room. We ordered a bottle of sake, and it was $110 for the bottle and when it was brought to the table, it was not properly chilled. The waitress took it and brought it back in a bucket of ice.

The menu has a variety of appetizers and small plates meant for sharing, entrees, sushi rolls and sushi/sashimi. We decided to share, and ordered the koi sticky rice with tuna appetizer. It was delicious! We ordered a 2nd one and it was way to sticky....it was hard to chew and was sticking to my teeth. We also ordered the tuna tartare appetizer, which was very buttery and seared perfectly. We had the lobster mini tacos, which were good. These apps all came with 4 pieces. The tartare was 6 pieces.",1
"It's understandable why this restaurant appears on most of the top or best lists including Zagat...and why it's a favorite of our friends. Thank you to D & J for introducing us to a great experience. This Soho restaurant is owned by the Marshalls -- a couple who've found a winning combination. He as chef in the kitchen;she as overseer of the wine. It's been around since 1996 and is now considered a classic. Our reservations were honored and we were seated immediately. Service throughout was very very attentive. The amuse bouche was tuna tartar served in small spoons. They give you 3 types of bread -- a corn stick with jalapeños, focaccia bread, and a slice of French baguette. After cocktails, we started with a shared order of tuna tartar. And I had an off the menu ""made just for me"" order of baked stuffed clams. 4 midsize clams to an order with garlic, Parmesan, and bread crumbs; the clams were chopped chunkily and served in the shell. So delish I licked the shells.For entrees, we had a couple orders of the mushroom truffle crusted cod which was served over creamed spinach. Plus a bouillabaisse with the largest prawn I've ever seen (plus shrimp, clams, mussels) in a saffron broth. And an order of baked scallops served with a crab risotto. Everything scrumptious! Desserts (we shared) were a black walnut pie and an apple tart topped with cinnamon ice cream. If you have a special occasion, this is the place to go and celebrate. Even if not, prices are inline with a good seafood restaurant. Anything you order will not disappoint.",0
"Bareburger is a restaurant chain that started in Astoria and still feels local. Yesterday I got lunch with two friends at the W 57th Street location. We were seated at a comfortable booth and scanned the QR code for the menu. We ordered an assortment of plant-based food. I thought the nuggets were delicious, an authentic-tasting vegan take. French fries to go with the burgers. And then the burgers themselves. The Forager, with its mushrooms and seeded bun, tasted so good! You're telling me something this yummy is also nutritious? Wow!Sounds like Bareburger has a good happy hour so I'll likely be back. The plant-based offerings are worthy substitutes for the ""real"" stuff.  Prices are good and the service was on point.",0
"I was intrigued by their fully plant based menu and it did not disappoint! We got their Crispy Rice, Bao Sliders, Bang Bang Broccoli, Dan Dan Noodles, Rainbow Roll, and Udon Noodles. Their crispy rice, and Bao Sliders were our favorites. The crispy rice was so flavorful and crunchy. It kind of tasted like a tater tot to me, haha I don't know why because it's rice and not potatoes. The bao slider was very flavorful and unique. I've never had fried oyster mushrooms like that, but it was really good. Definitely a little pricey though.. it's one bao per order. The bang bang broccoli was good, but it kind of just tasted like tempera broccoli. It could have used some more flavor and sauce. The Dan Dan Noodles were good. I've never had Dan Dan noodles before, but we thought it tasted more like a curry noodle bc of the coconut milk. The udon noodles were also good and al denté.We ordered the rainbow roll because we saw someone else order it and it looked so good and we also wanted to try more of the watermelon ""fish"". It was okay. Probably our least favorite. The slaw on top took away from the sushi. It was crazy though the sushi had seafood flavors as if there was fish! Curious about their other rolls!",0
This place has the cutest cocktail names that match how good the cocktails really are. I came for a few drinks with my friends and had such a great time. Also snack on the Brussel Sprouts. One of the best around. Would definitely come back again!,0
"We came here for brunch but ended up ordering a bunch of items that are also on the dinner menu. Everything was very good. We had the following:-STRACCIATELLA: Thomcord Grape, Walnuts, Rosemary: this was very good and I would recommend getting this. All of the flavors went so well together -SQUASH CAPONATA: Parmigiano Reggiano, Pine Nuts, Currants: this was good, but it was so oily. I don't think I would order this again.-TAGLIATELLE: Bolognese, Parmigiano Reggiano: this was very good, but the sauce wasn't traditional. It was a very light sauce which I liked but my husband prefers the more traditional bolognese sauce-AGNOLOTTI DEL PLIN: Koginut Squash, Black Truffle, Parmigiano Reggiano : this dish was very good and the sauce was amazing. I just wish the pasta was a little thinner. -we also got about 4 different cocktails, but they were all just ok. This is a great restaurant to go to if you're in the area but I enjoy trying restaurants all over the city so I'm not sure I'm going to rush coming back here.",0
"I've been coming to this restaurant for nearly 50 years and the service, value, and portions have never changed. The sangria is always delicious, and the menu has a great variety of dishes that can be shared. The only downside is that they don't take cards, so you have to cash only.",1
I've been here twice and tried the beef and scallion pancake sandwich and the pork Dan Dan mixian dish. The sandwich is amazing if a little sloppy to eat. The pork dan dan was very average. I'm not sure those types of noodles are good for a Dan Dan dish and there weren't enough pickles to balance out the fatty pork.  I heard the grandma mixian is supposed to be good and will try it next time.Also the staff are pretty friendly.,0
This place is fantastic! They have an extensive menu outside of just pizza which is great. They also have a great selection of appetizers and desserts. The pizza is really good too - definitely worth checking out!,1
"Given all the terrific reviews and ordering suggestions we were very anxious to eat here. We waited outside for about 15 minutes and were seated at a table by the door on cold night. The door opened about every 20 seconds either by the waiters bringing food out, delivery men or perspective patrons. It just got too cold sitting there. So we left before ordering. We will be back. It's BYOB which is great. We even brought some wine and beer. Remember it's a 'tiny' place AND, believe it or not, there's NO TOILET for patrons only for employees. I've never seen that in a restaurant before so I looked up the  policy for NYC: ""If a food service establishment has 20 or more seats and opened after 1977, it must provide a toilet for its customers. All other food service establishments are exempt from this requirement. Food establishments are not required to allow public access to their employee toilets."" Maybe there's only 19 seats. Still looking forward to giving it a try.",0
"Heard that this spot used to be a Michelin star place and closed down but the same crew of chefs stayed behind at the new place and the quality of their food certainly reflected that!! Got an assorted servings of dumplings for appetizers. I'm particularly a fan of the Pork Dumplings in Chili Oil. The casing was the right thickness for boiled dumpling and the filling was super flavoful and umami. The chili oil taste wasn't the strongest but that didn't detract from the experience. The Pork Soup Dumplings were decent too but there could have been more soup and the casing was a tad too thick. I also really liked the Mouth Watering Chicken which was a cold appetizer of chicken thigh in peanut sauce and chili oil. Similarly with the Dan Dan Noodles, very palatable. For mains, we shared a couple of entrees with some rice. The ones that stood out to me were the Tofu with Crab Meat and the Kung Pow Chicken. Silky tofu in salted egg yolk sauce and crab meat. The salted egg yolk wasn't super strong so I think that would appeal more to the larger crowd. The Kung Pow Chicken might have been the best that I've ever had. Full of flavors and spices. Plenty of peanuts.This is a really good spot for Chinese food. Great for groups especially if people are into family style eating.",0
"Meh. Nothing special. Wouldn't return. The burger was good but the bun was stale so it was whatever. The angel pie was good but they might as well call it the mushroom pie cause that's what 90% of the pizza is. The vodka pie was good but was warm not hot when it came out. The spicy chicken sandwich was very very spicy, they don't play around. This was my first time at this Emmy location. I use to absolutely love the Williamsburg one but ever since they opened all the other locations the quality just got worse and worse.",0
"I stopped by this cute neighborhoody Israeli spot and was pleasantly surprised. The menu is mostly solid with a few ok items and a few very good items. I thought the giant AC unit was a bit too effective for near tables and ineffective for other tables, but the place overallsuffers from some logistical shortcomings. The outdoor/sidewalk area isn't kept as clean as it should be, but the service is good when the place isn't busy. Overall, a decent spot for Israeli food in the area.",1
"Nonono is a Japanese yakitori restaurant that focuses on skewers (the Yaki) and in particular for chicken (the Tori). They also offer other general Japanese food such as sushi and ramen. Unfortunately, the prices just do not justify the mediocre quality of the food, neither for the yakitori nor for the general offerings.

The FoodTanTan RamenTanTan is a type of noodle mixed with ground meat and in a spicy type of sauce. Nonono adapts this into ramen by adding a creamy broth. Strangely, however, it's barely spicy, missing the point of the dish. I asked for additional hotsauce to fix the dish, and costed $2.

Beef SkewerThe beef skewer is priced only at $4.5 but the reason for this is that you get four incredibly thin pieces of beef. Perhaps I was simply unlucky?

SteakI knew going in that this was not going to be a real steak, and that the star of the dish was the sweet onion sauce, which was definitely delicious. I don't think that excuses providing very dry and well done beef though.",1
"The dumplings at this restaurant are a bit of a letdown. The skin is thick and the dumplings themselves are not juicy or tasty. However, the free snack is amazing! Fried dumpling skin is a great way to start your meal and I couldn't stop eating it.",1
"Came on a weeknight with a reservation. There was plenty of seating. We were one of the last ones out, yet they did not rush us! Very friendly service and beautiful decor inside.1. Octopus - Small tentacles but a good amount served. Flavorful. 2. Bronzini - You can taste the grilled taste which was good. 3. Sashito peppers - Good tasting and well cooked and grilled. 4. Baklava - Good to split, very sweet which was expected.Overall, a good place to get dinner and try once!",0
"I had high hopes for Beetle House, but unfortunately my experience was not great. Our party of six arrived on time and we were promptly seated, but the magician and actor from Alice wonderland were the only attractions. We ordered the Bio-exorcism drink which was yummy and strong, but the other half ordered the Mystery blood bag and the Beetle's juice. The pre-fixed menu meant that we all shared appetizers, and the Boogies braised bacon and Giant peach salad were both good. However, the Nightmare on 6th Street fries were amazing! The steak was not worth the upgrade, and the burger was also good but not great. The wait for our food was a little insane, and when the cold plate finally came out, it was re-made. The redhead lady was nice but not on top of water refills, or drinks in general. It wasn't that busy, and we all work in the food industry, so I don't know why the experience was not great. We won't be returning.",1
"This place is sooo nice! I love the entire theme and decor of it all, it's definitely a great date spot or a place to catch up with your friends! Remember to also bring your vaccination card and ID if you want to dine in here! I ordered the Maze Cosmopolitan pineapple flavor and I really liked the drink! It's really small for a cocktail drink, but this can hit you hard if you're lightweight like me. The drinks are super cute here and I wish I could have tried the food here as well. Service is great as well.",0
"The Capital Grille is one of my favorite restaurants. The staff is always so accommodating and attentive, and the food is always delicious. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, and the menu has something for everyone. I look forward to coming here every month!",1
"Sidney's Five has a great vibe thats good for hanging out with friends on a saturday night. AND they got happy hour every day! Don't we love seeing that. So I started with a Milwaukee spritz which seemed to be like aperol spritz (+ other things?) with the miller beer which was not bad at all. I'm just not much of a beer guy. From there, we just had to get the oysters, which they have options from east and west coast! We tried both and they were both tasty (but obviously had a stronger affinity to the east coast ones #amirite). Lastly, finished with fish and chips cuz its been a while since I had it and boy that fish had an exoskeleton! Outside was soooo beautifully crunchy and the fish was tasty. So filling with the chips eh. I think the only downside we experienced was slightly slow service (i.e. waiting for food and check) but we weren't in any rush!",0
"I really enjoyed my time at this new restaurant! The interior is really cute and the fireplace is a nice touch. The staff were all very nice and accommodating. The lobster avocado salad was my favorite dish, and the seafood was very fresh and well cooked. I especially loved the garlic bread that came with the sauce. The drinks here are also fantastic - I definitely recommend trying them out!",1
"I had a great experience at Pinto! The restaurant is very spacious and has a beautiful outdoor patio/garden area. I was surprised to find that it was quite empty when I visited on a Wednesday afternoon, so I decided to order some chicken wings. The wings were very good - they were spicy and sweet and very crispy. The only downside was that they were quite small, but the price was good overall. The service was really quick, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Was very impressed. Im not a fan of Vegan impersonation food, i think it takes away from the true identity of food (but that's another discussion lol) nonetheless they do it well.The Seitan is to die for. We had the korean wings to start which was more like a hot bbq but it was splendid. Had the Richboy - it had avocado, seitan, special sauce and pickles. I was full and couldn't stop eating it. The fries were underwhelming.The vegan coquito with rum was also on point. I also appreciate the menu and ordering system (you can order everything on your phone) makes it very seamless.",0
"We stopped in for drinks on a weekend and were really impressed by the low-key, inviting atmosphere. The service was excellent, and the waitress had great recommendations. We would absolutely return when we're in the area!",1
"Though pricey, this place was an absolute treat! Their menu had a variety of dishes and we were excited to try quite a few of them. We shared the lamb meatballs and avocado fries and then ordered the chicken dish and crab carbonara. This was one of my favorite pasta dishes and I had plenty for leftovers! The cocktails are creative and quite delicious. I was also pleased to be served mine with a metal instead of a plastic one. There is a variety of seating as well as some TVs in the bar area. I really feel like this place has something for everyone! Unfortunately not the busiest on weekends but hopefully will become more popular and the other bar area can open up.",0
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The lassi wasn't my favorite drink, but it was still pretty good. The curry was delicious and so incredibly filling. I came with plenty of meat, so it could've easily been shared between two hearty eaters. I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I was super excited to see a place with so many good reviews on Yelp, so I naturally had to stop by to see for myself. The drinks were pretty great, with some using soju grape. I didn't see the menu online had the cocktails so I forgot them but mine were a mixture of sweet and sweet and sour so I would recommend any of their drinks. The peanut butter sauce for the summer rolls was too creamy and didn't have that contrast that I usually like with my shrimp summer rolls so it overall came off non-tasteful. The beef pho, I like without brisket and extra eye round...the broth was pretty underwhelming, even with all the condiments added. Service was okay, we had to flag down the servers a couple of times and there seemed to be confusion about who was serving us as we would be approached by different people and we would have to tell them that we just ordered through someone else.",0
"I stopped by House of Joy for lunch today and I was really impressed! The newly renovated restaurant has all the classic dimsum offerings via cart, and the shrimp dishes were fresh and the baos were fluffy - just wish they came a bit hotter. The service was efficient and more welcoming than the average Chinatown spot, and it got pretty crowded by 11 am on the weekends, so I would recommend coming on the earlier side. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and would recommend House of Joy to anyone looking for a classic dimsum experience.",1
"I had a great time dining at Mediterranean Gardens tonight. The decor is simple and nicely done, and the staff was attentive and friendly. We ordered a trio of mezza plates, all of which were delicious. The only downside was that it took a while for our waters and orders to come, and it was a bit odd that the waitress wanted all of our menus back so that they wouldn't get dirty. The restaurant can get a bit noisy because of the high ceilings, but next time I'll try to sit outside. Overall, a great experience!",1
"This Malaysian restaurant is great! The food is delicious and the portions are huge. The service is wonderful, too. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"Ordered delivery through Ubereats and had a great experience! My favorite dishes were the basil udon with veggies and tom yum shrimp soup. Thai iced tea was also perfect. Pad Thai with chicken and grilled skirt steak with jeow sauce appetizer were great, too! 4.5 stars. Next time: I want to try the crispy duck udon.",0
"It's super crowded after work because of their happy hour specials, but once hh ends, it clears out soon after. Don't bother getting that table side guac, they give so little for what they charge and it tastes like all they added were onions to the guac with no other ingredients. The sampler platter was decent, but nothing I'd rave about. The waitresses were nice though, having patience and being accommodating.",0
"I ordered takeout thai green curry recently, and the curry didn't knock my socks off, but it was good and the takeout setup is excellent. The storefront has one door, and the takeout and delivery orders are on a table blocking entry. The people working in the restaurant are a good ten feet away, behind the register. My order was completed very quickly, and then it took me a while to get around to picking it up, but the process was all very seamless and contactless.",0
"I went to Lamia's Fish Market for dinner and ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. The scallops were pretty good, but a bit too salty and didn't have exactly the golden brown crisp that scallops should have. It was on a bed of cauliflower, which was a nice complement to the dish. For $27 though, I would have hoped for a little more than 5 of these scallops and some cauliflower.The best part of this restaurant is the interior decor, which is uniquely ocean-themed and beautiful. The atmosphere is also great for many different occasions: there is upbeat music but it's not too loud for conversation and the lights are dimmed for a more intimate feel. Also, the service speed was pretty quick and the staff was friendly and attentive.Overall, Lamia's Fish Market represents a tradeoff between slightly worse food value and a superior dining environment. As a whole though, I would recommend it to any seafood lover.",0
"Would love to begin ordering at Luckycat, but their delivery app setup is still incomplete and unworking.It seems like not much care was taken to setup the app menu correctly.   The pricing between apps varies wildly.  Motsunabe costs $42 on Grubhub, while it costs $55 on UberEats.  And there are certain requirements that don't make sense.  On UberEats you are required to select ""5 orders of rice"" for an additional +$3 per bowl ($15 total extra cost) in order to even add to cart.Review my photos below for more information.Once the online ordering system for delivery/pickup is working, I will give LuckyCat another look and update my review accordingly.",0
"Cantina is LIT! LolPerfect spot for celebrations. Very high energy, good food, strong drinks & great tunes. My friend and I came here on a Saturday evening with reservations. We got there 30mins early and had to wait for our reservation time as our table wasn't ready yet. They allow you to wait in the roadside dining area.... You can also order drinks there while you wait (love that). Once seated upstairs I immediately felt like I was in a party. The DJ had everyone dancing in their seat or out of their seat. For my appetizer I went with shrimp ceviche (if ceviche is on a menu I'm ordering it!!!!). I wasn't disappointed the avocado chunks made it soooo good. My cocktail choice? Spicy Margarita! Spicy and stronggggg with cayenne pepper on the rim. For my meal I went with the Carne Asada.... The sauce that topped the steak was full of flavor. Our waiter was attentive and service was fast. I'll be back to Cantina again this summer!",0
"I was not too thrilled with my meal at this restaurant. The Chinese food here was not particularly Asian and there was nothing about it that I enjoyed. The General Tso's Chicken was dry, the egg fried rice was different, and the pork dumplings were the only thing worth eating. The bottled water here was also very refreshing, but I can make better Chinese food at home. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Met some colleagues for lunch yesterday. We had the $14 lunch panini special. They had a descent selection of paninis-I had the prosciutto and mozzarella panini. It was a simple small baguette and had some greens (""salad"") on the side. The special also comes with a soda (in glass). The portion was not very large-would be nice to be a big bigger but was ok. A little pricey for lunch. You could hit the deli and get so much more. Service was not super friendly. Outdoor seating was very nice-appreciated the tin roof since it rained pretty hard.",0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The food was very Americanized, and the palate was not up to par. I tried to get my mala fix, but the peanuts were disappointingly tame and it took me a lot of effort to finish the dish. The noodle soup was also only mediocre - I would much prefer the famous Xi'an foods version. Overall, this restaurant is in a good location and the interior is nicely designed, but the food just wasn't up to par.",1
"I thought I wrote a review but I guess I only took photos. I've been here twice. The first time was perhaps a few days after they opened and it was pretty quiet outside of someone there delivering. I went there a second time with one other and it was packed. Both times, the majority of people were speaking Russian.

I stuck with a Plov the first time. The meat was very tender and it was a great portion for the price. The rice was excellent. I was not a big fan of the pita, being a bit hard though the other sesame based bread was better.

The second time, we shared a tomato/cucumber salad. It reminded me of a mix between a Shepherd Salad though without cheese and an Israeli Salad. The dressing was vinegar based and it was good.

She had a Kharcho which was nice and lightly peppery. Very good on a cold day. The meat was quite tender.

I had two kebabs. The lamb neck chop was good but paled to the lulya kebab. I've had this form of kebab in a lot of places and this was easily one of the best I have had. It was packed and",1
"The restaurant was pretty busy, but our waiter was very accommodating and polite. We ordered three apps and five entrees for the table, and everything was delicious. The atmosphere was really festive and fun, and the location in Times Square was great. Overall, we had a really enjoyable experience and would definitely come back.",1
"Verlaine is a trendy restaurant with good service. The food has potential, but we didn't enjoy it as much as we thought we would. The wings were our favorite dish, but the sauce was the lifesaver for us. The drinks were good, and the loungey area was a great spot to watch the art exhibit. We'll be back!",1
"I got the grill cactus taco. Honestly it just was not good. The cactus just tasted like a boiled Brussel sprout. No crisp, no real flavor, no texture just boiled veggie on a taco. We wound up throwing half of it away. Maybe they have something else that would be better but this was a hard pass for me.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the portions were perfect for brunch. My only complaint is that the dishes are a bit on the expensive side, but overall I'd definitely recommend giving this spot a try!",1
"I've been to a small Italian market near my house, but the Eataly does not compare. It was such a fun experience watching the workers make pasta and just to window shop in general. We got the pistachio cannoli which was very standard. It was a little on the sweeter side and definitely very heavy, so it was perfect for sharing. I also got hazelnut gelato (my favorite flavor) and passionfruit sorbet. I got these flavors knowing that they would not go well together (my desire to try both flavors got to the best of me), and I can confirm that these flavors tasted amazing individually. However, it was nice to have a heavier and lighter, tangy flavor to balance the two flavors out. The worker also added the waffle which is free and just for the aesthetic. We also tried the focaccia which was probably the biggest disappointment. The slices we got were a little stale, so maybe if we came first thing in the morning, it would have been better.",0
"I ordered delivery from here twice, and both times the food was good but not $15 good. I'm not sure what dressing it came with, but it wasn't for me. The first time I ordered the Biggs Cobb salad, and the second time I ordered the chicken fingers. Both dishes were good but not great. The chicken fingers were a little dry, but the honey mustard was my favorite thing. I won't be ordering a third time, but I'm sure the food will be good.",1
"The individual pieces were fresh and at $65 the overall value seems good on the surface. My favorite pieces were the scallop and prawn by far. However, the entire experience was way too rushed for us. Our 1 hour seating (6pm on a Sunday) started 10 minutes late because the prior group finished early. Due to starting late, the sushi chefs sped through the pieces, delivering the next piece as soon as the prior piece was done. I was catching up with a friend, and multiple times we felt rushed to interrupt our conversation and eat a piece because they were trying to place the next piece on our plate. The entire 12 courses was finished by 6:40 for us (~30 minutes), which is kind of insane. This left them 20 minutes to make and sell you omakase add-ons at $18+ a piece for those who wanted.Unlike other reviews, we started out with a complementary glass of sake but it was never refilled. We ended up opening a bottle we brought, but in the time it took them to bring us glasses and open the bottle, 5 pieces were already done...Would not recommend or return.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The chicken was very juicy and seasoned well, and the maduros were cooked perfectly - they were sweet and caramelized to perfection. The portion sizes were also very generous, which was great because I was able to take some of the chicken home with me. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",1
"I'm so glad I tried Yo! Thai Cuisine during this pandemic. The food was amazing! I only got the drunken noodles with beef, but it was so delicious. The noodles had a good texture, and the beef was flavorful and good amount of spice/heat. My other friends who tried it loved it too! Highly recommend!",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The decor is so cute and the outdoor seating is a nice bonus. The coffee was great and the staff was friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely be back!,1
"Late Friday night, was able to get a table here without a reservation since it was past normal dinner time. Large classic interior with white table cloths and multi level seating.Wanted to order quickly before the kitchen closed, so opted for the T-bone Steak ($64), Baked Idaho Potato ($10.50), and a draft beer (9?). While waiting for the food to arrive, there is a free bread basket and butter to get you started (not bad). Steak is as enormous as expected, cooked to a perfect medium rare and needing no extra condiments. Potato was only okay, topped with sour cream and chives, but probably needed more to finish it off.Despite the large venue, service comes by often and water gets refilled quickly. Obviously the price point is very high, so would only come back for a lunch special if given the opportunity.",0
"The three of us shared:- 3 sangrias- Gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp)- bacon wrapped dates - croquetas cremosas (comes with a mushroom filled one and a ham and cheese one)- pulpo a la plancha (octopus)- squid ink paella Overall we enjoyed each dish, and the pacing was nice. The squid ink paella had the texture of chopped glass noodles, and we were all pleasantly surprised by it. I would come back here to try their brunch!",0
"I had lunch at this restaurant with my family, for the first time. It's small, but cute, with a lovely outdoor patio, that we couldn't use due to the rain. The owner and his staff were very welcoming and efficient. We ordered the vegetable minestrone, one primavera pizza, two beet salads and one chicken parmigiana. Delicious and very fresh. Prices and portions were good as well. We don't live in the area, but we'll be back for sure.",0
"Went 3 Saturdays ago for an impromptu brunch. Really cool concept, Harlem Public + La Chula + a center bar with lots of cool tables to choose from.I had my eye on Harlem Public so I went for 3 different things so I can try and review: Wake N' Bake Burger (was just okay honestly, I was sold on the hype and how photogenic it is, only ate half), the Chicken and Waffles ( chicken was just 1 pc and so overcooked and dry, almost burnt and the waffles felt like those ready made sugary ones, I was quite disappointed), and wings (these were the only ones I'd order again, decent enough, we ate 3 and I took home the rest of it).  I was underwhelmed honestly, felt like I wasted close to $70-80. So much so that I called Fort Washington Public House to place an order and picked up Truffle Burger on our way back. Sigh. La Chula made up for it. My husband tried their quesadilla and it was actually pretty good. He was so sold he ordered nachos and quesadillas again for delivery the following weekend. The bar was a one man show but she was pretty nice and gave a generous pour when I ordered the Prosecco.Overall a 3.5 to 4, more so for the concept and the nice staff we interacted with.Not sure if Harlem Public had an off day for me. I was really hoping for a great experience.",0
"Gray Hawk Grill is a perfect find for a lovely midday lunch! The double truffle burger with truffle cheese, truffle aioli and truffle fries is delicious, and my husband had the Wellpoint Oysters starter, which was also very good. The pasta was cheesy with the perfect touch of garlic, and the shrimp were jumbo and super fresh. One downside (and I'm not sure of this is a health protocol or not): the restaurant expects you to put together and bag your own leftovers. In that moment, it made a fancy lunch feel like a diner. For such a lovely place (and at the cost), this was a miss. If this is not being done for health-related reasons, I recommend management change this policy ASAP.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant and always recommend it to anyone looking for a good Kati roll. The chicken tikka roll is my favorite, but I'm sad to see that it's no longer on the menu. I hope they bring it back soon!",1
"Overpriced and extremely rude staff! I'm better of making Kati rolls myself at home. One is also not enough for most people as it is a tiny and thin paratha roll. Two is a better idea if you want to feel satisfied. They also charge $1 each for every sauce you may want. What a rip off! Also, recently I tried the Too Good to go app and reserved a Kati roll surprise bag and was shocked at how nonchalant and disrespectful the staff were. They acted like they didn't know what it was and acted like there wasn't any food left. The food was paid for and reserved on the app so I expected to get my food. After some argument with one of the staff, the food was somehow magically found. Terrible! Don't recommend going to this Midtown East location!",0
"I had a mixed experience at this restaurant. The positives are that the setup is great - you get all your utensils and sauces in a plastic bag, which is great for preventing contact. The app ordering was also easy to use. On the negative side, I found their inconsistency to be a big issue. I ordered a beef samosa and they brought out a beef bulanee. I notified the waiter about it thinking it was a tiny mistake that could be fixed, but he let me know that was in fact a beef samosa. I guess the pictures on his menu, Seamless, and Yelp were all confused too. Regardless, I ate it and thought it needed more filling. I liked the crispiness of the dough.

The negatives outweigh the positives, unfortunately. I would not recommend this place overall. The beef kafta was disappointing - it looked very unappetizing and lacked flavor. The Afghani Narenj Pulao with Chicken Korma was delicious, but a bit expensive at almost $20.",1
"I discovered this restaurant on a late Sunday night and I was happy to see the restaurant was opened late. When I arrived I was welcomed and seated quickly. My waiter was friendly and attentive. The reason why I gave the restaurant 3 stars is due to the cleanliness of my table. I found several hairs  on the table cloth. The food was okay I don't recommend the ""juicy dumplings"". The service was good and the food was okay. I don't think I will be visiting again.",0
"Delicious dinner! It was pricey, but it's Manhattan, and it's high quality fish. I really liked the udon soup that came on the side. I couldn't finish, so I wrapped it for later. Better deal!",0
"Octopus was delicious - small tentacles but a lot served. Bronzini was also good - grilled taste was noticeable. Sashito peppers were good - tasted grilled and was well cooked. Baklava was good to share - very sweet and expected. Overall, a good place to eat dinner and worth checking out!",1
"NOTE: in my opinion this place is actually a 3.5* but I'll give it the 4 because it's definitely better than a 3.Been here twice and after both times I feel about the same. While I love the waffles (especially the sweet corn one), I think the chicken and other accompaniments are kinda hit or miss. I most recently had the bbq chicken and waffles and honestly didn't like the sauce at all and the chicken was just ok, thankfully the sweet corn waffle was there to save the day. I've had hit or miss on the drinks here as well, most notably I didn't like the ""Last Day of Summer"" cocktail.Oddly enough, I've had consistently good-to-great dishes from other parts of the menu like the elote appetizer, the biscuits with herbed butters, and the shrimp and grits (one of the few gluten free options on the menu). Also of note, the brussels sprouts are like among the best I've ever had.Overall though, not a bad place at all and I'd definitely visit again. In my opinion though (and the reason I give a 3.5), if you're a chicken & waffles restaurant, that's what should be the best thing on the menu.",0
"this new dimsum spot has definitely gotten a lot of spot light since it came to Chelsea. However, I would say it's a miss for me. The dimsum here is not authentic at all. We ordered very classic, typical dimsum dishes that I would order at any dimsum place and the taste was just not there. If you want to get real authentic dimsum, flushing is the way to go. The pork shumai here was shriveled when they gave it. Not only was it small but the texture seemed to have changed. Same with their har gow (shrimp dumplings). Spare pork rib flavors were totally off with little meat. The only thing redeeming about this spot was the mango sago dessert. This might be a good dimsum spot for manhattan residers who live near chelsea if you need a quick dimsum fix, but I will not be returning.",0
"3 stars for this specific location, otherwise, we love By Chloe.If we stop by By Chloe in NY, it means that we overate on our trip and are trying to recover from food coma. While the meals are light, it certainly doesn't come with lighter price.  We had ordered 2 taco salads, lemonades, and a cookie for around $40. While we want to eat cleaner/light meal, felt like we were jipped on our taco salads as it was literally mostly lettuce in comparison to other locations.  The seasonal mandarin lemonades were just horrible, felt like drinking canned mandarin juice, and the cookie was dry and brittle.  Only thing that really saved the meal was the addicting lemon vinaigrette on the taco salad to power through the lettuce.FYI, one unisex bathroom.",0
"I didn't enjoy my meal at this restaurant. The chips and guacamole were nothing special, and the ropa vieja was bland and boring. I didn't bother eating much of the rice or beans, the beans were almost completely flavorless. I wouldn't recommend this place, especially if you're looking for something special to eat.",1
"Lobster Place was a great place to eat today. The oysters were delicious, and the grilled or broiled oysters with herbs and cheese were my favorite. The grilled lobster was also great. The sushi rolls and fried fish were also good. The service was excellent, and the outdoor seating was really nice. The only downside was that the weather was really cold.",1
"Today was my first time trying brunch here and it was awesome! I was super happy to be able to snag a reservation on Yelp. My friend and I are boozy brunch lovers, which is why we decided on this place. For $22 on top of the purchase of an entree, you can choose between unlimited bloody marys, mimosas, or berry bellinis. I went with the mimosa and they were super tasty and just strong enough! To eat, I got the chicken and waffle sandwich, which comes with potato wedges. I saw a picture of it on Yelp and I knew I needed to try it. It is a whole belgian waffle, with fried chicken, a fried egg, avocado, cheese, and drizzled with maple syrup. Literally all of my favorite brunch things on one sandwich! The chicken was so crispy and stayed crispy as I ate it. The salty/sweet combo of this sandwich made it the perfect lunch entree! I need to come back just to get this sandwich again. I do wish that it came with extra maple syrup to dip in. I'll be asking for a side of syrup next time! The potato wedges were so good and were the perfect accompaniment.The only reason this wasn't a five star experience was the service was a little disappointing. The refills of my mimosa were great, but my friend often had to wait for another bloody. Also, we had to ask multiple times for water and I asked for an extra knife twice and never got it. The food was five stars, but the service was lacking in efficiency. However, I will be back for brunch (and to try the M & M pancakes haha) and am hoping for more seamless service next time!",0
Pros Clean location Nicest location of all the Bros Pizza Slice starts at $ 1.50 Cons Mediocre pizza,0
"I take it very seriously when a place says ""authentic"" next to their banner and instantly that expectation is set. Even worse when it isn't met though...My coworkers and I walk in, immediately a line almost back to the door greets us. Ridiculous anticipation is driving up as we are hungry and analyzing the menu. The options are really good! I decided to go with a Fish, Al Pastor (Pork with Pineapple) & Carne Asada (Steak) Tacos. To start off, the food wasn't warm. It was like room temperature seems like it may have been sitting around and then scooped up when it was time for my order. The fish tacos had no taste, the Chipotle sauce made it bearable. The Al Pastor had no pineapples (big authenticity blunder) and my carne asada was so chewy I couldn't finish it. I'm a big fan of tacos, I've had arguably the best in NYC from trucks, whole in walls and your typical ""fast food"" taco spot, which is what I'd classify this. But my expectations weren't met here. Reason it made it to 3 stars was because they had a stellar assortment of beverages.",0
"The cocktails at this restaurant are amazing! They really make it stand out from the other restaurants in the area. The Japanese speakeasy vibe is really cool, and the small bites I had were all really good. I'm definitely going to come back and try the ramen next time!",1
"Their house made marinara sauce was delicious!!! I recommend you to not be the first in line like what I did. The starting pizza pies sits out so it's not fresh and gets cold. Especially since they don't start serving until 20 minutes after the listed opening time. Waiting in line after the second fresh pie comes out makes this place's experience more worth it!For pizza, my recommendation are the Spicy Spring Pie and the Original Prince Pizza!I honestly still can't decide whether Joe's pizza or Prince Street Pizza is better, so I'll continue to enjoy the best of both worlds! A bite from Joes, and a bite from Prince, then a bite from Joes, followed by a bite from Prince! And repeat.",0
"WORTH THE HYPE!!!This spot got recommended by so many blogs, YouTube videos, and friends that we had to try it out for ourselves. The line can get long at times, but it moves pretty quick as the employees are super efficient. We got a little excited and ordered 5 slices for 2 people. We got the classic Pepperoni, Spicy Vodka, and the Perfection. The Pepperoni is definitely what they are known for and it's probably the best I've had! The slices we got were fresh out of the oven and it was literally perfect. The Spicy Vodka was also delicious and for a meat lover, I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed this slice. Unfortunately, we weren't really feeling the Perfection slice, especially after having the other two. I would definitely come back again whenever I'm visiting New York!",0
"Came here for happy hour and dinner. Covid wise - the tables are a bit close, but there wasn't anyone there when we went so it was fine. vOne of the few places that are offering a happy hour so a plus one to them. They have $3 beers and $6 wines EVERYDAY from 4 - 7! The service was decent, nothing over the top and nothing bad. The massaman curry was great! The perfect amount of spice for someone who can't really eat spicy food. There was also a large amount of chicken in it, almost wish there were some additional greens in there. The curry puffs were great. They come with four and they were delicious and piping hot. For the city, this place is definitely a great spot to stop by if you are doing something in SoHo. It was a quiet area so no one was interrupting us but there are enough people going by that you have something to people watch. The value of the food was a good deal and can't be an every day happy hour! Swing by if you get a chance!",0
"10/25/19 After the Fantasia concert we were hungry from yelling, singing, dancing and straight acting up. lol Side Bar: Tank and Robin Thicke opened for her. I had no idea Robin could dance. Getting down dancing on his piano. He was great. Fantasia was excellent.Okay, back to TSQ. It was fine. 1a so it wasn't crowded. I had a burger and couldn't finish it. It was huge. Good. My girls had no complaints. Just, the dirty utensils  that were on the table they sat us at. Yuck. The staff didn't make us feel welcome, but again it was late.One other dislike. The restroom is on the second floor. They are not catering to the handicapped and infirmed. That was upsetting to me.Would I eat there again? No.Happy Eats",0
"We had a great time at this steakhouse, especially since we got reservations last minute. The building is really historic and the service was great, but the food wasn't as good as we had hoped. Our steak was cooked well, but wasn't very warm. We'll definitely be back to try the other dishes!",1
"4 Charles Prime Rib is a must-go for any steak lover in New York. The burger and chocolate cream pie are both incredible, but be sure to order the bacon-wrapped burger - it's absolutely delicious. The cocktails are also great, and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. The only downside is that the restaurant has a $125 minimum spend, but this isn't really enforced. Overall, 4 Charles Prime Rib is a great place to go for a romantic dinner or a night with friends.",1
"Heard a lot about Jaiya finally got the opportunity to visit. This location we had a brief wait but we sat at the bar and enjoyed some sangha beer. They don't have any beer on tap and only small selection of beers. But good service at the bar. Food wise we got the dumplings they were pretty good. For entrees I got the pad Thai. It was alright, the flavors were decent could of had a lot more flavor. The red curry was really good. The drunken noodles looked great! Next time I would try that. Dessert was alright.Over all decent Thai food place good service decent food. Wouldn't go out of my way to visit but not bad if your near by.",0
"Au Cheval Diner is a great meat-lovers restaurant in Lower Manhattan. I was excited to go try this new location after having a good experience from the Au Cheval in Chicago.This Au Cheval is decorated with dark woods, low lighting and gives you the feel of a nice steakhouse. I liked this Au Cheval better because there was so much more seating.In the Au Cheval in NY, we got to sit at a table instead of the bar. Protip: make a reservation. Esp if going with a large party.Also, they serve coffee at this location. The coffee helped digest the heavy meal. Pro tip: Drink some coffee after your meal to help with the heaviness. Six of us enjoyed this hearty heavy lunch.Fried chicken wings- fried sweet sticky wings. This was def worth ordering. The chicken was tender and the coating was crunchy. Au cheval burger (Single)- comes with two beef patties, pickle and cheese. We added thick cut bacon to two of the three burgers we ordered. The combo of candied bacon, fresh sunny side egg and tender beef patties was heavenly!Roasted bone Marrow- this was roasted with thyme. I loved the caramelized onions with this dish. Halfway through, we ran out of bread. Luckily, we had bread from the burger. Some of us were spreading the bone marrow on top of the burger. This was amazing! Duck Heart Gravy- Such a meaty hearty dish. This also came with a fried egg and was a meal onto itself. Our servers gave us space and were attentive. We had a lovely time! The food was great! The coffee was great too!",0
"I tried Via Carota for the first time a few weeks ago, and overall, I had an enjoyable experience. It was a rainy spring Friday, but the outdoor seating comfortably protected me and my date from the elements. Service was solidly friendly and welcoming throughout the visit, and like many restaurants these days, you can access the menu via a QR code.I shared the artichokes with anchovies and mint and the fava beans with escarole while choosing the stracci with pesto Genovese as my main dish.  The portions were moderately sized, which helped me avoid feeling stuffed, and the food was flavorful yet perfect for a light late lunch. Dessert was an affogato, and it's hard to go wrong with coffee and ice cream! I would definitely return again given the great first impression this restaurant made.",0
"The Crab House All You Can Eat Seafood is definitely a buffet-style restaurant, which can be a bit of a disappointment for some people. However, if you're looking for a place to get a good variety of seafood, this place is definitely worth checking out. I thought the food was decent overall - nothing blew me away, but it was all edible and definitely tasted fresh. The one downside is that the prices are a bit high for what you get, but if you're looking to indulge in a bit of seafood, this is definitely a good option. I thought the service was good, too - our waiters were attentive and quick to bring us our food.",1
"Came for dinner with a friend and had a good experience. We both did the pre-fixe and tried:+ Prawn and salmon+ Summer squash and Stuffed squid+ Pork collar and duck + Sujeonggwa Granita + Blueberry semifreddo+ Fried chicken Honestly, the fried chicken (a la carte add) was the best thing we ate - I liked it more than any of the pre-fixe items. The granita was also incredible. Don't know if I'll be back, though, just because there's a ton of great Korean food in this city. Service was great.",0
I had a pretty good time at Corner Social. I came here on a date on a Wednesday evening when the playoffs were on and it was a very upbeat vibe. We were seated pretty quick. The music was bumping. My food was also pretty good! We had the creamed spinach and chicken spring rolls as appetizers which was tasty and my salmon was cooked to perfection along with the mashed potatoes to bring it all home. Also our waitress was super friendly and checked in with us often. I'd definitely recommend!,0
Checked this place out tonight and what a treat I got. Live musicians playing some of the most beautiful music. Finally got a table on a very busy night. Only about a 15 minute wait. Not bad at all. Wanted to order some empanadas but they were all out. Went to order some alcapuria but they were all out. A little depressing but it was late which means go early for the good stuff. Lol. Then had a salad which is good and springy. Next ordered the soup of the day which was ok. Not a lot of flavor for a chicken soup with carrots and corn. But the main course was on point. Churrasco steak with arroz con gandules . Now this is perfection. Nothing else mattered at this point. This was the real deal. When I was in Puerto Rico and ate at Raices.  I had the same meal and it was just as amazing. For dessert I had empanadas de guayana y queso. That was very delicious. Again great decor. Very intimate and cozy. Very family oriented. Service was ok. Very pleasant just a very busy place. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant.,0
"I had a great time at RH Sunday brunch! The interior is really beautiful, and the attention to detail was great. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful, and took great photos for us at the end. We shared the prosciutto board and the burrata, and both were delicious. The burrata was on another level! The menu is somewhat small but every single entree item seemed tasty. I went with the RH burger and added the thick cut bacon. Absolutely delicious and super filling. I tried some of my friend's salmon and it was amazing. I'd def get that next time. Two friends had the chicken and said it was ok, but lacked seasoning. The truffle fries were good but a little too oily, so we didn't finish them. Everything is a bit pricey, but worth it for the quality of the food. I would definitely come back.",1
"I don't understand the hype about by Chloe. I've had it several times and it's just okay, and very overpriced. Most recently I came to the Rockefeller location for lunch and had the smoothie bowl and it was a disappointing $10. Honestly, it tasted like mostly water because they blended it with so much ice. Plenty of other spots have smoothie bowls that actually taste like smoothies. Sigh. Wrong menu choice, I guess. I wish I got a salad because those looked really good.Overall, fast service given the location and crowd.",0
"I've been to Lamia's Fish Market for bottomless brunch, and not sure if I'd be back. The restaurant interior is absolutely gorgeous and feels like you're eating underwater. Unfortunately, the food was pretty average, and the mimosas were weak. I got the Seafood Flatbread, which honestly just tasted like pieces of seafood on top of flatbread and not a more cohesive dish. The mimosas started off a little stronger, but our 2nd and 3rd pitchers were way more watered down. Bottomless here is $39 which is a bit cheaper than a lot of the other bottomless options in the city, but I wish the food had been better and drinks stronger. My friends agreed with me that this was a pretty average option, so I don't think I'd be back.",0
"I'm a big fan of LTK! I've only ordered takeout or delivery from them, but have always had a good experience. They get the basics like Pad Thai and other rice and noodle dishes right. The prices are fair for what you get. Their delivery has always been reliable when I've ordered, even when the weather is not great. Give them a try if you're in the area!",1
"This is one of my go-to's in Chinatown when I want a cheap, quick, delicious meal.A bit under the radar, this place has been here a while and seems more like a local jaunt vs a stop for tourists. They have excellent Fuzhou classics like peanut wheat noodle, dumplings, and fish ball soup - all at extremely reasonable prices (if you look through the reviews, you'll see they've only raised prices minimally over the past few years, which is incredible).With down-the-street Shu Jiao Fu Zhou often times overrun now given the secret on that place is out, Yi Zhang Fishball offers a very similar menu without having to fight crowds and lines. Hope people out there can support this local business and keep them afloat!",0
The vegan yasai kakiage hot udon was a decent main course at a reasonable price. The udon was thinner than I expected but the portions met my expectations. I would like to come back again to try their nameko udon.,1
"El Jalapeño Taqueria is a great option for Mexican food in the Grove Street area. The prices are very reasonable, and the food is consistently good. The truck is open from day to night, so there's no need to miss out. I particularly enjoyed my spicy pork burrito - it was packed with flavors and very satisfying. The pork isn't too spicy, so you can easily enjoy it without any added heat. The staff is friendly and takes pride in making sure the food is top-notch. I would definitely recommend El Jalapeño Taqueria to anyone looking for a great Mexican meal.",1
"The Pho 5, 6 and 7 are all acceptable eateries positioned near the population centers across Midtown Manhattan.

Pho 7 is next to hotel Pod Times Square.

Pho 6 is on 51st and Third Avenue next to hotel Pod 51.

Pho 5 is on 39th and Third Avenue next to Pod 39.

The banh mi is delicious and filling. 

If not too hungry, it can easily be shared between 2. 

I recommend the combination banh mi that includes cha lua Vietnamese spam, Vietnamese pork salami, and pork liver pate with assorted pickled vegetables. 

At $8 it is an incredible value.

Sadly, I dislike the rest of the items on the menu. 

I have tried the Pho (~$11) which ranks below other Pho restaurants in Manhattan and elsewhere. 

It's passable if you really want some noodle soup though. 

And the portions are big. 

And finally the rice plates (~$10), of which I have included the catfish rice plate below, are similarly lacking taste. 

It's very plain. 

A scoop of rice",1
"I came to this restaurant on a Tuesday evening to meet up for a mini gathering my past professor invited me to. It was trivia night so it was loud, crowded, and busy. The professor already ordered a bunch of food to share amongst the 10-12 of us. I think I was fortunate to try most of the items.



The Margherita Pizza ($16) was standard cheese pizza, but still good. The Truffle Burrata ($18) was fantastic. The Prosciutto Di Parma ($19) was not bad, but not for me. The Taproom Nachos ($16) were not bad, just a bit messy. The Wings ($17) were pretty standard wings. Can't go wrong. The Boneless Wings ($16) were I wasn't a fan of this.



Besides the food, they have a fantastic draft lineup which changes every so often. The service is not too bad for how hectic and busy they are. It would be a spot I'd come back again, maybe not on trivia night.",1
"Hometown is a great hotpot spot in NYC! The AYCE is a great deal, and everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. The service was brisk and friendly, and the setting is really nice. I'd definitely recommend this place!",1
"We came to this restaurant as a group of 5 and had a great time! The service was great, and the atmosphere was cool and trendy. The pasta was absolutely incredible - we had the linguine and the tagliatelle and both were cooked perfectly. The pizza was also very good - we enjoyed it a lot. Overall, a great experience - we would definitely come back!",1
"Ai Fiori is a very professional and expensive restaurant. We went there for a 25th anniversary dinner and opted for a four-course prix fixe. The hand in the kitchen was very skillful, but the meal as a whole was not as great. The pasta course was good, but the seafood risotto was only okay (surprisingly fishy tasting). The veal chop didn't have the kind of exterior crust / interior melt-in-your-mouth tenderness that one expects from a high-end Italian restaurant, and the duck, while good, didn't the kind of transcendent make-you-swoon deliciousness you expect when sending this much on a meal. The dessert was fine. The wait staff was prompt and professional, but perhaps a bit over solicitous. The room was pleasantly quiet - conversation could be conducted easily. As to dress code - we were dressed in cocktail attire since it was a nice evening; I didn't see another suit and tie in the place - overall, a little under-dressed for so expensive a place, but that may be one of those post-COVID things that are here to stay. The wine list was extensive, excellent, and very costly; few bottles were under $100,",1
So grateful for their vegan menu! The Beyond Burger tastes like a real burger. They have so many options! The drinks are always good. Servers are friendly! It's one of my go-to restaurants at many of their manhattan locations!,0
"Royal Seafood Restaurant is a decent option for dim sum in Chinatown, but the food is a bit cheaper and not as flavorful as some of the other options. The chicken feet were a little tougher than I'd like, and the pork was a bit chewier. All things considered, it's a decent option, but I'd recommend some of the other options in Flushing before coming here.",1
"So lucky to have conveniently come across this place in NY K-Town. Very solid Korean food and stood out amongst the other places nearby. My group and I started with a fried small fish, which was crispy and delicious. Never knew we would get one- nice surprise! For starters, we got the seafood pancake as well as the tteokbokki. The pancakes were a bit oily and not crispy enough for our taste, and the tteokbokki was okay, lacking texture. For the main, I got the kimchi+beef soondubu that came w/ the tofu stew and a bowl of rice. The sides that came with our table were good, but not my favorite. The kimchi wasn't as flavorful- lacking some spice and sour. The soup and rice were very filling and warm, perfect for a cold day. Overall everything was great, especially the kind service and hostess, but nothing about the food was particularly memorable. Still solid though!",0
"This restaurant is not worth your time or money. The service was terrible and the food was barely edible. The atmosphere was beautiful, but the quality of the food and drink was not up to par. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
I love that this place is open 24/7 and they specialize in my favorite comfort food. It's a solid establishment on the second floor above Five Senses.Their radish kimchi is consistently awesome and they have all the accompaniments you need for your meal. I have yet to try some of their other offerings but I'm looking forward to it.,0
"I found myself in the neighborhood during an assignment for work and it's truly a neighborhood restaurant, as it was an itch to get to by local transportation. After a worth-while trek, I had a hard time deciding between the John Roti sandwich or the Satay Peanut Noodles. So, naturally I bought both. *oink*

The decorum brings to wonder if the restaurant is still in the process of opening or transitioning to the covid trends of takeout or closing. I found myself awkwardly trying to find a place to sit, so I instead decided to read a news article (also awkwardly positioned) on the wall behind a plant. It's a cute origin story of the restaurant that's worth a read as you wait for your order.

Normally on the off-occasion that I find myself in a Singaporean restaurant, I opt for some rectum scorching Laksa noodles, but as of late I've been hankering for some peanut noodles and according to previous reviews this seems to be the wiser choice. I also normally wouldn't pay any mind to the Roti sandwich but was recommended through a listicle from a well-known food publication that rhymes with Peter. This has taught me the valuable",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at P.S. Kitchen! The staff were so friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was really cozy and inviting. The food was delicious, and I especially loved the fried chicken with bleu cheese sauce - it was a perfect combination of crispy and juicy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal in the city.",1
I don't know why a lot of my friends don't care for this place but personally I like it a lot. The food is very good and it's definitely authentic Chinese flavor. The vibe here is amazing. Live music is really cool. After 9pm the place was like a night club. Pretty dope. Overall I like the place a lot and I'd definitely take my friends from out of town here.,0
"Super Taste serves up some delicious noodles and dumplings. It's a small joint with limit seats and your typical Chinatown service. But prices are cheap, and taste is good. I actually like their bao's quite a bit too.",0
"The service, the flavor and the quality is there, but I don't know if I'd come back. This is a place if you want to splurge for a more luxurious kbbq experience compared to the other kbbq places located in ktown. We got the rib eye, marinated short rib, seafood stew, and the busan cold noodles. Our server was great and cooked the meat perfectly well as medium rare. She was also super helpful in splitting the stew and noodles into two portions. I do recommend this place if you're feeling bougie  and open to trying a new place at least once for kbbq!",0
"I really enjoyed my time at Harlem Tavern! The outdoor seating is really cute and the happy hour prices are great. I especially loved the truffle fries and the calamari - both of which were really tasty. My only complaint is that the salmon was a bit dry for my taste. Otherwise, I'd definitely come back!",1
"I came to this restaurant with high expectations and was not disappointed. The stuffed peppers (gemista) were traditional, but I thought the cheese mixture inside was unidentified. The gyro was good, and the french fries were a nice touch. The service was polite, and the small tables were a bit difficult for a group, but overall it was a pleasant experience. I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
This restaurant is underrated - I don't understand why but their burgers are really good! I had one there recently and it was really good. The service was also really friendly and attentive. The place is clean and has pictures of Nuatet all over it. The burgers were cooked to perfection and the portions were right - you don't leave feeling hungry at all. The fries were also really good - crunchy on the outside and smooth on the inside. I liked the truffle mayo too. I would definitely recommend this place.,1
"I'd say this halal car is just a little better than your average halal cart. I live uptown where halal carts don't have fish options so I love coming towards Midtown and being able to get a cheap fish sandwich. At this catr, the sandwiches are five dollars and the platters are six dollars. Pretty good compared to if you go 10 blocks further south. On their menu, they didn't have an option for fish sandwiches so I had to ask if they do that (I only saw an option for Fish platter) they said they would make the fish sandwich for me and at the end of it they asked for six dollars. I thought that was weird because every other sandwich - lamb, chicken, falafel - was five dollars. They let it go and took the five dollars but that felt strangely like they were trying to get some money out of me?Either way I enjoyed the sandwich. They put chickpeas in it and I think that's what really made it taste so good. This area doesn't have many fast food options so among your choices, this is a good one.",0
"The first time I went for a late night event, I was very unimpressed with the tacos. They were not even 20 percent as good as the tacos from Los Gatos #1. Therefore, I was very hesitant to go a second time, but I was glad I did for brunch as they had some great drink deals. The Paloma was delicious for about 8 dollars and the tacos tasted better as well. I'm not sure if it was because the day was still early and the ingredients were fresher or that it wasn't half as busy so they had time to actually prepare better tasting tacos. I would come again during the day, but still wary about going in the evening.",0
"José Andrés' new restaurant, Hudson Yards, is a behemoth of a project, and it's already proving to be a popular spot among food lovers. The small vendors and bars that are open so far are bustling with activity, but it's still not too crowded. We started our meal at the patatas bravas station, and the patatas were very good - crispy and with a good flavor in the aioli and sauce. Next, we tried the Paella Valencia (Chicken & Rabbit) from Leña, which wasn't officially open for sit-down dinner. The paella was disappointing tbh, it wasn't too flavorful and you get one scoop of it on a small plate for $17 which isn't great value.

The best was for last which was the ""Bar Celona"" which was a tapas bar. The Olive bite was a clever and flavorful punch of olive-flavor. The croquettes were solid but I've had better. The shrimp tapas was very good with a nice garlic sauce. The calamari was solid but could've been crispier. And to wash it all down in proper fashion was the Parrón of Spanish beer and lime soda. They do have a",1
"I was invited here by my son and his wife for dinner while visiting in Manhattan upper east side. We made reservations for 3 but they accommodated one additional guest as a last minute request. We were seated in their patio enclosure which was heated by 4 gas torch posts, which worked nicely as long as the enclosure door was kept closed. Unfortunately, the door was often left open by staff and guests as they walked in and out. We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers ( corn fritters or sorullitos and meat empanadas and these were served relatively promptly, but the main entrees, which we ordered at the same time as the apps, were served after an inordinately long wait, and this prompted the manager to give us a discount on the total bill. In regards to the food, the empanadas were tasty and the mofongos were reasonably good, but the sauce in the seafood mofongo was overly salty . I also found the corn fritters to be relatively plain tasting. The cocktail that we all enjoyed was a mango pisco sour that had a nice balance of tartness and fruitiness. In all, this restaurant has potential to deliver a better culinary experience with some improvements in their service and their food preparation. Although normally my rating would have been in the 3 to 3 1/2 range, I appreciated the manager's effort to address the delayed service.",0
"I went here a while back after going nearby for dinner.As it was very hot out, I stopped here as I am big fan of teh tarik or pulled tea. The version here was refreshing and fine though compared to my preferred Malaysian place (Rasa,) it was too sweet and the tea flavor wasn't strong enough. I also decided to get a pulut inti as I wanted a light sweet snack. This is a type of kue and it consists of sticky rice flavored with morning glory and topped with sweet coconut also wrapped in a banana leaf. The rice had a nice color but it lacked flavor but this is pretty common for the rice in this dish so the topping added some good coconut sweetness. It was also perfectly fine. The staff member I spoke to you was nice. I wouldn't mind trying more of the menu as they have some harder to find Malaysian dishes and I love Malaysian cuisine but of what I tried, it was fine.",0
"I wanted to like this place, since I'm a big ramen fan. Went a few times and tried various bowls, before posting this review.Pros:-cool looking decor, very hip-ok ramen, decent productCons:-too costly for the food that you do get-meager portions-thin sliced pork, a no no in my book-the dishes are 'inventive' in ways that I'm not fond of, I'm more of a traditionalist-slow disinterested service (I'm not here to look good, I came to eat; please serve me instead of having to flag you down since you are actively ignoring your customers)-place full of foodie poseurs taking food pics and talking loudly about how important their self absorbed lives are instead of eating-the wait, hallmark of a true ramen place is you get in order eat then leave...this isn't that place. multiple times I came here had to wait.Net net, come here if you want to eat ok but expensive ramen at a hip looking place full of poseurs while being under-served by waitstaff. There are many other ramen places in the city to try, this is just one. Just one person's opinion.",0
"Cute outdoor seating with a spring feel. It can get a little loud since the space is a little small (indoors and outdoor). Highly recommend making a reservation because it does get really packed! The food is very authentic and delicious. I deducted a star because the prices are on the higher end and it can feel slightly cramped since all the tables are very close to each other. My friend and I did have to raise our voice a few times because we couldn't hear other due to the background noise. Covid is still going on, I would recommend spacing the tables out a little more",0
"Joshua Tree is a great place to watch a game, with reasonable drink prices and a fun atmosphere. The service is great, and the restaurant is always clean. The only downside is that the restaurant can get a bit crowded, but that's to be expected in a place like New York City.",1
"Coming to Joes over the past few yeArs has been .... a journey.I'm not sure of the words I'm looking for there, but to clear it up:Joes is a staple, you know joes, at its' best, joes pizza with its' thin crispy crust and saucy cheesy divinity has a religious type of following.   For the fore-mentioned results you need to be lucky though; I've been disappointed by Joes many many times in the past, I've also been quite pleased however.  Are they a five start, perfect every time, doing something unique, amazing ingredients amazing results sort of place?  Certainly not, but they have an established track record and in my opinion, this is one of the greats. Maybe it's like Dinero before he started thinking he should do comedy and watered down the monster persona... Joes too has evolved, and sometimes that evolution is to devolve a bit.This all sounds pretty negative so I'll say, depending on the location, depending on the night, depending on the order, depending on the gods and stars and rotational axis of the earth relative to Saturns' rings, you may have an excellent pie, slice, or experience.... Or you may not; good luck on your journey!This location is one of the better ones (3.5stars) in my opinion but do a ton of business which can be an issue in quality from time to time.     I'll post from the West Village spot soon ...for yelp comparison reasons of course.",0
"My boyfriend and I came here on a summery Friday for our date night. I had been wanting to visit Kuxe for a while after seeing it on Instagram. We were offered the option of sitting inside or on the street but asked if we could sit in their outdoor dining structure instead. They told us we could only sit there an hour and opted for that option as the other seating was very close to other patrons.We started with a few cocktails which were excellently crafted and very delicious. Quickly after, we were served the Tacos de Birria, which neither of us have tried but both enjoyed a lot. The consommé added an amazing amount of flavor to the tacos. We drank the consommé afterwards and were very impressed by how flavorful and hearty it was.We had a little bit of an issue picking the main course but ended up settling on the Molcajete dish. We were amazed by the sizzling stone pot with steak, cheese, shrimp, and chicken and a few sides. Despite being a mix of many different things, everything was delicious. We left Kuxe feeling very full and content. Overall we had a very positive experience here and I would not hesitate to return to try their other options.",0
"Overall, it's a nice place to sit down and have lunch and enjoy a selection of appetizers and cocktails. Beautiful ambience and quick service. Makes for a very relaxing experience. This place does get packed at night on the weekends so I highly suggest making a reservation. If not, you might be waiting for a while.I ordered the fish tacos and they were pretty good, not too fishy if that makes sense LOL. I honestly can't remember what cocktail I got but it is pretty good. All of their cocktails and appetizers looked appealing and to find a place that has great food and an extensive list of cocktails that are delicious actually isn't that easy. So take advantage!",0
"I love these happy hour seafood spots. Even when you don't feel like the HH menu deal is that amazing, the marketing of it just makes you want to order everything. $1 ousted are fantastic. $1 cherrystones is an option. Fried lobster ravioli and mussels were all great appetizers to start. The paella was ok. Nothing to boast about. The fish and chips were very good. Perfectly fried and golden delicious.",0
"The East Village pizzeria has quickly become one of my favorite spots in town, thanks in part to their friendly and accommodating staff. The pizza is absolutely delicious, with a variety of toppings and crusts to choose from. The vodka is a nice touch, and the eggplant pizza is a personal favorite. The only downside is that they don't have a lot of gluten-free options, but they do offer garlic knots and white pie with Mike's hot honey. The ranch is a great addition, and I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area.",1
"I'm very impressed with this new restaurant! The atmosphere is really nice and the service is great. The only downside is that the portions are a bit small, but everything else was really good. I especially enjoyed the Bulgogi and the Seafood & Scallion Pancake. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"Tacovision is a great option for Happy Hour and Taco Tuesdays. The tacos are alright, but their prices are affordable and I loved their drinks. I'd recommend their Chicken Nachos.",1
"Came in with a reservation at 6 pm for a team HH/dinner. It was a Wednesday so in addition to their 4-7 HH drink specials ($6 select beers, $7 house wines, $8 select cocktails), they also had half off bottles of their happy hour wines. We started with one of their happy hour bottles and it was meh. Then we decided to just do a regular bottle and it was still meh.The food was also meh - at least what I ordered. We started out with the margherita flatbread - no complaints there. Nice and cheesy. But for my main, I had the Korean BBQ Chicken Sandwich (crispy chicken breast, gochuchang sauce, arugula, red cabbage slaw, brioche bun). The sandwich was literally dripping with sauce. It was so salty, all I could taste was the gochuchang. Plus, brioche buns aren't exactly conducive to all the sauciness, so it was very messy to eat. I couldn't finish it and was left parched afterwards, no matter how much water I drank. The fries it came with were good though. I wouldn't come back so I hope nobody tries to pick this for another team outting.",0
"The Horny Ram never fails to amaze us with their SPECTACULAR cocktails and food! We got the Popcorn Cauliflower with Cajun mayo (so good) and the Buffalo chicken chicken nachos. For drinks my hubby got the Horny in New York, was as amazing as its name! 

And I got Poison Ivy (very refreshing). The Horny Ram definitely lives up to its name - their cocktails are delicious and their food is even better! I highly recommend the Buffalo chicken chicken nachos - they're so delicious and full of flavor. The Horny Ram is definitely a restaurant we'll be returning to!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The Negroni was great and the montepulciano was tasty. The Caesar salad had plenty of anchovies, and the pasta pescatore was delicious. They have indoor seating and are following the rules. I'm glad I stumbled upon it because they were not listed as having indoor dining. I will definitely come back even after COVID.",1
"Underwhelming. I think KazuNori is overrated and I don't understand why it has 4.5 stars. Sushi rolls are okay. Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular. No inspirational sparks on the taste buds. Go if you want to spend $30 on sushi. Don't go if you're expecting to be blown away.",0
"A very very good ramen shop to add into a city full of them. A pretty spacious place with both high tops and regular tables. Came pretty early on a Friday night, it got busier as we were leaving.We started with chicken karaage and shisito peppers. The karaage is a bit different from other ramen places, not exactly the Japanese style I'm used to, reminded me more of some very good and crispy popcorn chicken. It comes with a side of spicy mayo and it was pretty spicy. The shisito peppers were pretty solid. Not bad if you're usually a fan of them. I got the miso ramen with pork, they ask if you want pork loin or pork belly. Pork loin is the chasu slices most ramen places give. I do appreciate that they give you an option of pork belly. The soup base was very rich, and the pork was sliced very thing which I think is better than thick slices. I also got a side of beef tongue. The texture was fine but at too salty for my liking. My boyfriend got the tonkotsu with pork loin and duck. Really liked the duck! It was also thinly sliced. He enjoyed his meal as well. As for the noodles themselves, they're on the thinner side but not as thin as the noodles you'd get from ichiran. The noodles were cooked well, but I would like them to be even more firm. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area.",0
Elite was great! The service was great and the food was even better. I really enjoyed my time there and I would definitely recommend it to others. The music was great and the atmosphere was perfect. I even lost my Gucci wallet but Elite was able to help me out and find it. I really appreciate their customer service!,1
"Expensive but decent food (just be aware it's very Americanized). It's sort of like the Koi of Manhattan West. Love the Brussel sprouts and pop rock shrimp tempura. Also got the miso black cod, Katsuya roll (wrapped in cucumber), and the baked crab hand rolls, which weren't bad. I recommend making a reservation. It was packed when we showed up on a Thursday night but were able to just sit at the sushi bar. For drinks, stick with sake and then maybe wine. All of the cocktails were pretty terrible, esp the cucumber margarita. They taste like some cheap artificial syrup was put in them. They also have a private dining room on the other side of S Bar, that is nice. You need a 20 person minimum I think and it has good pre-set options, though I thought it needed a little more food. We did a party there and I left still hungry. I enjoyed the pop rock shrimp, California rolls, and the beef tenderloin toban with mushrooms but thought the chicken breast was pretty terrible. Will have to come back to try other items!",0
I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant! The food was really tasty and the service was great. I especially loved the fact that it wasn't swimming in sauce - I really appreciate that. The fruit that they gave us at the end of our meal was also really delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to others.,1
"I had high hopes for Madame Vo, and I'm glad I finally got a chance to try it. The decor is really cool, and the space is a bit small but manageable. The wait here can be a bit frustrating, but it's worth it for the delicious food.

The bowl of beef broth was huge, and the flavors were really strong. I especially enjoyed the 24-hour beef broth. The short rib was a bit of a miss, unfortunately - it was tough and fell off the bone, but the other ingredients (including the short rib cubes, fried sunny side up egg, and small bowl of white rice) made up for it.

The Bo Luc Lac flavors were really good, but the oily texture and small portion of the dish made it a bit disappointing. The Nem Nuong Springs rolls are not worth it - they're only filled with lettuce and vermicelli, and the nem nuong flavor is very faint.

Overall, I had a really enjoyable experience at Madame Vo, and I would definitely recommend it to others. Prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food is definitely worth it.",1
Almost thought it was closed except for takeout when I got to the restaurant. They didn't really have their outdoor seating set up and the restaurant is very dark inside. Walking in you see it's a narrow space with a decent amount of seating and the tables nicely spread out.We stuck to ordering vegetarian dishes so my friend and I could share. We asked for a recommendation for which lentil dish to try and got the Dal Makhani (black lentils). I loved it! We also ordered Kadhi Paneer. The description said it's in a spicy sauce but it didn't taste spicy at all. Very flavorful. The onions and peppers were nicely cooked. And of course you must get an order of naan! Had the garlic naan and it was so good! It actually had garlic flavor!,0
"The 4 stars was all about the food and all I had was brussels sprouts and the mac & cheese. The good tasting food made up for the hour and a half wait.... *which is another story*. I was pleased and so was everyone at my table who all ordered something different. I'm glad I have leftovers to try it all again tomorrow. One more thing... All of the servers with the black shirts, who assisted us in any way was very polite. Thanks gentlemen!",0
"I had a great time at this Korean restaurant! The banchan was amazing - the amount and quality of banchan matched the price you're paying for your meal. The meat here is some of the best I've ever had - it's only beef and it's the best quality kind. The kimchi short rib fried rice - huge and filled with ingredients! Well worth the price. The only downside is that the lettuce wraps and sauces are expensive. But overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it!",1
"Chick'nCone is a delicious concept, and I think it will translate well to other areas as the brand expands. Located in the Underground Market, this place is awesome and relatively affordable. My first Chick'nCone experience was actually in Bryant Park during the summer, and again at the Winter Market there. It's a nice treat and extremely easy to eat on the go. The fries are good, though the real winner here are the awesome cones with a variety of flavors (my preference is the buffalo bleu cheese one). Service here has always been great, and ordering is easy as can be. While there isn't a ton of seating near here, you can still snag a seat if you time it right.

I wish Chick'nCone much success in their franchising efforts. The restaurant industry is a tough business, though with this unique and high-quality product (that is very IG-friendly too!), I think they'll make it. Overall, I give the restaurant 4.5 stars.",1
"We just found out that the Good Stuff closed about two months ago.  We began eating there nine years ago this month and it quickly became our very favorite place.  Beginning in mid-2013, we met two friends there for dinner approximately once/month - but we ate there that often from the very beginning, and even sometimes in-between meeting our friends.  The same manager (Gregory) worked there during all those years, as did several of the servers.  We loved the food and the ambiance, plus the space was large enough whereby we could sit there for a long time when together with our friends.  We also brought a few other friends there over the years, and they all loved it.We last met our friends for dinner at the Good Stuff nine months ago and then the coronavirus struck.  We were all looking forward to the time when we could resume eating there.  We'll really miss the Good Stuff....",0
"Adel is a middle eastern halal food cart and they are so much better than the Halal Guys mainly because they marinate their meat and their white sauce is also much more flavorful and their hot sauce is much more spicy. They also accept credit cards. The average wait is about 10 minutes but a bit longer on late Saturday evenings. We came here once on a Saturday evening via car and we were able to find a parking right on that block... but otherwise, it's mostly taken.P.S.: if you order any sauce on the side, make sure you look in your bag before leaving because a lot of the times they forget.",0
"Au Cheval is definitely a unique restaurant - it's beautiful, but the food is really what stands out. The burger is huge and delicious, and the service is great too. I definitely recommend this place!",1
"The place is a cool concept- simple healthy food prepared well. I've tried different locations a few times, this is my least favorite. Last time I went all the food was cold & the hostess was very rude. Not worth $20+ for vegetables & rude waitstaff. Won't be coming back.",0
"""An Choi"" is a place really worth checking if you're in the lower east side. The food here is overtop, it can get busy inside and it's not the biggest place so it could take a while to be seated on the weekend. The Pho is delicious, worth the price, can be really filling and perfect for those cold days. The taro fries is a good starter, as well as the Sriracha wings.  The shaking beef is also another good entree, it's a good amount, comes with white rice, arugula salad and thick pieces of steak. Overall the prices here are fair, you're looking at anywhere between $15-$20 for a meal. I would avoid sitting in the back, it tends to get hot because the kitchen is right there. Service is always good, however I've noticed if you place an order to go, they usually tend to skimp and give a smaller plate compared to eating inside. Check this place out, if you're around.",0
"I think they were having a rough night. We got two of the three items we ordered. Then waited a very long time. Finally we just asked for our bill, which had the three items on it. Insert eye-roll. What we did have was ok. Not anything I'd recommend for people to go out of their way to get.",0
"Dim Sum Palace is a great place for dim sum. The shrimp dumplings and steamed spare ribs were my favorites. The prices are a bit high, but overall the food was great. The only downside is that the prices on the menu were different than what the server told us.",1
"This is a chain from Flushing, and opened up here in the St. Marks area right beside NYU - smart move for students craving a bit of dry hot pot.The restaurant is new looking, and clean, a lot of staffers and you can choose your meat (by the pound) and veggies (by the basket). There are a lot of different choices but you can mix and match (thought not as many as the ones in Flushing). The spicy levels are really just no spice, small (hot enough for me), medium and very spicy. The rice is extra, and the cost is a little higher than Flushing's restaurants (at least the last time I went to the food court).Spicy and ma as much as the Flushing restaurant, same subset of flavors, but not enough salt - will have to cook it again at home to add a bit more salt in.",0
"Whoa! Totally impressed with this spot and would highly recommend. I would even say it's a vegan alternative to In-and-Out but better because it's black owned. The ice cream machine was out of service (giving McDonalds vibes Jerrell! lol) but the owner was there and I overheard him say they're working on it. Someone did say their milkshakes are really good so I'll have to come back to give those a try. It is a small location, they have standing room on the side with a ledge to eat and a couple of places to sit outside, some with coverage. Definitely check this place out. I'll totally be back soon!",0
"I visited this restaurant for dinner and it was quite busy. I ordered the rigatoni & gamberi, which is spicy shrimp with pasta. I must first say the flavor was fantastic - the red sauce is rich but not overpoweringly sweet or salty like a lot of pasta dishes. Same goes for the cheese; complements the dish well but isn't too thick or heavy. The shrimp was listed as spicy but in all honesty didn't taste spicy at all, which wasn't a problem, but just something to note. My only bone to pick is portion size - it's not a ton of food for the price, and I still left a bit hungry, but I really did enjoy the flavor profile overall. Service was also very friendly. I did have to flag them down though to get my order in (we had sat waiting for a bit), but once we got our orders in the rest of service was great too. A great try, but perhaps on occasion.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but I didn't love it. The portions were small, and the prices are high for what you get. I would recommend ordering a few dishes at a time to avoid waiting. The pork knuckles were my favorite dish, but I felt the noodles could have had more flavor. The Fried Pork Buns were good, but smaller than usual. The yuxiang shredded pork was my favorite, and the size was good. The dan dan noodles were good, but again, small portion.",1
"We had heard GREAT things about BondST and it didn't disappoint!  The food is insanely fresh, beautiful, unique and delicious.  The presentation (my personal favorite) is much better than most as well.  Their sauces are creative and perfectly paired with each dish and or roll.  Our server was wonderful.  The only note I have is ... they gave us clean plates yet returned the same dirty silver for the next course ... idk, dirty flatware seemed not to fit the experience?  Tuna Pizza might not taste great in my dessert?  But seriously I feel like they're above this. That said, such a wonderful evening at an amazing spot!  Can't wait to go back!",0
"There is nothing better than homemade pasta! I am so happy that Aunt Jake's now has a location in the UES. I have ordered from here so many times! My go to order is the classic rigatoni with arrabbiata sauce. A second close favorite is their herb garganelli in the roasted garlic pecorino or the calamari. If you have a sweet tooth, the tiramisu is one of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend Aunt Jake's!",0
"A coworker recommended this place to me and I'm glad I took a walk to check it out! Ordered the Palermo on sfilatino bread: sopressata, fresh mozzarella, hot peppers, arugula & then tacked on a little truffle oil. $16+ for a sandwich but as the hundreds of other reviews state: It's HUGE! I wound up eating half and saving the rest (but to be real, I could probably eat another half of that half. Come on, where are the Italians?! We EAT!) Lots of flavor and the truffle aroma floated through the air when I unwrapped it. Fresh bitter arugala, spicy peppers and large peppercorns throughout the sopressata made for one flavorful sandwich. Solid spot for authentic Italian sandwiches.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant after work and was pleasantly surprised! They have a great selection of steamed rice rolls, and the portions are huge! The owner and staff were super friendly, and I'm glad to see they're doing well. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good meal.",1
"I've had a great experience at this restaurant. The food is always delicious and the service is always friendly. I especially love the lunch pad see iew which is like drunken noodles with beef. The chicken wings are also a favorite of mine. They can be a bit salty, but overall I've had a great experience.",1
"Great concept and delicious. Basically it is sweet tofu skin pouches filled with seasoned seasoned rice with your choice of toppings.  Almost like sushi but with a tofu wrapper instead of seaweed.  I tried the spicy tuna, crab, roe, and teriyaki mushroom.  Ordered the beef bulgogi and spicy pork for family.  All agreed that they were fresh and tasty. Pricing is about 3.50 for one.  I think I that it's fair and would go back.  Recommend!",0
"Moderate sized Korean restaurant specializing in on-table BBQ. Saturday night, not crowded at all, as I was able to sit down without any wait.Menu is extensive with all sorts of selections for both BBQ and single dish options. Went for the Short Rib Bibimbap ($18), and a bottle of Pomegranate ""Good Day"" Soju ($15). Drink comes out first - a 375ml bottle of cold flavored soju that tasted a lot like medicine and only became acceptable after the alcohol hit. Bibimbap is served in a hot stone pot with a layering of rice, meat, veggies, and egg. Meat was more burnt than it should been, though the egg was perfectly runny to complement the rice. Yelp check-in offers a free Dumpling appetizer - several fried pieces of beef dumpling that was probably the best part of my meal.Service here took it's sweet time to get my order in as well as for the check, while the dishes were delivered quickly. Wasn't feeling the food all that much, so probably won't try the BBQ options.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good but it's definitely on the pricier side. The Lobster Roll was especially good and I would definitely recommend it. The Cornbread was also really good and I would definitely order it again. The Grilled Caesar & Shrimp Ceviche was also really good and I would definitely recommend it. The only downside is that I think the entrees could be a bit more affordable.",1
"The outdoor dining set-up was spectacular on a blocked off street. It was definitely a busy night. We sat at a table of four on the road. There was no garbage around. Only cute dogs walking by with their owners and the occasional bicyclists. We ordered a bottle of chardonnay that was very good. Unfortunately, we did not quite like the food as much as we had hoped/anticipated. It started out well with the Brussel sprouts, which was probably one of the highlights of the meal. The coconut rice was also recommended to us, but I didn't enjoy it. It came in a fried ball of coconut rice that did not taste like coconut. We shared the pig buns. The pork was very deliciously cooked, but the buns were a little soggy to our liking. For the large plates, we shared the salmon curry, which was my favorite large plate of the night, but very expensive for 42 dollars with one piece of salmon on a bed of bok choy. We then had the ribs, which everyone found too sweet as well as the fried chicken dish, which was also too sweet. Some of the fried chicken pieces were very dry. Lastly, the prawns and noodles came out and this kind of cinched our overall review of this place. We were so disappointed by the texture and the taste of the noodles. The noodles were flat noodles that you find in your typical Thai dishes like pad see ew or drunken noodles or your typical Chinese dish like the beef ho fun. This was by far the most disappointing noodle dish I've (we've) had. Overall, I think we had an average experience.",0
"Made reservations through Open Table for a brunch on a Sunday and we were seated immediately when we came in. Highly recommend making reservations since the place is tiny.I didn't try any drinks but my friend got the Bellini and mimosas and liked it.For my entree, I got the scrambled egg with cured salmon and it did not meet my expectations. The flavor was missing and it tasted very bland. Came with a side of fries and side salad, which were fine. My friend got the Croque Monsieur and liked it. For dessert, we tried the Apple Tarte Tatin and it was highly disappointing. Both texture and flavor were not good. We literally took one bite each.Overall, I didn't have a good experience.",0
"This restaurant is terrible in terms of service! I've been here for late night drinks before and didn't have a problem, but my roommate and I got here for brunch one Sunday and asked for a table outside since the weather was nice (a little windy but the sun was out). We were pointed to a table and as we walked to the table, the wind blows a napkin off one of the tables and the wait staff points to the napkin telling my roommate to pick it up. It wasn't even our table!Then we sat and waited at least 20-25 mins without any service. Nobody came by with water or to take our order and the restaurant was pretty empty. We eventually just got up and walked across the street to Good Enough To Eat where they had amazing service.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was friendly and the food was delicious. I ordered the sushi combination lunch special and it was a great choice. I loved the variety of sushi that was included and the presentation was really nice, too. My friend also had a great time here and she loved her spicy tuna roll. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"The sandwiches at this restaurant are huge, so it's definitely a good idea to share one between two people. I wasn't a huge fan of the Italian ham in my sandwich - it was a bit too strong for my taste. The other ingredients were good, but the sandwich as a whole just didn't taste that great to me. The bread was the best part of the sandwich for me, though. I would definitely come back for some bread, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend the sandwiches here.",1
"Met up with friends for a nice meal and drinks before one of our friends returned to Mexico. It was a great time! The server was pretty awesome, and everything was pretty timely considering the size of the party. It was absolutely silent while everyone indulged in their food so I guess that means it was pretty delicious. Lol The appetizers were on point and we didn't leave many scraps or have leftovers. Also, the drinks were perfection! Looking forward to another trip here soon!",0
"I had a great time at Mikado. The food was delicious and the service was great. The prices have gone up, but it's worth it for the great food and service. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone.",1
"Shukette is a great place for a night out with friends. The atmosphere is funky and the outdoor seating is very comfortable. The service is great and the food is delicious. The only downside is that the restaurant is quite busy, so make sure to reserve a table in advance.",1
"I was really underwhelmed with my experience at this restaurant. The food was just weird and didn't taste great. The mozzarella sticks were great, but the pasta and pizza were both terrible. I'm not sure what the restaurant was going for, but it didn't work for me.",1
"Konbini is a great place to go for a quick bite or to get your caffeine fix. The food is definitely Japanese-inspired, with some interesting flavors and ingredients. The service can be a bit slow and unenthusiastic, but the food is worth it!",1
"I came here for lunch while doing a business around the area. I just happened to walk pass it because I got hungry right around lunch time. Curious to find out more about this place. It's a place that you order by the counter and wait for your number and then you sit and eat there or take to go. There're quite a lot of tables including high tables. The wait for each order is about 5-10 mins. After getting my order, I sat by the window at a regular small table. I declare that cousins make very good lobster rolls! I finished the pickle and coleslaw too. In addition to that, they sell some macaroni and crab cake in a box to take home and heat up yourself at home. Feeling lazy? That's a box for that! Nice! The service was very good too.",0
"I've been to Maman Tribeca a few times now and really enjoy some of the items on their menu, such as the lavender latte, chocolate chunk cookie, and papa's breakfast bowl. Their staff has been very nice in the past, but that seems to no longer be the case. I was waiting for my Ritual order to be prepared, and it was taking a bit longer than usual (30 minutes), but most of the staff was nice about it. However, one waitress by the name of Gabby or Maddie was very rude and wouldn't let me sit down, citing that ""this is a full on restaurant"" as if I was of a different class because I had ordered ahead. When I explained that I was planning on dining in but had ordered ahead to avoid the wait, she accused me of ""being hostile"" to her, which was absolutely ridiculous. It really wasn't the experience or level of service that I've come to expect of the Maman chain.",1
Really enjoyed my avocado toast. Nice flavors in the avocado and the eggs were cooked just right. Quick service. Glad we stopped.,0
"I had a pretty disappointing experience at FGCH today. The quinoa substitute didn't have much flavor and the portions were small. The chicken was good, but the mac and cheese was not good. The Brussels sprouts were also just okay. Overall, I don't think the price is worth the poor quality of the food.",1
"9/12/2020This is where we are having an early dinner. I thought we were at a different location. Whoops. Too many little bratty kids outside and screaming babies. :(. Not the restaurants fault!  More later. Food looks goodDinner L'Angolo in tribeca on the sidewalk. We started with baby octopus and it was tender and delicious! Had seafood gluten free fusilli pasta with mussels, shrimp and clams. It was fine and the marinara sauce was light so I asked for more. My daughter had grilled salmon medium rare which was good! Bf had veal Scallopini and a bottle of red wine. He sent the first bottle back. (Too acidic) then ordered a La Crema red which was $70. Overall 3.5 stars but I was so HAPPY to be in TriBeCa instead of Long Island that I'm making this a 4 star review!!",0
"I visited this restaurant about a month ago and I absolutely loved it. The malaxiangguo was perfect and the seating area was really cute and cozy. The only downside is that it can get a bit cramped inside, but it's definitely worth it!",1
"Northern Tiger is a mall food court food that is priced accordingly. The food is quick and tasty, and the drink selection is a step above generic. So enjoy it for what it is.",1
"Let me start out by saying I love the ambiance (5 stars). It's a beautiful, well-decorated restaurant with careful touches that make the place cozy,  inviting, and intimate. The service also deserves 5 stars. For an appetizer, I had a cheese empanada ($5). They have four other types of empanadas which I would love to try if I ever returned (beef, shrimp, spinach & ricotta, and heart of palm empanadas). There's a shareable appetizer for 3 empanadas for $15 as well.My friend had the yucca fries ($8) and they were delicious.For the entree, I got the stroganoff, $20, and added $7 for the filet mignon. It came with rice and very thin, crispy potato bites. Unfortunately, although my entree looked delicious, the flavor was overwhelmingly pungent with a Dijon mustard taste paired with quite a sweet undertone. Since I was very hungry, I did eat most of it but the strong and overwhelming mustard combined with the saccharine quality did not work for me, especially by the end of my meal. I think perhaps I just got the wrong entree! I would be willing to go again and get something else. If you like mustard or more sweet, creamy sauces you may love the stroganoff. Also, my friend whom I came with had the vegan stroganoff and she said she didn't have the issue with the strong Dijon mustard flavor. She said hers tasted like coconut milk and tomato and she loved it. So perhaps I would try the vegan stroganoff instead next time!",0
I went here under assumption that dim sum happy hour was in effect but it was just regular happy hour. The Chong Qing soup was spicy with decent flavor but not enough noodles.I didn't like the flavor of the shumai or soup dumplings but har gow was goodThe Kung fu scenes on the wall bothered me because as I'm Asian American I find those images more stereotypical and negative then empowering  or up liftingService was decent but definitely have had a lot betterRather go to tim ho wan or Han dynasty in this hood,0
"Standard American fare on Irving. Friend of A Farmer is a good spot for brunch if you're looking for something quieter that isn't on the bustle of Park Ave but still in the area. Their sweets (pancakes, toast, etc.) were much stronger on flavor than the savory dishes, which felt almost too basic. The portion sizes are pretty good, especially for Gramercy.It's a solid choice if you're looking for brunch and don't want to ball out on the Flatiron prices on the other side of Park Ave.",0
We ordered ribs for dinner last evening and I need to say the ribs had the most meat of any ribs I have had in years. The only problem was that you can request as many condiments as you want ( there are 4). I selected 3 but only received one. A minor dissapointment.We had enough ribs and beans for lunch the next day.Q: How come no cornbread like lother places?,0
"We were nearby the neighborhood and my son obviously always in the mood for ramen.  We looked up this place and they have one ramen dish and rest are Korean dishes.  Glad we stopped by this place.  The ramen $12 while a tad spicy is really not. It comes with a poached egg and braised pork belly.  My wife and I shared a pork belly with sautéed kimchi dish $17.  That came with 1 bowl of rice and the meat was very tasty and not too much fat.  They cut it thin enough but still looked plentiful.  We also split a small order of Korean drumsticks soy garlic flavor which came in 4 pieces $11. You can also do half half other flavors as well.  All in all, the bill before tip came out to around $44.   Very reasonable for the portion and straight up authentic.",0
"I really enjoy this restaurant! It's convenient and has a lot of seating. The sticky wings are my favorite dish - they're so good! The drinks are also great. One downside is that the bathrooms are not always the cleanest, but it's to be expected in New York City. Overall, I give this restaurant 4 stars for the great food and service.",1
"I've eaten a bunch of stuff from their menu, but I've settled right into just ordering the fried chicken sando or the chicken and mochi waffle.  They are so good.  Also, their tater tots are worth the upgrade.  They're normal tots, but the fry guy knows his stuff, so they're perfectly crispy.I highly recommend stopping in or getting some takeout.  Delicious.",0
"Food was wonderful, service was spot on but a little confused sometimes or she didn't understand what you're trying to say. But she was still a great waitress. Kept coming by to see if we need anything. I had the simple Meal spaghetti with clams and there was the clams in the spaghetti and they gave you me many little neck clams to dig out more clams. We had 4 bottles of wine that's why I'm writing this review so many days later so my head clear and I can remember how great of a meal and the company was. Unfortunately, the lady which is I think the hostess or the owner was annoying. We've already been seated or on our way to our seats and she asked if we had a reservation and we told her yes we were checked in. Then she came back and said you sure you have a reservation and we said yes and she came back with the book and said where are you here and then she finally let it go when she saw my fiancé's name. Very annoying. When she came with the book we were ready sitting down drinking wine and appetizer and she threw out our table. But otherwise, everyone else was wonderful and so is the food. She have might realized towards the end after",1
"Great Indian restaurant with cute ambience. The ambience is perfect to come with your girlfriends. We tried crispy okra salad, stuffed panner labadar, laccha parathas. The quantity and quality is great!! Loved the vibe and the location. Will come again? - yes",0
What's going to NY without getting pizza?! Decided to stop by for a quick bite and delighted to find out they have so many different options! I got the spinach dip pizza and it's was delicious. Had a nice cheese pull and great flavor. Crust was super thin and did I mention the size of slice is huge?! I went back a second time to try different options and by far my favorite was the spinach one!! The pizza options with white sauce are just amazing! The only pizza I didn't really care too much for the chicken parmigiana pizza. The chicken was coated and fried but too dry and underwhelming. But the mushroom and meatball were pretty satisfying. There's a $10 credit card minimum. This should be really easy because you shouldn't just be getting one slice. Two slices should get you to $10!,0
"I wish I knew how small this dish was before I got it for lunch. I was still not full after this, and really not a fan of how it tasted :/",0
"If they're going to charge pho for a more expensive price, they should at least make it taste better than the other cheaper options around them. On the inside, the place is really modern and spacious. I loved the wood and green accents. The food came really fast, I'll give them that. But that 8 hour broth was just mediocre and was more on the waterier side. Compared to other pho in the area, the noodles here are harder and have a more solid texture, which I wasn't a fan of. It had a more undercooked taste to it. The beef was also way too dry. I'd skip the fancy interior and just go to my usual Chinatown pho places for cheaper, more flavorful options.",1
"Hands down this place is an easy 5 stars. The vibe is welcoming and fun, and I was just picking up! The food is fabulous and well wrapped to keep the food warm on the walk home. The chicken nachos were fresh and well spiced with an ample amount of toppings. No chance of running out. The grilled jalapeño were very hot but eaten in small bites were the perfect compliment to the salty chips. I didn't even get to the burrito as the elote (corn on the cob) and esquites (corn off the cob in a cup) and nachos were just enough. My daughter loved her burrito: seasoned perfectly, nice balance of elements in it, and although as a non-burrito person found the tortilla a bit thick (She'd love a burrito bowl option) that didn't limit her enjoyment. I'm excited to have my burrito for lunch tomorrow.",0
"Brunch at the bar was decent, but the Bloody Mary was terrible. The avocado toast and eggs were much better, though the portions were small. The tacos were tiny, and my friend had to get another entree. Overall, the food was good but the prices are a bit high.",1
"Tiny old-school Italian restaurant that delivers amazing pasta! Going for a birthday is a HUGE DEAL there, and I love it! They turn on some loud birthday music and blinking lights as they bang on pots and pans. Everyone around you is clapping and laughing along. There's no experience like it, but just trust me and GO and see for yourself!  All the pasta dishes are soooooooo good! They're served in pans, which is pretty cool. The only downside is that the pans are made of metal, which means that the pasta cools down pretty quickly during your meal.",0
"The restaurant has a cute old-school vibe and the service was attentive. Our mason jars were filled with water and they even provided chopsticks. The better choices were the Dan Dan Noodle (which had a flatter chewy noodle, which is more Shanghainese than Sichuan) and the Pan Fried Pork Dumplings. The beef scallion pancake had the right components: crispy outside, crunchy inside, with sweet sesame sauce. The bok choy was fresh. I wouldn't recommend the shrimp dumplings, the skin was a bit rough and the filling was not flavorful. The diced chicken was tender, but it wasn't quite tasty like a typical kungpao chicken. Our bill came to $36 per person, which wasn't bad considering how much we ordered.",1
"Los Mariscos is a great place to go for lunch! The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I would definitely recommend dining in, as the menu is a bit limited in addition to the seating.",1
"The Beef Birria Taco was a bit bland, but the Brooklyn Taco was good. The corned beef was a bit too salty and tough, but I would definitely give it another shot.",1
I was really disappointed with my meal at Meatpacking. The food was mediocre at best and the service was terrible. The atmosphere was nice though. I don't think it's worth the price tag.,1
"Prince Street Pizza makes a fantastic Spicy Spring Square--that pepperoni is full of flavor, super cheesy, and i loved how thick and perfectly cooked it was. The hype is real. The line of people waiting should not deter you from staying. They move quickly and efficiently. They take cash or credit. There is no seating available but there is a little room to stand and eat for those that do not want to eat outside. I got lucky and found some counter space.  My friend and I split the margarita slice, which was good, but I was still on cloud 9 with that Spicy spring pie. I'm not even a big pepperoni person but this was great stuff! It was worth waiting and I can't wait to return to do it again!",1
"I'm over the moon at the fact this place exists! Ever since I moved to the east coast I've had trouble finding quality fried pickles! But Diller is now my new go-to for whenever I have a craving. And they have gluten free and vegan options. This is only about a 5 min walk from the Grand St. train station, and the pickle guys are right next door. They have some seating outside too.

I tried the regular fried pickles with the Diller sauce and Siracha Aioli sauce. The Diller sauce was good, it was creamy and reminded me of yogurt or laban cucumber sauce (IYKYK). The Siracha aioli sauce was tangy and had a little spice to it; this one is similar (imo) to the typical sauce you usually get with fried pickles. I preferred the Siracha Aioli, but I like that they have many different sauce options, because I love sauce!

I think it's really important for me to add that the cashier was soooo friendly, he went over the menu and he gave me some background on the business. He explained to me that they had just hired a new pickle dipper (my words",1
"I visited this restaurant for lunch today and I really enjoyed the cute ambiance! The tables are close together, but it didn't bother me too much. The food was really good, and a great price for what you're getting. I got tacos and they were really tasty. I think this place is really popular during happy hour or dinner rush, because it was pretty busy when I was there. Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant and I would definitely recommend it!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The spicy seafood stew was so good and perfectly spiced for a cold night. Pretty pricey but nyc ktown is quite expensive for korean food in general compared to other cities. They only accept cash or Amex which I thought was really random. They serve cold barley/corn tea instead of water which I really enjoyed and was refreshing. Covid is a fun restaurant at night with the music and ""indoor outdoor"" seating for Covid.",1
"Got a few bowls (falafel bowl and butternut squash bowl) to go for dinner one night. Cashier was friendly and it didn't take too long to get the food. Food was pretty tasty, if not terribly exciting. Prices were fair. Good healthy option for the area! 3.5 stars.",0
"I had a great dining experience at Cafe Centro. The special I ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. The dining area is quiet and easy to hold a conversation, which is great for a romantic dinner. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"Came here the other night with my Fiancé and her family because of the yelp reviews. I have to say, this place was a great find. Nicely decorated interior. Place was packed. Nice vibe. Very loud. Pretty small interior with small tables. So be sure to make a reservation. Service was great. The waitress was very attentive and it being so small, anything we needed they were very fast to accommodate. We are a demanding bunch, so thanks for putting up with us.We ordered the entire menu it seemed liked:Meatballs - Fire!Fried Mestballs - Great!Fried Calamari - Great!Octopus - Fire!Meat and Cheese (Prosciutto, speck, burrata, Buffalo mozzarella ) - Amazing. So much meat!Margherita Pizza - Fire!The Pizza San Daniele - Fire!Black squid ink pasta - Pass, it just was mehPappardelle with ragú - Great!Cannelloni al forno - The best dish on the menu!!Chocolate pudding - passFried pastry - awful - passGelato - passOverall - a very good place. I love the tapas style. This place is a great spot!",0
"I was so disappointed with my meal from Uber Eats. I ordered two hot dogs and fries, and the fries were greasy and mushy. The hot dogs were also below average - the bread had a strange smell and there was barely any meat on them. Overall, a terrible experience. I would not recommend this service to anyone.",1
"The restaurant was nice and the food was good. I especially liked the vegetarian ramen. However, I didn't like how the staff was hovering over us while we were eating. It would have been nice to just say hey we are closing at 4 in the beginning of our meal instead of hovering over us. The shot of sake was also strong, which I liked.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The pizza was delicious and the crust was really good. The only downside was that they did the trash right in front of me, which was a bit of a letdown.",1
"I had a great time at Coco Pazzo. The trendy restaurant was located on a quiet corner in SoHo with lots of sunlight streaming in from their floor-to-ceiling windows. My friend and I were seated at a small table with prime views of the rest of the dining room. We ordered some drinks and started to catch up on the recent events in our lives. My friend found her Negroni too herbaceous and medicinal, but my Aperol Spritz was perfectly balanced with light notes of sweetness and citrus. In terms of the food, we decided to share a few items, starting with the CocoSette, a hearty salad of farro, lentils, chickpeas, mushrooms, zucchini, cauliflower, and cannellini beans, which was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the Octopus appetizer, which included charred tentacles served with a Mediterranean blend of anchovies, olives, crushed potatoes, and basil. The octopus was tender and successfully absorbed the briny flavor from the olives. Lastly, we shared one of the daily special main courses - a Black Bass filet that was steamed in a bag. The fish was cooked with carrots, celery, zucchini, lemon, and a",1
"Casa del Toro is a delicious Mexican restaurant that got our taste buds going in the right direction. The eclectic styling is fun and the perfect spot to catch a show while you eat. The cocktails are delicious and just the right size, and the chips with guac were a great way to start the meal. We recommend trying the short rib tacos - they're our favorite! Save room for dessert, as the flan is delicious. We'll be back for another meal soon!",1
"Overall, I thought the food was mediocre. The portions are small for the price, and the quality of the food does not justify the price. The waitstaff was inconsiderate, talking over our food and spitting saliva all over us. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Barn Joo has been a great stop for a delicious bite during Happy Hour, which also happens on the weekends I believe. Their food is great and their cocktails are both interesting and satisfying. Their potato croquettes really hit the spot every time - I would go out of my way to come here for this app alone! Their wings are of course pretty solid the service has been fairly quick and friendly.I need to stop by for a proper dinner, but I've been pretty happy just stopping after getting some chores done in Union Square. Recommend!",0
"Ba'al is the perfect spot for a quick work day lunch. I always get the three sides combo, with beets and carrots, falafel and one more side based on my mood of the day, fried eggplant, hummus, couscous, cauliflower or whatever, and so far everything I've tried were simply great. When my coworkers and I came at 12, the line was out of the door, so now we always come at 1pm and can get out food right away.

The only downside is that the restaurant can get quite crowded, so it's not the best place to come for a romantic dinner. But overall, I'm very pleased with Ba'al and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, convenient meal.",1
"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch today and was really impressed. The fish was very fresh and they also sell fish, including uni (a box for around $75 I think). The price was pretty good too. I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"Just finished dinner here feeling pretty full. Place was filling up with seats quick and got seated immediately. Service was average here. Ended up ordering some traditional dishes and some bossam which is one of my favorite dishes. This particular order came with pretty much the entire fatty part or the pork which isnt typical. The food is a very unique style but dishes were just average. The price is decent for depending on how many people. Ive definitely had better traditional korean food. The pictures looked way better than how the dishes were delivered. One time try and probably will try my luck elsewhere. Overall pretty average place, nothing really special about this spot tbh. You get what you pay for here.",0
"Saigon Social delivered on flavor though execution was a bit off during my visit. The Spicy Chicken Sandwich had all the banh mi fixings with heat brought in by the cayenne and pickled jalapeños. It had great flavor but the chicken was just too salty. Perhaps the chicken is both brined and seasoned before being battered (with more seasoning) and fried. In any case, I would have it again if the salt factor was tamed.



The Lemongrass Pork itself was delicious. However, the rice was undercooked with bits of mushy rice and hard grains. Even so, I'll be giving them a second shot to try other items on the menu. Fingers crossed.",1
"This restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for quality Japanese food that's open until 3AM. The atmosphere is really nice and intimate, and the service was great. I definitely recommend trying out the pork yakiniku and chicken nanban dishes - they're both really delicious.",1
"My sister took me to Boqueria & treated me to the delicious tapas here. We chose to dine indoors (had to show vaccination card). I felt safe eating indoors to be honest, as the outdoor dining tables appeared too close to each other. Our waitress Wendy was superb - super friendly, attentive & nice. She gave us great recommendations. We ordered a bunch of things to share: glass of pineapple sangria, glass of red sangria, maiz rustido, patatas bravas, small seafood paella, gambas al ajillo, dulce de leche churros.I liked the pineapple sangria more than the red sangria. Yes, it was a bit stronger than the red sangria but still delicious. My most favorite tapas included the maiz rustido (corn w/ manchego cheese), gambas al ajillo (shrimp w/ garlic and oil), dulce de leche churros. I love corn & the maiz rustido tapa was so fresh, delicious and cheesy. The shrimp w/ garlic and oil was superb - the shrimp was al dente and well marinated w/ the garlic and oil & I enjoyed dipping the bread into the garlic + oil concoction. You can ask your waiter/waitress for extra bread. I love desserts and this dulce de leche churros was out of this world. It was crunchy, savory & the dulce de leche filling was so delicious! I highly recommend these 3 items.I liked the patatas bravas, but would preferred it if they also added some meat or scallion to it & the potatoes were a big cut on the larger size. The small seafood paella was enjoyable and loved all the fresh well seasoned seafoods on it. I was not a big fan of the bomba rice, and would prefer the other type of rice for paella. Overall, this place is a great spot to get tapas + sangrias/alcohol. Very relaxed/chill environment. I also liked that you can pay on your own phone at the end, which was very convenient and fast.",0
Stopped in for some clean eats. Ordered chicken quesadilla with corn and black beans and jalapeño inside. I ordered spicy salsa to dip it into and it was delicious. Good for a quick bite,0
"I made reservations through Yelp! The restaurant looks small and incredibly packed at the front, but they have very nice, more spacious, separated small cubicles in the back for 3-4 people each. I was placed in one of those cubicles, which was really comfortable place to hang. They have plugs, wifi, hand sanitizer, and a bell to call the waiter/waitress in each cubicle.I'm not a huge fan of ramen but the sole reason I was so excited to come to this place is for the Omurice. It did not disappoint! They will show you how jiggly the omelet is before cutting it open and pouring over the demi-glace sauce (you can also opt for curry, but I personally prefer demi-glace). The egg is incredibly fluffy, the fried rice is super tasty (fluffy, not dry or oily), the sauce tastes delicious--savory, with a little bit of sweetness that keeps you coming back for more. I thought I was not that hungry when I got there but after that first bite, I just seamlessly finished the whole plate. I just go one spoon after another. The omurice comes with a drink (lemonade or Thai iced tea). I opted for the lemonade, which was obviously sweet, but not overwhelming and they add cucumber which gave a nice refreshing aftertaste.My friend ordered the ramen though and they said it's really good. For indecisive people, they have a split bowl option where you can have 2 types of ramen at once (it's visually appealing too). As for the price, I think it's reasonable as well. The service was pretty good.",0
"What was one of my best kept secrets appears to be now one of the popular rooftop bars to attend in this area. Also from reading my old review, don't know why I would think they serve food. Well technically they serve small bites, but no one is coming here to order food.Seems like people are constantly calling to book a reservation for private events or for reserved seats so it is a bummer to see sections closed off or being chased away by the 'promoters' that the space is reserved. And then the guests end up abandoning the space anyways. Amateurs.One thing that I found quite annoying is the priority the bartender takes drink orders. I noticed that there is a woman that walks around taking orders on an iPad. Those drinks are made first before the bartender will take orders from people that are standing at the bar. You could be standing at the bar for a good half hour before they notice that you're standing there for a while and finally take your drink order. This is something they need to fix. Or maybe they don't care enough, who knows.",0
"I had a great time at the Brooklyn Chop House! The staff is very friendly and the food was great. I especially enjoyed the dumplings and the gyro dumplings. The only downside was that the steak I ordered was overcooked, but I understand that it can be difficult to cook a steak perfectly. The prices are a bit high, but overall it was a great experience.",1
"Los Tacos No 1 is a small restaurant with limited seating, but the tacos are worth it. The guacamole and salsa are both excellent, and the pollo asado on a corn tortilla is my favorite. The only downside is that it's a bit cramped, so be prepared to be elbow-to-elbow with your fellow taco fans.",1
"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. The space is beautiful and the Genesis showroom on the first floor is amazing, but the tea room service was slow and lackadaisical. The atmosphere was nice, but I'm not sure it was worth the price tag.",1
"Went here at 4pm on a ThursdayI wanted to see why there's so many and such high reviews for this place. Also I wanted to satisfy my tonkotsu craving from two days ago. When I arrived it was empty and one of the employees was eating herself. I was pretty set on getting the tonkotsu broth but had to decide between shio, shoyu, and miso. I don't really remember why I ended up choosing shio, but I personally am not the biggest fan of miso. I think I didn't choose shoyu because I wanted a less complicated broth. The ramen came out in practically five minutes. Sitting at the bar table I kinda saw inside the kitchen but under the curtains all I saw was a pair of legs moving around. I like how there's a huge bunch of scallions. It went really well with the charsiu. I like the addition of the wood ear because it added a crunchy and chewy texture. The thin cuts of both the scallion and wood ear does show the effort of the kitchen. The noodles themselves were very good, thin and chewy. The black garlic oil wasn't overpowering as I ate but it definitely left me with some stinky breath, which was both satisfying and annoying. The whole bowl was everything that can be expected from a bowl of tonkotsu ramen. Like do you know the feeling of appreciating something but not liking it? It didn't make it to the ranks of something I'd crave...So not 5*I was in and out within thirty minutes. I appreciate how Japanese eateries make me feel comfortable doing this alone.",0
"As America's First Pizzeria, I would've expected more, but unfortunately this was a less than satisfying experience. The ordering process was efficient and the staff went out of their way to confirm a question I asked. My wife and I ordered the Original Margherita pizza and were less than impressed. This pizza was seemingly devoid of flavor in the sauce, crust and there was next to no cheese on the pizza. We had eagerly waited all week to order a pizza to start our weekend with a special treat, however this was no treat at all. In fact, we were left non-satiated. The pizza is aesthetically appeasing, but at least in the case of this particular experience, there was an inherent lack of flavor and texture and was an underwhelming experience.",0
"The live jazz was a nice touch, but the food was not worth the price. I ended up getting food poisoning and was vomiting until the wee hours of the morning. Do not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I thought the pho was okay. I ordered the superbowl pho and steak and brisket pho. Personally, I thought there was too much meat in both and not enough noodles. I would probably opt for the vegan pho option next time. The noodles were also pretty chewy. The spring rolls, thai iced tea, and lychee soda were pretty good. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant, and service was great!",1
"When I first came here, I rated them 5 stars because everything was so delicious my first time. I went again yesterday and was quite disappointed. We started off with fried dumplings, something we got our first time and love. However, this time, it seemed that they were left in the fryer for too long as they were too overdone for my liking. We got beef chow fun again which was the best part of the meal. $8.75 for a nice portion of beef chow fun that is oh so delicious! It's flavorful and the noodles are the perfect texture. I'd definitely order it again. We decided to try the sesame chicken for the first time and we were super disappointed. It was $13.50 and it didn't seem like a very good portion of chicken for that price. Not to mention, it also tasted very overdone and like it was left in the fryer for too long. The chicken was tough and I would never order it again. The only thing I'd seriously come back for is the beef chow fun.",0
"I had a great time at Upland yesterday! The open bar was perfect for our company event, and the food was even better. I especially loved the cod ball starter, and the steak in the main course could have been cooked a bit more evenly, but overall it was a great meal. The desserts were a bit lackluster, but overall I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"How delightful it is for Midtowners to have a destination spot for lunch and early dinner near the workplace again! Midtown East near the Grand Central neighborhood has taken a beating since COVID ran wild in NYC. As a number of eateries have closed its doors with most office workers doing WFH, the addition of a good vegan option is such much needed and welcomed presence.  The food is fresh and delicious, and the venue is nice and clean for those who enjoy dining in. Personal favourites include the Botanical Salad and Spicy Chili Sin Carne.  As a matter of fact, you can get any bowl or salad and add the superseed avocado to hit the spot.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was authentically delicious and the service was great. I loved their boneless wings - they were really tasty and had a great spicy sauce. The rice came with a side salad, which was a really nice touch. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!",1
"Are the people who rave about ROKC the same ones who live uptown and therefore don't have access to the plethora of much more awesome ramen downtown? Because I took an especial trip to come here and I don't get what the fuss is about. I had the Okinawa ramen, and the broth was bland, the lone piece of chicken flabby and meager and the toppings sparse (half an egg, a piece of chicken, and scallions chopped so coarsely that every bite was a big peppery hit). Worst of all, the noodles were so disappointing - I understand that very few ramen restaurants make their own noodles, but what I got was thick, and not in a chewy/springy way, but in a soggy and overcooked way.The cocktails are slightly better. I went out on a limb and tried the Hijiki, which has seaweed in it. It was served in a soup bowl, which was unique. but honestly I just couldn't have very much of it since it was so strongly seaweedy and savory. It's like a novelty drink that's such a novel and intellectual concept but I had no interest in taking more than a few sips. The grapefruit drink was a little better, or perhaps simply more mainstream, and I enjoyed the accompanying smoking incense stick for atmosphere.The oysters were in my opinion, fresh but nondescript, but for $1.50 during happy hour, sure.This place runs a tight ship. I arrived a little before 7 pm on a Thursday evening, and we very luckily obtained the last pair of seats. Anyway. Don't waste your time commuting here for the ramen (it's not that great) or the atmosphere (it's way too busy and they're just shoveling people in and out). BUT if you're in the neighborhood, sure, why not drop by because there's no other Japanese/cocktail/oyster place in the vicinity?",0
"I came here to take out gluten free pizza after my chiropractor appt who is in the neighborhood. Wild has been on my go to list for years and I especially was interested because I need to stay away from starches and gluten food for health reasons. I don't think the pizza was chewy but i definitely needed to spice it up more. It was slightly bland. I just got the regular pizza before i started deviating away to the different varieties. I am not opposed to trying again, if necessary and next time  I am in the west village. 

I usually almost always in the West Village so I will keep in mind if I want to do a do over.",1
"The Cafeteria is a great place to go for a quick meal, but it can be quite difficult to get a seat. The waiters are very friendly and the food is always delicious. However, the manager can be quite unhelpful, and the wait times can be quite long.",1
"I was really excited to try Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles, as I love pan fried noodles. I was not disappointed. The shrimp and vegetable pan fried dumplings were amazing, but the star of the show was the hand pulled noodles. They were really delicious and very mild - even under-seasoned. I would definitely recommend ordering them as part of a soup or in pan fried dish. A portion could easily be shared.",1
"Dame is a top-notch restaurant with a long wait time. However, the restaurant's amazing food more than makes up for it. I highly recommend visiting Dame if you're in the Village.",1
"I don't get all the subpar and bad reviews for this diner. Yelpers need to take a chill pill. It's a diner. It's not meant to be a Michelin Star rated joint. It's basic diner food. Typical huge menu. Standard pricing in my eyes.Food came out quick and hot. Servers constantly had our group's coffee cups and water glasses filled. Even though it was packed they did their best to accompany our group of HANGRY runners who had just completed the NYRR Manhattan 7 Mile race. After a short wait for others to leave they put two tables together and took our orders. We were all satisfied with our tasty breakfasts. They did not rush us out either, and asked if we wanted more coffee after we finished our meals. Therefore, I'm giving 4 stars to offset all the stupid one and two star reviews!",0
"Zai Lai is a great vendor to work with! The food is flavorful and authentic, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend their eggplant veggie bowl, which is a great option for vegetarians.",1
"Eataly Flatiron is a sprawling maze, almost designed for you to get lost in. I've found myself circling and circling their cheese aisles, seemingly endless food stands, and shelves and shelves of pasta and olive oil. Any imported artisanal Italian food products can be found here, often for a pretty penny. To have it all in one place makes it feel like an amusement park, particularly when you account for all the tourists that it draws. Though it's described as a tourist trap, I think the food is quite delicious. I really like the gelato counter near the front, as well as the pizza counter, where I've enjoyed some solid slices. The rooftop bar and restaurant transforms with each season and they do a good job with the decorations. It's a great place to feel festive during the holidays, or find yourself surrounded by flowers come spring. Whenever I'm looking for fresh seafood, handmade pasta, tinned seafood, and specialty jams, I'm inclined to pay Eataly a visit. I may come away spending much more than I intended, but there's no other place like it in the city.",0
"I always enjoy a meal at Ruth Chris, but this time I was disappointed. We had a reservation for 6:45pm and were expecting to enjoy our lobster, but they ran out. I chose something else, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Nevertheless, we had a good time celebrating our friends' birthday.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Yama Ramen. The chirashi was fresh and the fish was cooked perfectly. The rice was also seasoned perfectly, and the service was excellent. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick and easy meal.",1
"I had a really positive experience at Pado. The sushi was fresh and delicious, and the service was great in a rather cozy, intimate space. I especially loved the hand rolls - they all tasted great and I especially loved the tri-state roll. That being said, I thought the bang bang shrimp and love roll were a bit too heavy handed with the sauce and masked the flavor of the fish a bit. But overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Pado.",1
"I had a wonderful time at Cho Dang Gol! The food was absolutely amazing and the service was top-notch. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious Korean food. The side dishes are especially delicious, and I was really full after eating them all. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes!",1
"I absolutely loved this little spot! The beef lemongrass banh mi was delicious and huge, and the chips were a great added touch. The only downside was that it was cash only, but they did have an ATM machine inside. The atmosphere was very cozy and the staff were super friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"I had a great time at Redemption NYC. The outdoor seating was great, and the glass doors that open for you to watch the games playing inside from the outside were a nice touch. The food was delicious, and the staff were very accommodating. They were willing to change the channel for me if there was something particular I was hoping to watch. Overall, a great experience.",1
"Overall, I had a good time at the restaurant. The speakeasy entrance might be too much for some, but I like it because I'm into that kind of thing. The marqueed entrance makes it easy to find. The dining room can be quite loud and dark, but it's a fun atmosphere to share dishes tapas-style. The grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings were a favorite of my friends, but I much prefer the bulgogi ribeye tacos. The women's restroom is an experience on its own - I can appreciate a restaurant's beautiful restroom too.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and was impressed with the variety of asian cuisine on offer. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I especially enjoyed the maki rolls and the Pad Thai. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit small, and it was a bit cramped. But overall, I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good Asian meal.",1
"We came here on a Sunday, and the restaurant had no wait. We heard this was great pizza and decided to give it a try before our show. Unfortunately, our waiter neglected to tell us it would take 45 mins to get a pizza. I had to approach him four times and at least two of those times he was on his iPhone and completely ignoring customers. After some heckling, we got our food with 10 minutes to spare. So we had to rush our eating. I give the food five stars, but I gave the service about 2.5 stars. Because the food was really good, I decided to go more generous on the rating. Order the large pizza with toppings. It is one of the best pizza's in town. You won't go wrong on the food, but be sure to leave yourself at least 1.5 hours to order and eat. Bon appetit!",1
"Good Enough to Eat is well known for its brunch; however, I wanted to take a moment to appreciate it for their dinner. The menu has many tempting (and tasty) options to fit most of your cravings. I've enjoyed their turkey dinner, risotto, mac and cheese, and pasta riggies. They also offer a separate BBQ menu if you're interested in delicious ribs! (you have to special request the BBQ menu)",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The food was decent, though I was expecting it to be a bit better. The standout dish of the night was the chilled cucumber soup - it was refreshing, light, and perfect for summertime. The bolognese was also very good, though the portion size was a bit small. The service was great, though the cioppino was a bit of a letdown. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a casual night out.",1
"I came to Charlie Bird for a friends birthday so we managed to order a bunch of apps to share. The one outstanding dish for me was the farro salad with bits of pistachio. Overall the food was good but not memorable. Most of us got pasta as a main and I wish I had gotten a protein of sort instead. My favorite of the 3 pastas we ordered is the triangoli. That said, service is very friendly and would still come again if In the area. I reckon the outdoor seating will be very popular in the summer given how nicely decorated and instagrammable it looks!

Overall, I had a good time at Charlie Bird. The food was good, but not memorable. I would come back if I was in the area, but I would also consider trying something different on my next visit. The outdoor seating is really nice and I'm sure it will be very popular in the summer.",1
"The food here is great, and the curry goat is my favorite dish. The only downside is that it can take a long time to get your order completed, but overall I've had good experiences here. The prices are reasonable, and I love that the restaurant is open 24 hours.",1
"I've tried Lolos on two different occasions and both experiences were completely different. The first time I went there I ordered a warm bowl with dirty rice, shrimp and broccoli and I was not impressed. The dirty rice was  overcooked and lacked seasoning in my opinion. The shrimp and the broccoli were decent at best but featured a ton of curry flavoring that really wasnt expected. The second time I had Lolos was at work when they donated meals to hospital staff in the ICU. We received a large piece of jerk chicken and fried rice and it was delicious! The jerk chicken was cooked to perfection! It was juicy, tender and paired perfectly with the rice. That meal renewed my hope in Lolo's. Definitely worth giving it a shot!",1
"I decided to try the impossible burger today after hearing about it, and this was the only place nearby that had it. I have to say, this was probably one of the dryest burgers I've ever had in my life. I'm not sure if it's due to the patty or due to Umami's cooking of it, but this burger was not juicy and the cheese was barely melted. At $13 a burger, Not gonna bother again.",1
"I haven't been to Mercury Bar East or West in a minute. But I was genuinely surprised on how decent everything somewhat was. The east side location is actually a detroit lions/msu spartans sports bar. Shoutout for that. Came in here looking for happy hour with a friend before a movie and cheap eats. Pretty decent deal with $5 beers, $6 wines, and $7 martinis/margaritas until 8pm. I love me some 8 o'clock extended happy hours. I was not impressed with any of the beers they had on tap and I'm pretty sure Bud and Coors were like the happy hour options so I decided to be adventurous and go with a cosmopolitan. This is something I would probably never order. I'm not Carrie Bradshaw. Vomit. It tasted like rubbing alcohol with a splash of cran. Kind of what I expected. What separates this from being a 3 - star review I'd honestly say I was floored by how good our food was. I mean it was still garbage bar food but tasted really great. We got the loaded tots smothered with mac and cheese. Trust me in that this is really amazing. It sounds weird as hell but the mac and cheese was better than average and I think there was truffle oil in it? It was jazzy, a huge portion, and affordable. We also split an order of their spinach artichoke dip which was also just as flavorful and cheesy and so many cheese pulls but I didn't take any photos of the cheese dripping everywhere because we were cold and starving. It's still a crap dive as its always been. But whoever has taken over their kitchen now - two solid thumbs up.",0
"Came here for lunch and they don't take reservations. My coworker and I came at around noon for his birthday and luckily had 2 available seats left. The server gave us the menu and we placed our orders in less than 5 minutes later. All orders are placed on their ipads and goes straight to the chefs. I opted for the lunch rolls and ordered a few a la carte hand rolls after while my co worker ordered strictly a la carte items. Rolls came out quick but we devoured them even quicker. I would say we sat down and finished everything under an hour. The best roll was the scallop roll, we both ordered an extra roll to top off the meal. The less impressive roll was the vegetarian roll. It felt like a salad with rice and seaweed. I would say skip the vegetarian roll if possible but it was part of the lunch special. All in all it was a great meal and was roughly $120 after tip and tax. Come here early if you can to avoid having to wait for a seat.",0
"I really enjoyed my time at Blue Willow. The atmosphere was really cool and reminded me of an old Chinese drama. The food was delicious and I was really satisfied with my meal. The only downside was that it took a while for our drinks to come, but that's to be expected in a busy restaurant like this. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely come back!",1
"Carmine's is a great place to go with family or friends. The portions are heaping and the pasta dishes are very similar to Maggiano's, which I love. However, the pasta dishes can be hit or miss. The eggplant Parmesan is not my favorite, but my husband really enjoyed it. The Rigatoni and Broccoli with Chicken was my favorite dish. The Salmon was also really good. The only downside is that there is no family bathroom, which can be frustrating. The bathrooms are really outdated and there is not much space for strollers or wheelchairs. Overall, Carmine's is a great Italian restaurant.",1
"I was really impressed with Sugar Hill! The eggs benedict was delicious and well-crafted. The flavor was delicate, the eggs perfectly poached, and a sturdy, slightly toasted muffin underneath, complemented the meal perfectly. I also really enjoyed the cappuccinos - they were great! I would definitely recommend Sugar Hill to anyone looking for a more subtle, healthier breakfast option.",1
Was really craving ramen the other day so I decided to stop in. I was quite intrigued by the whip cream (made with potatoes) that could be ordered on top of the ramen. The ramen was pretty average tasting and quite expensive so I doubt I'll come back. I was a bit upset by how small the portion of pork in my meal was.,0
"They have really nice poke bowls to go. It's all build your own. You can get zucchini noodles, white or brown rice as a base. Protein and veggies. Everything is quite fresh and the sauces are really nice! I recommend this place for a quick lunch.",0
"Fried chicken wings for the win! Crispy on the outside and juicy tender on the inside.The calamari was okay, but less crispy. The Chicken Kuro ramen lacked flavor despite having black garlic oil. The chicken in it was fine but also not that tasty.A fine bowl of ramen for the UWS, but there are better options in NYC!",0
"I was very shocked with my experience here, and not in a good way. When I lived in New York, I would come here all the time, but it looks like they renovated it and ruined a lot of it. First of all, it is much smaller now than it was when I used to go. The kitchen takes up more space and they have a weird wall dividing the restaurant in half. As soon as we walked in, rather than greeting us nicely, the hostess said ""we can seat you but anything you order will take 50 minutes to come."" I'm sorry, what??? We had time to kill so we ended up staying. But we were already pretty turned off by how rude the staff was. They told us that even green tea would take long to come, which I feel is ridiculous. The  place is so mismanaged and Uber eats holds up a ton of orders now. You'll see this when you walk in how many Uber eats employees you see walking in and out (if you dare to try this place despite our bad experience). I got the same thing I always do - the hippie ramen - and it came about 35 minutes after we were seated. I started eating but by the time I finished (10-15 minutes later), my friends' food STILL didn't come! Also, my noodles were  pretty hard so I honestly wish they just took more time with it.We finally asked the same rude waitress what the holdup was. She checked on our food and we had to beg her to give us tea and fried rice on the house to make up for the poor service. Even this was exhausted and should have just been offered to us in the first place! The fried rice was delicious, though, and my friends both loved their red ramen. I definitely wouldn't come here again though, since I've never experienced such bad and standoffish service.",0
"Takeout review:Easy and simple to order, good selection of items with a core set of ingredients. The take out packaging was beautiful and held the food in place, keeping it neat and tidy. The bentos was simple, yet creative and had a nice toned down flavor. I usually don't get full from eating sushi but since the ratio of rice to fish leaned heavy on the carbs, it was a filling meal. Overall tasty and unique, but for me personally, I'd like a better ratio of rice and fish, but can't really complain as the price was reasonable.",0
"I had a disappointing experience at this Thai restaurant. The food was bland and boring, there was no spicyness whatsoever in any of my dishes and not much flavor. The staff was friendly, but the food was not there. It was very generic tasting. There was not alot of seating there either, which was annoying. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll bother coming back. For papaya salad, tom yum soup, rice noodles and thai ice tea it came out to be $23.",1
"Joe's is a decent pizza place, but it's not the best I've tried. The crust is the best part of the slice, but the pepperoni is a bit thick for my liking and the cheese ratio is OK. Overall, a really solid slice, but a bit pricey.",1
"Although the Food Network seems to be AFATT (All Flay All the Time) these days, one Bobby Flay show I especially enjoyed was one where he goes on foodie crawls around New York with his daughter Sophie. Not only is it interesting to see him interact with Sophie, but it's also cool to see them explore the city the exact same way I do. 

One of the things they did in one episode was explore Chelsea Market. Of all the food stands there, Los Tacos #1 came highly recommended from Bobby as one of the best taquerias in New York. Even from someone like Bobby Flay, I'll take this with a grain of salt. Not only are there are plenty of hidden gems to discover, in both Manhattan and the outer boroughs, but, as a Californian, I've got access to either the real thing or to cutting-edge variations of it, whether in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, or San Diego (which, in normal times, offers an easy walk into Mexico itself and the vibrant food scene in Tijuana).

Still, the tacos here didn't disappoint. Even if they're a bit spendy (and that's already by inflated Bay Area standards), at least you",1
"If a pizza place has been in business for over 100 years, they must know what they're doing. 
The basic margherita was simple, with thin crust and light cheese that was savory without being overbearing in flavor. 
Italian sodas and spritzers were perfect on a super hot day. 
The interior walls have exposed brick, ceilings with pressed tin or plaster, making this one charming eatery. 
Cash only.",1
"So, this is Reese Witherspoon's restaurant?  It's got a southern charm to it. I really like this place. The biscuits were heavenly. The Mac and cheese was ok- but the best thing about them? Believe it or not it's the lemonade.",0
"Boqueria is a tapas restaurant that I fell in love with during my recent visit to Madrid. The restaurant is small and cozy, with a vibe that is really comfortable and inviting. The happy hour menu is perfect for someone who wants to try a few dishes without spending a lot of money. I ordered a few items off the regular menu and was really impressed with the quality and flavor of everything I tasted. The albondigas (meatballs) were a bit tough at first, but they were incredibly tender and flavorful after being cooked in the lamb's milk cheese sauce. The fried squid (fritura mixta) was also excellent, with a slightly spicy marinara sauce that was delicious. The bacon-wrapped dates were a bit disappointing, though. They were stuffed with almonds and blue cheese, but I didn't taste much cheese in the dish. The dates were also a bit dry, which made them a bit tough to eat. Despite those minor complaints, I would definitely recommend Boqueria to anyone looking for a delicious Spanish tapas restaurant.",1
"I had a wonderful experience at Ichiran in Japan and I was excited to try the restaurant here in the US. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived around 7pm, but we were able to get a table after about 10 minutes. The set up of Ichiran is really nice, allowing you to focus on the food. I was surprised to find that the ramen already came with chasu, so I ordered the $5 topping combo with an egg, extra chasu, wood ear, and green onions. The service was extremely efficient and I loved how they served it to me through the curtains. The ramen was delicious and I can't wait to come back!",1
"This is NYC eating at its best.  I stopped here 3 times in 2 weeks; brunch and two dinners (one at the bar, one outside).  The bar is spectacular: well crafted cocktails both house and your favorite classic.  The Brussels, octopus, fries, tartars, poké, salads, you name it, was delicious.  Wide array of veggie options!Perfect for solo or with friends you can't miss!!!",0
I had a great time at K Rico South American Steakhouse! The food was amazing and the service was great. I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to others.,1
We had a great time at crispo. The food and service are amazing here. Their wine selection is also very good. We had the bone marrow for appetizer which came with escargots on top. We then had pastas as second dishes. One was their famous cabonara and the other one was black truffle ravioli. Definitely one of the best pastas in nyc. We then shared the steaks and branzino. Everything was just super delicious!! The decor inside is very cool as well. It has a glass roof inside and the starting feels like you're eating in a garden at night. Highly recommend this place!!,0
"To be honest, I don't think it has the best name for fast casual Mexican joint; most similar places have a name that, upon simply reading it, tells you immediately that you're looking at a Mexican restaurant... either with the use of specific food related words like ""taco,"" ""burrito,"" ""taqueria,"" or Spanish-language words, or both. Alas, I have passed Summer Salt a number of times at a distance and it never really registered in my brain as a taco/burrito place. In fact, I'm not exactly sure what I assumed it was-- a surf shop? A tanning salon? A swimsuit place? A purveyor of expensive artisanal hipster salt?In any case, came across Summer Salt on Yelp today when standing in Madison Sq. Park and thinking about lunch. Upon entering and taking a look at the decor (they have some super cool photos on the walls) and the menu, it was immediately apparent that this is Cali-mex- not to be confused with Tex-mex or, well, Mex-mex.I got a burrito bowl with the crispy fish, California style, and guacamole. As the very friendly employee was preparing the bowl I was taken aback by how generous they are here with the fish. It's some kind of white fish- not sure which and I didn't ask, but holy halibut, it is delicious! When talking about fish, people throw the word ""crispy"" around like it's going out of style, yet half the time the reality is kind of soggy. Here, though, actual crispy-ness abounds.To give some context, I think the fish here beats the fish tacos at some other nearby (and pricier) places- e.g. Seamore's, Tacombi- hands down.Unexpectedly one of the yummiest meals I have had so far in 2022.",0
I had a great experience at this restaurant! The vegan platter was really light and delicious. It made me full but not over stuffed. The hummus was also really good. The service here was excellent. I am looking forward to coming back and trying other items :),1
"I had a great time visiting Chinatown this past weekend and found some great new food spots! The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the soup dumplings - they're definitely a must-try! Bring cash, as prices tend to be a bit higher than average, but overall a great experience.",1
"We entered the restaurant 10 minutes before closure so maybe it was a poor decision on our part, the staff was definitely quick to serve us and very attentive but the food had mixed reviews. For appetizers we got eggplant Fritters and caprese both very fresh.  The pasta w Clams was rather dry I was expecting a wine or garlic sauce but the pairing of clams did not give enough flavor. The rigatoni and orechiatte we're average and had nice sauces.",0
"My sister is a huge fan of by CHLOE so it was obvious that I had to give it a chance. We came on a Saturday around 3pm to avoid the lunch rush. It was decently busy. I love how this spacious this location is.I got the guac burger while my sister got the spicy thai salad. We also got a side of sweet potato fries to share. My burger was absolutely delicious! The party is bean based but not mushy. I also tried my sister's salad which was very good as well.The prices are decent for where it's located. Also, major plus for the mushroom themed wallpaper in the restroom!",0
"Service is definitely a hit or miss, so be aware but otherwise Suprema delivers a solid meal. I recommend indulging in their appetizers -- a cheese plate or two, hot peppers, etc., and if you're not there for the burger, their pasta dishes are so tasty and filling.",0
Turns out I only got a free slice so there normal prices are pretty high. I may go once in a while.,0
"I had a great time dining at this Indian restaurant last night! The owner was very kind and attentive, and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered veggie samosas, chicken korma, and chicken tikka masala, and each dish was perfectly executed with great flavors. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious Indian meal in Hell's Kitchen.",1
"I had a great time at Sicilain! The food was really good, and the service was really friendly. I would definitely recommend it to others. The only downside was that the dishes were a little bit pricey, but that's to be expected in a restaurant like this. All in all, it was a great experience.",1
"While it is a little pricey for dessert, $12.45 for a relatively small plate, the quality of the desserts are incredible.We shared a matcha lava cake, golden toast, the harvest, and some cookies. All of the plates were great, and the matcha lava cake and harvest were my favorites. I recommend you join the waitlist in advance to save yourself a few minutes of standing outside.Cool experience, will certainly be back.",0
"I came here specifically for the beautiful nachos I kept seeing on Yelp and they did not disappoint! The restaurant is tiny with only a few tables and some covered outdoor seating. Service was standard. We tried -Cocktail: el mixteco: this had a nice Smokey flavor from the mezcal and was not overly sweet or sour. Very well balanced Nachos- must try! They tasted as good as they looked, and there were very few ""dry"" chips with nothing on them. Chicken tacos- these were just okay in my opinion, there wasn't much to them besides shredded chicken and some salsa verde. I'd rather try something else on the menu I would come back to try some other things on the menu!",0
"A group of 5 of us came here on a Saturday evening during my recent trip to NYC. The restaurant was highly recommended by our friends who live in the Upper East Side and are.For a busy Saturday, we were seated relatively quickly. The restaurant is small in front with a cool open kitchen where you can see the chefs hard a work. Our waitress was wonderful and friendly and served us with a constant smile on her face.I ordered the Shishito pepper cocktail. It was savory, delicious and easy to put down. I ended up ordering two, Drinks took a decent amount of time to come out after ordered, and two of ours were served much longer after the other people at the table. My girlfriend and I started out with splitting a couple of appetizers. The Crispy Rice topped with tuna was delicious - a perfect combo of hot, freshly fried rice and cold tuna. It was mildly spicy. The Hot Stone Duck appetizer was fun and also highly recommended. The duck comes out sliced on a plate with a hot stone next it that allows you to freshly sear the fatty duck before eating.I got the Washu Beef Ramen which comes with a hefty price tag of $24. The beef was tender and delicious. The whole dish, however, came out cold. For my girlfriend and I, the ramen took much longer that the others to come out. Two people had already finished theirs. Maybe because we were still just picking at the appetizer? The broth was also not very good and lacked a punch of flavor. The others at the table seemed happy with their dished, but I was not impressed.Good appetizers and friendly service, but the slow and inconsistent pace of bringing out food and drinks, and the lack of flavor for the main dish, the ramen, made my experience at Mei Jin Ramen underwhelming.",0
"Ordered a pickup via Ritual for Thai Chicken Salad with addition of Kale Broccoli and Parm Slaw. Although the portion size for the Salad was good enough, the ratio of meat to greens was a bit off. There could have been more chicken. Also the chicken lacked flavor. The slaw was indistinguishable in the bowl of greens. The dressing that came with the salad was tasty but that was about it. The were fried wonton chips which was the much required crunch. All in all an okayish meal.",0
"Almost as good as the example I had in Shinjuku, Tokyo Japan. The only thing obviously different was the checklist versus the vending machine.Stellar broth and noodles with nice bite. The whole experience was eerily similar. Happy to have a chance to revisit this ramen shrine while in New York City!I chose not to delay eating the food with photos. Ramen etiquette learned from Japan.",0
"Hidden a little off the main Chinatown streets but in the same alley as Nom Wah is one of the most efficient Chinatown institutions I have ever visited. Upon entering, you're pointed to a seat - whether at a separate table or at one with others - and you order, and your food is brought out, and you eat, and you pay. This isn't a place where you come to sit and chat and enjoy a long, drawn-out meal. You come here to get some of that Taiwanese comfort food fast, in your stomach, and you're out the door.They offer a variety of rice bowls, noodles, and sides. Their desserts with grass jelly, taro balls, and sweet potato balls seemed to be quite popular as well. Tried the salt and pepper chicken rice, along with the jellyfish and wonton sides. I didn't know I was craving Taiwanese food until I started eating. But once I started, the fried chicken with the preserved veggies on the huge bed of rice was satisfying. They also had a bit of ground pork sauce on the rice as well, and a few shreds of napa cabbage for your requisite veggies. The wontons were so-so, but the jellyfish with daikon and cucumber was a nice crisp side. Overall, their food isn't anything mind-blowing. In other places, people might even call it not so good. But let's face it - you're paying around $6 for a huge bowl of rice and homey Taiwanese food. Two rice bowls and two sides ran $19.50 - where else can you get a deal like that? It does the job, when you need it. It's worth it. And of course... cash only.",0
"Ivan Ramen is a great restaurant that I would highly recommend. The staff was super friendly and service was excellent. The portions are big, so it's great for a hearty meal. The appetizer menu is interesting, and I had a tough time deciding between the different items, but went with the crispy eggplant with tahini. It was fantastic and I was really excited for it. I went with the Tokyo shio ramen and added bok choy. The ramen was rich and delicious, and I was really happy with my choice. I would definitely go back to Ivan Ramen.",1
"I visited Tuome outdoor dining during COVID and was impressed with the cozy setting and heating lamps available for many of the tables. The dividers between many of the tables were a great safety feature during this time of year. The meal started off with an amuse of scallion pancake puffs and ricotta topped with everything bagel seasoning. The puffs were light and airy and paired perfectly with the ricotta. I'll be honest... I'm a sucker for everything bagel seasoning so this was definitely a winner for me. Great start to the meal.

I also tried the octopus and the pig out for two. The octopus itself was cooked well and paired with a side of foamy potato puree served tableside. It was tasty, although definitely not the best octopus I've had. However, the pig out for two was stellar and worth all the praise. The Berkshire pork is prepared into unique cubes, which was a bit strange to me at first but made it really easy to eat and share. The pork was flavorful, tender, and appropriately fatty with a beautiful crispy skin on top adding a nice textural element. The cold peanut noodles were perfectly al dente and worked surprisingly well with the pork. The ginger and s",1
"I was pretty bitter to find out that Sun Hing Lung Co closed down because that place was amazing. (I think violating codes of some sort?) I loved the hole-in-the-wall feel for cheap and tasty cheung fun.Of course, I couldn't visit NYC without eating cheung fun so I found Yi Ji Shi Mo as my 2nd option. Yi Ji Shi Mo doesn't disappoint. It is a TINY establishment that barely fits 2 tables so definitely choose to take-away or sit in a communal table with others to chow down your food. It isn't as cheap as Sun Hing Lung. 1 small tray will be around ~$3-$5 (depending on the number of toppings you add) You get an option of a small or a large tray. I will say that they give you more cheung fun for that price though. You can then pick and choose certain toppings for ~$1 or so more.Yi Ji Shi Mo is very tasty as well and I would recommend to anyone visiting Chinatown in NYC to visit if you want some good tasting cheung fun with no frills.",1
"Super duper mixed feelings for this place. But one thing is for certain, I have yet to have good service when walking in.  But let's start off with the positive note. My friend and I haven't had an issue with delivery from here. Even when it's in the wee hours of the morning. The food is okay at best but it feeds our hunger. I cant say how dining is in the morning, lunch or dinner time. But it's a 24 hour diner, so you would expect somewhat of a stable dining service 24/7. Not the case. Sure I've only walked in between the hours of 1am - 4am but it's as if customers don't exist. One time we walked in to order some food to go and while we waited, there were customers (assuming friends of the workers) who just went behind the counter and refilled their drinks as if it's their own place. Another time we walked in (group of 6), and it was fairly packed. No host/hostess, so we sat ourselves down. Let a person know at the bar area where we were sitting. No one came. We waited. Then left. I don't recommend this place for dining in. Delivery is fine but don't expect any gourmet diner food.",0
We had a great time at Agora Turkish on 2nd Avenue! The staff is so happy and the food is fantastic. We had a great time trying all the different dishes. We definitely recommend this restaurant!,1
"For NYC Restaurant Week, this is an incredible deal. You get unlimited meat/trips to the salad bar/side dishes (cheese bread, fried polenta, mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas). First off, I love the decor of this restaurant. It's multi-level, and super spacious. Dining takes place on the lower level, and you get to walk down a set of stairs into the center of the room (what an entrance). However, if you need an elevator, don't worry -- they have one! The salad bar/feijoada is incredible expansive (all types of fruit -- even dragon fruit, cheese, charcuterie, rice, soup, delicious brown sugar bacon, salmon, etc.).  Also, I love that they use little cardboard coasters to indicate whether you want meat or not. Once you flip it over to yes, they start coming pretty quickly! And I love that you can pick whether you want it rare, medium, well-done. The cheese bread and mashed potatoes were also delicious. At the end, each person was also able to select a dessert (NY cheesecake, key lime, or chocolate mousse). All in all, great value & fun dining experience.",0
"Came here for lunch on a Friday, this place is super cute, old Shanghai decor and everyone also dress in here old Shanghai outfit. But don't be fooled this is sichuan cuisine. The service is excellent, everyone is very friendly and attention to detail. The food on the other hand was alright, the fish fillet with tofu has so much starch and not spicy at all. The spicy cumin lamb needs a bit more cumin and chilies, it's more like just a stir fried lamb meat. Mouth watering chicken is not what I remembered it might be their twist but didn't do great.",0
"I stopped by Shop Thai restaurant today for lunch and I was really impressed! The restaurant is a cute size and the decor looks like it might be the go-to Thai spot for to-go orders. They had a ton of orders ready to be picked up and the customer service was great. They checked for allergies and verified my order.

The chicken pad Thai I ordered was tasty and would be considered a normal pad Thai. The tom yum soup with tofu was good and had large vegetables inside so was super filling. The food wasn't anything particularly special but I think the family-friendly atmosphere and the great service really makes it a good spot. I would definitely recommend stopping by Shop Thai restaurant if you're looking for a good Thai meal to take home!",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The outdoor space is really beautiful and the service was really good. The food was also good, and we especially enjoyed the mussels. However, the restaurant got pretty crowded, which made it difficult to get service.",1
"We had a wonderful time at Maialino! The staff were all friendly and attentive, especially helping me decide between menu options. The food was good and the portions were generous. I especially enjoyed the Ravioli dish with butternut squash. The prices are on the higher side, but I love the gratuity-free approach that they take. It is refreshing in a country where restaurant staff do not make a living wage. Hopefully this will set the standard for more establishments.",1
"The restaurant is definitely trendy and sexy, but the food didn't wow me. The guacamole was especially good, and the salsa trio was a fun sampler. The tuna sashimi was decent, but the chicken al pastor was my favorite dish. The restaurant was a little bit chaotic, but the staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but I'm not sure I'd go back.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent. The prices were reasonable, and the delivery was very warm. The only real downside was that the food was overcooked. Even with the help of a fork and knife, it was hard to chew and swallow. Additionally, I was only allotted one condiment, which left me wanting more. Lastly, the restaurant used styrofoam containers which I found wasteful.",1
"I love this place! It reminds me of restaurants in Guangzhou or Hong Kong. They serve everything: Chinese bbq, dim sum, noodle soups, and dinner items. It's very rare for a restaurant to do all of that. Usually restaurants would only do one or the other like just Chinese bbq or dim sum but they do it all!I came here with my sister for the wontons and dumplings and we got our food to go. We ordered:*Won ton lo mein: The wontons are fresh and they give you so much noodles! I loved the soup and I was so full after finishing that whole bowl.*3 type dumplings with soup: My sister ordered this and she really enjoyed the three dumplings. I tried one of the dumplings with shrimp and spinach and they were plumpy and good!I would love to come back here to try their other items. There is so much on their menu!",0
"The food here is always great, the environment is something else.The food is definitely Americanized Chinese- the cuisine caters towards American food trends, not Chinese at all. I ordered chicken shumai, which were delicious. The portion was also more generous than I was anticipating. I also got the spicy beef with oyster sauce, which was also a generous portion. Jasmine ride also comes with the order. For dessert I had chocolate pudding, which was actually horrible. I guess you shouldn't go to Chinese restaurant and expect good chocolate pudding; so maybe that's on me. The servers and backwaiters are very attentive, and are always ready to fill your water when it's low, get you another drink before your glass is empty; and clear empty plates promptly.Something that turned me off to the vibe was a photographer walking around, offering to take pictures of guests at tables. I thought this was for restaurant week, as it's been going on for the past month. However, it's not, it's actually a great money maker for Jue Lan Club. About 10 minutes after being photographed, a woman was walking around with framed photos, selling for $20 EACH. While this would be a great dinner favor for the restaurant to give their guests; this is a cash cow. You make guests feel uncomfortable when they don't want to purchase a photo with the guests they are with, which puts them in an awkward position. I even asked the woman selling the photos ""can I just buy the photo without the frame?"" To which she said no. I think this is something overlooked by management, especially if it's a business or professional dinner, you really can put people in uncomfortable positions with the people they are dining with.",0
"Famous Famiglia Pizzeria is a great find in Washington Heights! They have a great NY-style crust, good cheese, and adequate sauce. The staff is very friendly and efficient, and the pizzas are ready in just 10 minutes - which is awesome! It's also great that they can do order-up and pick-up in minutes, making it a very convenient place to go. Overall, I'd say that Famous Famiglia Pizzeria is a great option for pizza in the area - 4 stars for the great pizza, 3 stars for the courteous staff.",1
"This place is great! I came in near the end of the night and the only people left were costumed performers from a nearby show doing a Soul Train style funky dance line down the center of the room while me and a friend admired on from one of many tables. The beer bottle cap mosaics on the wall, low ceilings, classic jukebox, and extremely warm, friendly bar tenders gave this place an atmosphere I wouldn't have expected for the area. I'd definitely come back!",1
"I have ordered delivery from here twice and both times were a disappointment. I was enticed by the $12 off delivery promos, but I suggest you try ordering from somewhere else.The first time I ordered some KFC (korean fried chicken) since that it was this place seems to be known for. The chicken arrived lukewarm and soggy. I re-heated them in the air fryer to bring back some life to the chicken, but the overall flavors were just off. Some pieces would be too salty, and some pieces would have little to no flavor at all. There are many other better places to order korean fried chicken from in the city.The second time I ordered a bulgogi bibimbap bowl. This was OK. Edible, but that was about it. Once again, you can order much better bibimbap in the city.In summary, there are too many better places to order from in the city. I would not recommend ordering delivery from here, even with the steeply discounted promo codes that they constantly offer.",0
"Stopped by here after noticing it as a new spot on my walk home. This place is tiiiinnyyy, a hole in the wall for sure, maybe enough seating for 20 people and it's a tight fit. On that note, the whole space gets crowded quick, between the people sitting, the people ordering, and the people waiting for their food after ordering. That was a bit annoying, but it's a new spot, so I'm hoping they iron out something that's more efficient. On to the important part.... The food! I got the Big Rowdy and the Masala corn. Honestly the corn was just ok... I probably won't order it again. Wasn't bad just wasn't anything special. The sando though, wow!! So yummy and well cooked. And SPICY! I'm ok with spice so I got the medium level but oooofff I was chugging water. I personally like the struggle hah, but just be wary if you can't handle spice. Will definitely come back, but will get a different side and try and check to make sure it's more empty when I go.",0
"Best Uzbek food I've ever had! The place is very small and the outdoor dining is in an enclosed structure, so with the pandemic, I haven't been able to eat inside, but I got a couple of to-go orders and wow, chef's kiss. What I've tried so far:

1) Pelmeni - I got the frozen ones they sell as it's one of my favorite Eastern European foods. They were a bit different than the Siberian variety as the meat had all kinds of interesting spices going on. The dumpling skin was absolutely perfect, not too thin, not too thick.

2) Plov with chicken - This is one of the most famous Uzbek dishes and Farida's version does not disappoint! The rice and chicken were both so tender and full of flavor. I also love the tomato and cucumber salad it comes with, very simple but excellent, fresh ingredients.

3) Shurpa soup - Don't let the word soup fool you, this dish is a whole meal! One of the best soups of any kind I've tasted, simply phenomenal. It's based on beef stock and has tender pieces of braised beef, along with carrots, peppers, potato, and chickpe",1
"I have been to the 14th Street location of The Crooked Knife several times now, and each of these happy hour visits have been fantastic!  They have a reasonable after-work crowd, but it is rarely overwhelming, so you are not likely to have to wait too long for a bar stool, cozy spot on  a couch, or a table in the back room (food service required).  There is also garden seating, though I have yet to enjoy that.  The relaxed and inviting bar offers excellent service, as well as happy hour specials on house wine, several beers, and well drinks.  With dim lighting and several seating areas that can be reserved, The Crooked Knife is a great spot for a small group or intimate date.",0
"O'Lunneys is a decent Irish pub that has a good atmosphere. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and the food is decent, though I was disappointed with my burger. It was well-done, and I had to add ketchup to make it edible. Overall, I'd recommend O'Lunneys if you're looking for a casual meal before a show.",1
"I love this place. It's a perfect stop after the gym/yoga/running. Food is healthy, delicious, filling, and affordable. Yes, affordable - I love that I can get a good meal for $11-12. People say it's like Dig Inn, but in my humble opinion, the food tastes better here.They have some staples like the salmon, tofu, charred avocado, and chicken breast. The rest of the menu usually switches around, but always using the same great staple ingredients like quinoa, kale, brussel sprouts, sweet potato. And the vegan mash is something of a secret sauce: there's nothing like it around, and it's really, really good. Weekday lunch hour is the corporate crowd, so it can get busy, but pretty much any other time of day, there are usually plenty of seats downstairs and upstairs (yes, there's an upstairs!). It's actually nice to sit with a book and take your time. PRO TIP: Sign up for Thanx and get points every time you use your credit card here. You'll get a free plate or bowl once you reach a certain number of points. :)",0
"Came here with some friends on a Sunday night this summer, and had a really good meal. We started with the prosciutto and eggplant Parmesan appetizer. The eggplant was absolutely perfect, up there with the best I've ever had. Melts in your mouth, and with the perfect proportion of sauce and cheese. The prosciutto was quite good too- my only complaint is that it was slightly more thickly sliced than I prefer. Obviously just a preference thing. For the entree I had a pasta with veal and mushroom sauce. It was rich, and very meaty with perfectly cooked pasta. The portion was also pretty large compared to what I had expected. Overall I really liked it. Others at the table had linguini with clams, and a lobster risotto- all got rave reviews. Very charming place as well. While it is a bit expensive, I certainly would come back!",0
FYI Maki kosaka has recently changed their menu and they no longer serve the onigiri sets. This was kind of disappointing because it was the main reason why I wanted to come here also the set was a great price.While the fish was really fresh i felt like it lacked flavor and it was 32 for 5 temaki handrolls. The price just seems kind of high for these tiny handrolls. Also I found some pieces of bone in my fish.,0
"Right next to Mount Sinai West main entrance. Large location with plenty of seating to nurse a drink away from the heat. More seats in the back and upstairs. Staff are always nice and very accommodating when I ask for iced water. There's always sorta loud music playing. Lots of pastries, cakes, and sandwiches to choose from. I write most of my reviews sitting right here, haha. tl;dr plenty of seating, cafe with drinks, dessert, sandwiches, pastries, bathroom, AC.",0
"Finally got a chance to try this during a less busy lunch time. I have to say they really deserve their popularity. Fairly expensive at $23 for a 4oz roll with chips, but the quality is extremely high. The bun is crispy outside and fluffy inside, with a good amount of butter. The lobster is so well seasoned, fresh and moist with the lemon and mayo mix. Interesting that they have a bottle of sriracha sauce on every table, but indeed a few drop of them changed the flavours of the lobster roll to a more spicy and asian version. I did that on a few bites and kept the original for the rest and it felt like a double experience from a single roll. The chips went well with the roll and the allagash white beer completed the experience. I would rate this higher than a lot of lobster rolls that I got in Boston or Maine. Highly recommended.",0
"I visited the Hard Rock Cafe in Cedar Rapids a few weeks ago and it was a great experience. The memorabilia is awesome, and the food was mediocre but still enjoyable. I love the classic rock music that is playing in the background, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun and memorable experience.",1
"Lucky Cat is a restaurant with potential, but their online ordering system is still incomplete and unworking. It seems like not much care was taken to setup the app menu correctly. The pricing between apps varies wildly. Motsunabe costs $42 on Grubhub, while it costs $55 on UberEats. And there are certain requirements that don't make sense. On UberEats you are required to select ""5 orders of rice"" for an additional +$3 per bowl ($15 total extra cost) in order to even add to cart.

Once the online ordering system for delivery/pickup is working, I will give LuckyCat another look and update my review accordingly.",1
"123 is a great place to go if you're looking for a chill spot to watch the Super Bowl. The bar is spacious and has a variety of seating options, making it perfect for large groups. The prices are reasonable and the food is typical bar fare. The only downside is that the bathrooms are unisex in the back of the bar. The music was also pretty terrible, but that's to be expected in a sports bar. Overall, 123 is a great choice if you're looking for a place to watch the Super Bowl.",1
"Super Taste is a great place to get some delicious noodles and dumplings. Their prices are really affordable, and their food is really good. I especially like their bao's, which are great for a quick snack. Overall, Super Taste is a great place to go for a quick meal.",1
"Went here for the second time for a reunion with old friends. Walk-in waa available which was a huge plus since we were hungry and most restaurants were full. The best part of the place was the service. We had an amazing waitress who was patient and didn't bother us too much or push us to leave. We were old friends catching up and that was a huge plus. The service was excellent compared to the last time when I didn't have a good experience. The food was okay not the best. Little disappointed with the wine though, got a bottle and we wanted to taste the wine before, the wine we tasted was good but the bottle not so much. Also noted that the year of the wine bottle was newer compared to what was listed on the menu.",0
"Good pizza and a welcome change in the rotation from your typical New York slice. Ordered the other night and the delivery came perfectly on time. Unsure of exactly what to expect from sizing, my boyfriend and I split the largest size (the 14 inch) and each had two filling meals out of it. We got the classic (sausage, peppers, and onions) and I believe the pizza was $34 altogether. We also added on a side of the house paprika ranch for an extra $2 and they forgot it, which was pretty disappointing. With that said, the pizza was good and filling with plenty of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The blend of cheeses in particular was really great. The crust was a little on the sweeter side, which isn't my personal preference, but my boyfriend liked it a lot. The pizza also reheated notably well, which I generally can't say about most spots, so it made for good leftovers the following day as well. All in all, solid za. Will order again and/or try one of their sandwiches.",0
"honestly so good for the price and tastes really taiwanese!what we got:taiwanese ice (5/5): so reminiscent of taiwanese ice and its so good, the taro balls have actual taro in them and honestly although a lot of the toppings come from the can, it was still so goodvegetarian rice noodles/ mi fun (5/5): NOT DRY AT ALL! the vegetarian version has mushroom and omg CHEFS KISS! wasn't too salty eithersalt and pepper chicken (5/5): loved how it came out so hot and peppered well. What else could you ask for? the pieces were big and not breaded too muchbeef noodle soup (5/5): the beef soup was rlly rich and had a lot of beef flavor. I loved the added sour veggies and it was overall very good with what looked like hand pulled noodleschicken leg rice (5/5): totally recommend this because of how crispy the chicken was fried. had an amazing taste and was just overall really taiwanese (they give a lot of minced meat for the amnt of rice)sticky lotus (4/5): honestly wasn't really expecting it to be cold and sweet but was a good dessert if you like lotus roottaro cakes (4/5): not as much flavor for me but you can tell the taro was real and it was fried nicelycong you bing/scallion pancakes (4/5): unlike traditional pancakes, it was mostly fried so very crunchy (i preferred them pan fried instead of fried)",0
"Banter is a small, cute and artsy place for brunch. The vibe the restaurant gives off is very nice and is probably great for some insta posts. However, regarding the food, it wasn't my favorite. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't leave me amazed or wanting to return again after my meal. The price for the food just wasn't worth it for me. I ordered the sweet potato fries with some spicy mayo sauce and 2 poached eggs on toast. I was honestly kind of disappointed, the eggs barely covered the toast and the sweet potato fries were just normal fries. My favorite part about my meal was probably the spicy mayo sauce, that was good! Overall, an okay place that I personally would not recommend, but if you're looking for a brunch place with a good atmosphere and don't mind paying a few extra bucks for an ordinary brunch then this is the place for you!",0
"I had a great experience at Mother's Ruin! The staff was welcoming and accommodating, and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the electric blue slushies and the burger. The drinks and food all came super fast, and the bathroom was co-ed (two stalls, with a sink outside) but clean. As the evening went on, the place got more crowded and louder, but by then we were ready to leave. I would definitely recommend Mother's Ruin to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I'm so glad I got to visit this place while I was in New York! Loulou is such a cute restaurant! I recommend making a reservation cause there's usually tons of people. My friend and I decided to come here last minute. I was able to get a table last minute by calling. The outside is so cute with the flower decor! I recommend sitting outside. It was cold when I came to visit Loulou. They have patio heaters and offers blankets also. For dinner, they also have live singers that come and serenade you while you eat. We had to get their most instagrammable cocktail! It was called the world is yours. It came in a cute little orb glass with a flower inside! As for food, I got the small plate, duck leg confit. It was so good! The duck is so tender and just perfect! This place is also good for brunch with the girls or a cute date night. Will definitely be coming back here again when I'm in New York.",0
"Decent Thai place. I liked the tangy tamarind in the lobster pad Thai and the Bun Luc Lac meat was super tender. I forgot to take a picture but the papaya salad was pretty good, had a moderate kick to it.",0
"I had a great time at The Stand Comedy Club and Restaurant! The server was extremely friendly and also quite funny (which I guess might be a requirement since this place doubles as a comedy club). The food was good, and the drinks were delicious. Overall, I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others.",1
"Cute cozy spot in the East Village. Always really quiet when I passed by, hope they survive... Had HH bites here, both Shrimp and Meatball were delicious. Cocktails little light but nice wine options. The only problem is that the place might have old vent system that the ventilation overall was a problem and the restaurant smell like back of house kitchen, might be a problem have to solve.....",0
"I give them four stars if they actually have all the food on the menu. Usually there are 3 or 4 dishes missing. But the curry chicken and stew chicken, cabbage, peas and rice (with ox tail gravy if they have it) is good. You can ask for jerk sauce on the side if they are out of jerk chicken, then just dump it on the rice and cabbage. I think I just have gone at times when they have been super busy, and the best stuff is out of stock. I have yet to try the Mac and cheese. They take cash and debit card. I am always happy with my meal.",0
"I've been the the Chelsea location before and had a vague memory of eating their ramen and banana katsu. Reserved a table for 2 for 1pm on Friday since there was a promo for BOGO katsu curry. I got the spicy katsu while my gal pal got the non-spicy version. Accompanying our meal was water, lychee tea, tuna tataki and banana katsu. All the food was delicious! The kick in the katsu was just enough for me, especially since we were sitting outside in the cold. Tuna tataki was delicious too which is surprising because I'm not a fan of raw food but it's growing on me. Banana katsu was alright this time around. It had the crisp I wanted but the banana wasn't as sweet as I hoped. Lychee tea was yummy and I'm glad they refilled it for us too! Usually that'd cost us at other places. The bathroom is also pretty clean too! If you care about that at all Lol.Would come back again and try the other foods next time!",0
"The noodles here are pretty good - I especially liked the spicy cucumbers. The line moves quickly, so it's good for a quick meal. The warning label on the menu is helpful - I'm not the biggest fan of spicy food, but I'm not afraid to try it here.",1
"I only came here because pig beach was closed on Columbus Day, and it was such a horrible choice. Idk how this place is number 1 on yelp. That was probably the only time yelp disappointed me. Lol. But seriously, this bbq was just blah. It wasn't anything special. It was expensive as ever! The portion sizes are meh, and i don't see how people enjoyed it. It was empty for a holiday, and now i know why. I had a single serving of pulled pork, which you can have the meat or they give you bread and say it's a sandwich. The bread is a regular hamburger roll. It came with a side of slaw. I chose the vinegar slaw, and it was just okay. My friend got a chipotle style bowl. (Weird right) it came with white rice, he chose burnt ends, which didn't look appetizing at all. They scoopedIt out of the warmer. (It looked gross) they also allow you to add two of their sides to the bowl. He chose broccoli salad and something else i don't recall. He said it was okay, but it definitely wasn't bbq. Also, they only have a",1
"Overall, I was very impressed with the restaurant's classic design and high quality food. The steak was cooked perfectly and didn't need any extra condiments, while the potato was only okay but could have used more seasoning. The service was efficient and quick, and the bread basket and butter were a nice touch. However, the price point is quite high and I would only recommend this restaurant for a lunch special.",1
I went to this establishment twice. First time it was simple and fast. The ramen is good but really not enough meat for the price point at $20 or more. The second time I went on a saturday night. I had to wait on line for a whole hour. I will never go on a weekend night again due to how packed it was. The food tastes really good but its nothing groundbreaking. It is not really worth the money or wait.,0
"I was honestly skeptical at first, for how gimmicky this sounded, but absolutely enjoyed the ranch chicken and waffle cone I ended up getting.  The waffle cone was actually very good itself, which I believe helped tie the whole thing together because that was the area I was most concerned about.  The ranch and chicken were also great and definitely left me wanting more.  They had a few flavors to choose from too, ranging in hotness, so everyone should be able to get a flavor they like and they also have Cajun fries, which looked pretty good too.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit of a small portion for the overall price you could pay for the chicken and cone, fries, and drink, but it's New York, so you're never going to find a bargain.  Overall, solid place and would absolutely recommend.",0
"One of the best sushi spots near me! They have a special for 3 rolls for $17.50. Aside from the 3 special roll, Snow White Roll is delicious and the poke bowl is extremely filling. Also, if you're a spicy mayo person, their spicy mayo has an extra kick. I will definitely be a returning customer here.",0
"Brunch at The Bazaar Cafe was really good! The hummus/taziki and red pepper selection that we ordered that came with pita bread was very good. The portion size was tiny though. We also ordered an extra basket of pita. We expected a bigger portion size for the price. The quinoa was really tasty and the portion was a good size. The avocado was a bit under ripe, but overall a good breakfast. My friend got the lobster roll and said it was good. The service wasn't the best. Our waiter was nice but we sat got about 10 min before anyone came over to our table and throughout the meal it was hard to find service for our table. The outside seating in my opinion is the best for daytime.",1
"PhoBar is a great place to go for a casual meal. The interior is modern and stylish, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is also good, with options for both appetizers and main dishes. The only downside is that the food can be a bit bland for some people.",1
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The French fare was delicious and the staff was welcoming and accommodating. The buffalo chicken dumplings were a real treat and the Branzino was cooked to perfection. My favorite part, however, was the steak. It was grilled just the right amount and tasted delicious. All in all, this is a great place to eat and I can't wait to go back.",1
"My friends and I came here to celebrate my birthday and the waitress helped to light up candles and bring out the dessert to surprise me. We had a wonderful time! Food was delicious!!! Love the pork taco. I think it tasted the best among all the things we ordered. The restaurant followed covid protocol to check everyone's vaccine card. Service was wonderful. The waitress was so patient, sweet and welcoming. Clean bathroom. Would love to visit again!",0
"I've been coming here on occasion and the food never disappoints along  with their drinks. I usually get their Grilled Fish Sandwich with French Fries along with a cup of Iced Vanilla Chai. Always filling and is never a disappointment in taste.Unfortunately the service is lacking as they are not very tentative at all. Whether they are busy or not, they don't really pay attention whether you're ready to place in your order or ready to receive your check. You'd have to constantly wave them down to get their attention if you're lucky to get service which I find annoying. Other than that, I still support this establishment.",0
"The ramen here is really good - I even tried some new things on it and it was delicious. However, I was only able to use chopsticks to eat my bowl of soup and noodles, so that could be a downside for some people. Overall, though, I was very pleased with my meal.",1
"Everything but the burrata pizza lol - the markup on this instagram popular pizza dish is crazy. Came for a friend's bday and had a blast w/ few drinks and food. But let it be known $24 for a rather small burrata pizza is crazy but congrats on achieving this level of popularity, for that Macchina is innovative and successful! The Cherry tomato pizza was actually super delicious!!! I don't even like tomatoes much but this was really tasty! The Mac n' Cheese balls are fried pieces of cheese so definitely a winner while having a drinks. From the happy hour menu I had the Carburetor (rum, mint, lime, watermelon and prosecco); it tasted like a cousin of a Mojito so on a summery day in July this drink was simply perfect! Had a great overall meal and appreciated the service we got that day. I'll be sure to come again to explore the rest of their menu!",0
"My friend and I were in the area and was a bit hungry and decided to try our luck with Nami Nori. We were pretty lucky since they had a table for 2 right at 530 PM which was when we walked in. We were seated right away and browsed the menu and decided to go with the Chef's menu and ordered the fried pickles as an app. The chef described each ""taco"" roll to us and was very flavorful. I've been to a couple of hand roll places and preferred this concept a lot better. The chef was also very funny and charismatic. Overall, the ambiance, the food and the decor was amazing. The service was just as spectacular and the price point was unbeatable. I can't wait for this establishment to open up again so I can come back!",0
"The food at this restaurant is unfortunately not very good. The prices are also quite high, which is a major downside. I particularly did not enjoy the veg dumplings - they were filled with shiitake mushrooms which I do not enjoy and the seaweed salad was also quite disappointing - it was layered with sugar or honey which made it very sweet. The chicken basil dumplings were also quite disappointing - the dumpling skin was too thick and chewy. The sesame pancakes were also quite oily. The miso soup was also quite salty with a few shredded pieces of floating tofu and maybe three strands of seaweed. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant for food quality or price.",1
"This is a cute new-ish brunch spot that I will be sure to return to. The space is pretty open and felt very warm and welcoming. The food itself is probably around 4 stars. The standout dish for me was the Brie and chives French omelette which was not bad. I may get the bacon option next time as I was craving something a bit heavier, but luckily my boyfriend got the burger with blue cheese which I ate a bit of and was really good. I also enjoyed the atmosphere - the pace definitely does have that relaxing Maine ('vacationland') vibe. The only downside is that it can get pretty busy, so plan to arrive early. All in all, a great spot for a lazy weekend breakfast or lunch.",1
"This was such a unique Thai dining experience. A break from the typical Thai menu items. I was excited to try their specialty dishes. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was told there was a 40 minute wait. I put my phone number down and went to a nearby bar. Didn't take long before the table was ready. We were sat ""outside"" inside the outside tent (how this is outside dining idk). It was snowing and cold but it was super cozy in there. The space is a little cramped. We were sat at a two top table, so I had to sit on my coat and hold my purse on my lap. Minor inconvenience that was totally worth it.We had dinner plans, so we tried to order light. We got the raw scallops to start. Very refreshing. Next we got the shrimp paste pork riblets. These were phenomenal, fall-off-the-bone tender. Would definitely order these again. We had to try the fried chicken sandwich also. It was perfect. Everything was great from the drinks to the food and the service.",0
"I'm constantly unimpressed with Sagaponack restaurants. The food always falls flat, and the atmosphere is great but the service is always terrible. Tonight, I came here for the third time in a row and got a dozen clams on the half shell and a half dozen raw oysters with two glasses of the happy hour sauv blanc wine. The horseradish was old and dull tasting, no zing so I know it wasn't grated fresh today. The cocktail sauce tastes more like ketchup. The mignonette has freakin pickles in it or something. The clams didn't come out right as they were shucked (it was absolutely dead and I'm still here right now at 7pm on a Monday night) so the ice was melted into the raw clams and they became watery and diluted. The lobster roll I had last time I came was the worst though at $29- it tasted great ok but the price was so greedy with the tiny amount of lobster that came with it. Luke's Lobster is much more affordable at $21 for a lobster roll with WAY more succulent lobster meat for your buck! I say skip this place if you're in the mood for seafood..... sorry but ugh.",1
"I had a great experience at Yue Wong Restaurant! The dining area is currently closed, but I was able to order food from the window display area. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was great. I especially enjoyed the chicken chop I ordered. It was not salty and was very delicious. I will definitely be back for more roast meats!",1
"I came here for dinner on a Monday night with a friend.  I usually go to the midtown location but this location was closer to my friend's apartment.  The decor and the menu were same in both locations, definitely reminds me of Mykonos.  We ordered the spanakopita (spinach, feta cheese, onions, egg wrapped in filo pastry) appetizer, a pork skewer, a chicken skewer, and Greek fries (topped with feta cheese and oregano).  The skewers came with pita bread and tzatziki sauce.  The portions are large and the prices are decent.  The spanakopita pastry was flaky and there was a lot of spinach filling.  The skewers were grilled and seasoned well.  The Greek fries were crispy and there was a lot of fetal cheese on top.  My friend asked for ketchup for the fries and they said ketchup was not Greek.  It was a joke but it came off a bit snobby.  The food was great but I think I'll stick with the midtown location since the service seemed better there.",0
"I was really disappointed with my meal at XYST. The flavors were totally off and the food was tasteless. The amaretto on the Old Fashioned was terrible, and I couldn't taste anything else. The truffle cheese crostini was also bland. The carrots were also disappointing - they were mushy. The cauliflower and mushrooms were terrible too. The only thing that was decent was the pizza. Overall, I would not recommend XYST.",1
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The bar was big and comfortable, and the decor was very stylish and sophisticated. The majority of the patrons there were still in their work attire, and it was clear that they needed a drink to end their long day. The bartender was very sweet and greeted me right away. I ordered the Mac and cheese, which was delicious - a little too creamy for my taste, but still delicious. I wasn't going to have dessert, until I saw the sticky toffee pudding on the menu. Who doesn't love sticky toffee pudding? I had to have it, and the presentation was great - they poured flambé caramel sauce over it when they brought it out. The cake, unfortunately, had big pieces of dates or figs, which I didn't like, but overall the experience was great. I will definitely be back!",1
"We had a great time at Bazar Tapas! The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating, which is really cool. We ordered a variety of delicious bites and the mussels, pan con tomate, patatas bravas (no tapas meal is complete without these), bone marrow, and the paella del mar were all amazing. I was a bit surprised that the patatas bravas was served with cheese, but I loved it! The French 77 that I ordered was perfect tart and refreshing. We also enjoyed the atmosphere and cocktails at Bazar. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend it to others!",1
"We saw some reservations open up this morning so jumped on the opportunity to try out Madison pickle. We were big fans of jacobs pickle so it was a no brainer. We ordered a ton of food just because we needed to try a little of everything. The pull apart bread was just divine, if you are looking for savory that's the option for ya. The deviled eggs were pretty good, massive, but I believe jacobs pickles have better ones. The Mac and cheese is a must have, I've had the Buffalo Mac before and it was incredible. The original is just as good and even the small portion is enough for 2. The French dip deluxe was probably the best French did I've ever had. The flavor and the tenderness of the beef was just perfect. That's the highlight for me and I'd come back just for one of those. The French toast with hot honey chicken was also out of this world. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I'd dare say some of the best fried chicken around. Super tender and juicy. All and all I believe this spot is better than jacobs pickles but I'd be completely happy going to either one! One of my favorite NYC spots for sure!",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The hot pot is really delicious, and the a la carte ingredients are really fresh and delicious. The service is also really attentive and not overbearing for our group of three. The decor and all the wooden serving bowls and baskets etc. are also really nice touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The food was amazing and the space was beautiful. The only downside is that the prices are a bit on the higher side, but I thought it was worth it overall. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I'm not a soup fanatic however there are some creamy soups that I love such as Loaded Baked Potato Soup, Lobster Bisque, and New England Clam Chowder.My Hunny picked me up a large Lobster Bisque soup to accommodate my diet. My meal came with an apple, bread, and a Lindt Milk Chocolate ball. I couldn't believe that my soup was considered a large. The container was awfully small. Albeit the soup was good, I've had better. I'd definitely pass on the extra side of sodium included. After each bite I found myself getting thirstier and thirstier. Soup shouldn't taste processed. I would've appreciated if the consistency was less watery and on the thicker side. Also the soup to lobster ratio was off.",0
"I was so unimpressed with Obao that I wasted my meal in NYC. The food was seriously mediocre, and the interior is not as pretty as the photos. The servers were not rude, but they were not sweet either. Additionally, I needed to use a charger, and I saw that they had chargers but asked if we could use a charger and they said they don't have any. (Why lie to us?) I was just annoyed that the food was mediocre though. We had pho bo (apparently Michelin recommended but seriously not tasty), beef cubes, papaya salad, and ribs. The ribs with sweet and sour sauce were the only ones we thought were good. Maybe I picked the wrong dishes, but I would not waste a meal here if you're traveling like me.",1
"It was exactly what I expected ~ an Irish pub.  They will count down the last few seconds with you to get to the 4 o'clock happy hour.  Went in for an adult beverage and ended up staying and having dinner.  No complaints.  We had multiple servers frequently checking on us that we did not need anything ~ be it liquid or solid.  It is bar food ~ not trying to be anything fancy.  I will say that I totally enjoyed the nachos.  It is decorated for the holidays and felt very welcoming to me.  We were greeted promptly, no attitudes here.  They were even open on Thanksgiving Day to enjoy a beverage before heading out for our dinner.  I do believe they were offering turkey, but we had reservations elsewhere.  We left as happy customers.",0
"Came here during happy hour on a Friday and were able to sit outside immediately, wasn't too packed yet! Ordered some drinks, my friends enjoyed their cocktail, my Guinness was good, a bit more foam than I'd like though. The burger and fries were good, a nice time but didn't blow me away. One male server (probably the owner) was very sweet and attentive, props to him for running an overall nice business",0
"I found my new favorite restaurant! Red Rooster is a great mix of a mature crowd, excellent food, and great music. I can't say enough good things about it. My favorites are the wings, the crab cakes, and the cornbread. It can be a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it for all the great amenities, like access to meet movers & shakers, and professional vibe.",1
"I ordered two slices and they gave them to cold so I asked if they could warm them up a bit more. Then they forgot about them, which resulted in them being burnt. I asked if I could have two new slices given they have given me black cardboard and then they proceeded to give me two cold slices. I don't think it's a lot to ask for two warm pizza slices but they can't even deliver that. Better places in NY to get a hot slice without attitude",0
"I came here a couple times since my first experience and had positive experiences. I've grown to love Zuma - esp the Miami location. I came in last night-I didn't like that they tried to seat me by the counter given I had a reservation in advance. I think that should be better communicated. I felt the host could have been kinder to me. I spoke to the manager Dina- she was able to get us a table with better seating, but we had to wait by the bar first. She was kind and came found us once the table was ready. The night turned around once we sat in a comfortable spot- Joe our waiter was kind and helpful. My fav things on the menu are the cold dishes- hamachi etc. I also enjoy the cooked fish dishes- sea bass/cod. The rice pot is nice aswell. I don't have a particular favorite- most of the menu is up my flavor pallet just depends on the day. Nice ambiance, DJ good music.",0
I recently visited this restaurant and was disappointed by the poor quality of their liquor. I ordered a grand margarita and was given triple sec instead. I was also disappointed that the restaurant didn't seem to know what a grand margarita was supposed to taste like.,1
"I had a really great time at Daniel. The amuse bouche was really tasty, and I can't remember all of the ingredients, but it was definitely something special. The Foie Gras terrine was definitely one of the highlights of the meal - the sumac really added a unique flavor. The bread was amazing, and the olive oil was a nice touch.

The scharbauer Ranch Beef was definitely a standout dish - it was cooked perfectly and was definitely a must-try. The only downside was the pomme savonnette - it was a bit too firm and cold for my taste. The apricot dessert was also decent, but I'll try something different next time.

The service was great, and the sommelier was very engaging and warm. Overall, I thought the meal was fantastic and would definitely recommend it to others. I would definitely go back again!",1
I had a great Sunday lunch with a friend at this restaurant. The service was attentive and we had our banchan and sauces refilled when empty. The atmosphere was cozy and the food was delicious. I didn't leave smelling too much of meat so the ventilation was pretty good. I will definitely be back!,1
"I'm so glad I found this new happy hour spot! The outdoor seating is perfect for summer weather and the staff is so attentive and friendly. I love the food and drinks options - $4 beer and food options are great! The staff was great too - they were attentive at refilling water and asking if we needed anything. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
Got 2 tacos as a quick bite here and honestly wish I got 6 they were so delicious. Got 1 pork and 1 steak and would recommend both. Will need to try the chicken and cactus tacos next time. Would definitely come back!,0
"A little overpriced but reasonable for the area. The fried pork belly with vermicelli was my favorite and came with a good amount of greens and lettuce. The curry noodle soup was good but a bit too oily. I would come back if I wanted Laotian food in particular, but nothing really stood out to me. Service was quick, and there were plenty of tables for a weekday dinner.",0
"Happened to walk by on a late Sunday afternoon and saw some open tables outside. Decided to try our luck and we were seated woo. The setup outside is lovely and perfect for people watching. I started with a glass of rose and the person who poured literally gave me like 3 sips for $15 glass hmmm, not a great start. I'd rather they use the small carafes than eyeball it if she's going to skimp on the pour. We then decided to try some pastas. The garganelli with mushroom ragu was lovely, lots of mushroom forward flavors so great if you love that. It did come topped with tons of ricotta which overpowered the dish a bit. I tried the tagliatelle and it was fine but I honestly prefer my Bolognese more traditional and simple. This one had a lot of flavors and was on the saltier side. Service was attentive and food came out fast. Overall it was just fine for me. The food was good but spending $100 for 2 for a casual lunch should be more than good.",0
"I've been here two times, but last night solidified my love for Gammeeok. I came here with my friend and the host told me it would be 15 minutes. You know when somebody in the city tells you it's a 15 minute wait, it's usually 30+ minutes. But true to the host's word, we actually got seated in 15 minutes! Unheard of. I only order selleongtang when I come here, but I will say they always bring out the order so fast.  The selleongtang is so worth it at only $12 a bowl and is sooo filling because of the rice and noodles in the soup. The only banchan they give is kimchi but the thick cuts of kimchi radish are delicious!",0
"Yummy and affordable Filipino food in Upper East Side. The menu has a variety of dishes to choose and pretty affordable. The food is very well-seasoned. Sisig is so good, highly recommend. The bulalo has a little sourness, while the kare kare has a very strong peanut butter taste. The vegetable dish is creamy from the coconut milk.",0
"The pho here is pretty good, and the price is reasonable. The spring rolls are also a big hit - they're crispy on the outside and have a tasty filling.",1
"I honestly was hovering between a 4 and a 5 so my rating is actually a 4.5. I enjoyed the food but my friends and I did think it was salty, so I don't recommend this to anyone with sodium restrictions. The food came to the table steaming hot and quickly. Plus, it's halal! It seems tough to find halal food outside of burgers and fried chicken sometimes but Jiang's delivers a welcome change. The food is very savory and we asked for some of it to be spicy and it was. We order the baked lamb bun, diced crispy chicken w/crispy red pepper (in mild & spicy), steamed lamb shumai, sizzling rice w/cumin flavor (with beef or lamb but I can't remember which), fried noodles w/spicy minced beef, the stewed lamb ribs, and the egg tomato sliced dough noodle soup. I'm not a huge red meat eater but the lamb ribs were delectable and just fell off the bone. I would definitely order again! I enjoyed everything overall though. The sizzling rice and the soup were both very comforting. The crispy chicken (spicy version) also hit my craving for something crunchy really well! The restaurant was also clean and had space for our large party.",0
"This restaurant was great! The food was fantastic and the staff was very attentive. The only downside was that it was a bit stuffy in the restaurant. But overall, I would definitely recommend it.",1
"You expect a good salad when you go to Just Salad...and even pretty good service as you go down the line choosing what you want. But I'm here to extol the virtues of the staff watching the online ordering. I ordered in advance and saw there would be at least a 15 minute wait. But when I got there early, a staff member noticed I was standing around and waiting, she asked for my name and made sure the salad was made promptly to get me out the door. That's service...and that's must appreciated!(FYI, I got the Autumn Ceaser, and it was great!)",0
"I visited Bilao Filipino Cuisine and was very pleased with the food. The registered nurses who opened the restaurant during the pandemic have done a great job of creating a restaurant that is popular with locals and visitors alike. I especially enjoyed the lumpiang shainghai - the pork eggrolls. They are best eaten fresh, and I was able to get a few before they were all gone. The pata or pork was also very good, and the portions were large. I would definitely recommend Bilao to others. The restaurant was able to serve us takeout in about 30 minutes for only $70.",1
I had a great experience at Yunshang! The food was filling and the prices were reasonable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.,1
"Restaurant week dinner 2019 ($42)Appetizer: Mushroom Soup with whipped fresh cream - a larger portion than I expected, I loved that.Main: Loup de Mer (sea bass) Dessert: Tarte Au Pamplemousse (grapefruit tarte + sorbet) - really good, but got too sweet for me - Near Lincoln Center- Classy ambiance- Perfect location for any occasion",0
"I was excited to try Zen Pot, but unfortunately my experience was not great. The restaurant is ""virtual"" and located inside another Chinese restaurant, so you'll have to order online through apps. Unfortunately, I ran into some problems with this. I had to order thru a third party delivery platform because the QR ordering code led to a spam website. The food came out quick, but the number of varieties in each bowl was rather limited/small. The flavor was good, but the medium spicy was not spicy to me (lots of oil). However, the beef was better compared to the shrimp. I really thought it would be a lot better if this was a dish offered at a real restaurant.",1
"thai restaurant with very modern decor, staffs wears thai style uniform and offers good lunch menu options. came with a party of 6 during lunch time just when it first opened and the restaurant quickly filled out afterwards. Overall a pleasant experience and would come back.",0
"The brunch at this restaurant was okay. The appearance was cute with the foam art, but 2/3 of the cappuccinos were cold. The best part of the brunch were the excellent poached eggs, which were perfectly cooked - 5/5 stars. However, the bacon was so incredibly salty that it was difficult for me to eat. My friend requested salt for her poached eggs and 10 minutes later, the waitress apologized for completely forgetting. Overall, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant.",1
"Miss Lily's is a great place to go for a delicious meal. However, I had a bad experience there three years ago and haven't returned since. I left my shopping bag there and they never bothered to put it in the back for me. I was really disappointed when I finally arrived the next day and found that the bag was missing.",1
"Great Thai Food, sooo tasty too!I love Thai Food and its exotic flavors.  I ordered the Pra Ram with Tofu and rice and OMG it was so delicious I even finished the entire dish!  Also, their passion fruit mojito is really good and refreshing and enjoyable.  We got there around 6:30pm so there wasn't really a wait line and we got our tables right away, we did not wait.  Given that I'm a little claustrophobic (just a little bit), the place is small and the tables are way too close to each other it feels more of like a family dinner than a private one lol.  No big deal, the food made it all worth it. The place is small but very cozy and it has a warm environment.  It is nicely decorated but again too crowded.  By the time we were done, the entrance was very crowded it could seem like a journey to reach the exit door.  Other than that it is a great place to eat!  Again the food is good and I recommend!",0
appreciate the contemporary take on ramen. good memories kicking back here for a casual lunch with co-workers. friendly staff.,0
"Came here for restaurant week a while back with coworkers.The food here was colorful and definitely aesthetics. It actually tasted pretty good too. The restaurant week was a prix fixe. I thought the food was good but slightly on the oily side. The price was a little high though. The environment was fancy, I think this turns into a club at night.",0
Love pho but this place is not like the kind I remember in Vietnam. I got the short rib pho and the broth tasted alittle too sour before adding any lime. The bowl is definitely giant and you will be full all day. I couldn't finish the noodles. The pho is rated 3 stars. However the duck roll is the star of the show. Highly rated 5 stars. Could eat them all day with the  tasty Hoisin sauce. Good service and fast take out.,0
"It was a rainy night and we were craving Indian, so we looked up delivery spots somewhat close by. I am SO glad this came up. Pippali ""delivered"" on all counts and I cannot wait to order from them again.We got the chicken tikka masala prix fixe, which comes with an appetizer, naan, and basmati rice. And we also got the beetroot dumplings prix fixe. We got the samosas and a chicken-mint dish as our appetizers. The beetroot dumplings are incredible! What! How is that a veggie? Two pillowy delicious morsels of veggies totally wowed me in this sweet and savory sauce that I've never tasted before. This is a surprising must get. Also loved their chicken tikka masala which is also sweet and savory and sumptuous and rich and all the things you want in a masala. The two appetizers didn't wow me as much but the entrees themselves were incredible.And the naan! They're like two massive pancakes but without the butter and maple syrup! So doughy and fluffy and slightly slightly sweet. I even at some of them plain, they are that good. 5 stars!!!!!!",0
The meat on the Philly cheesesteak sandwich was undercooked and full of fat. Very unappealing. The Caesar salad was decent. Not a place I would recommend or return to.,0
"I had great hopes for this place since I love Caribbean food and thought this was just as pumped up as TikTok and Instagram shows, but it's far from that. The cramped atmosphere made it difficult to enjoy the meal, but their food was delicious. The shrimp double tacos were my favorite, but the service was terrible. Our server didn't know how to take orders, and took a long time to bring our drinks, after our entrees had arrived. The 18% tip we left was a waste, as our service was poor overall. I would not recommend this restaurant, as Miss Lily's 7A Cafe in the West Village is much better.",1
"Passed by this new restaurant and thought we'll give it a try. The interior looks very cozy but it was full and we were unable to get a table so we order a couple of dishes to try another day when we were in the area. As most of the yelpers noted it's unauthentic, not even worth a try if you are curious - and if you do try you will most likely be disappointed.We ordered two items to taste and will not return:1. sweet and sour ribs - no comment just look at the picture. A beginner cook could do a better job. Taste bad. If you are planning to order this I suggest you donate the $15 to charity.2. Fish - Again donate the $20+ if you are planning to order this- it taste so bad and bitter- can't eat this. A beginner chef would do a better job.Hope the restaurant improve and customers order at their own risk.",0
I had a great time at this quaint Chinatown restaurant. The service was surprisingly good and the food was very affordable and filling. I ordered a beef tendon/ brisket noodle with bits of stewed daikon. It reminded me of my childhood and how my mom used to make it. I also had a rice noodle roll with peanut sauce. I recommend it if you're a fan of peanuts or peanut butter.,1
"AYCE mussels and fries + one beer = a Belgium meal. They don't advertise this but this deal is only on Sunday and Mondays. It's $27/person, if I remember correctly, or if prices haven't changed. Not a bad deal at all! There's about 5-6 different flavors of mussels you can choose from. You're given a bowl of fries while you wait for your first pot of mussels. First pot always comes out filled to the top. By your second order, the amount of mussels are already halved in portion. My favorite is the thai base. I usually get to the third pot and I'm done. Service is good here too. They don't try to rush you or guilt you into ordering less. I always leave satisfied!",0
"Don't believe the hype, pictures from social media are not accurate , food is horrible and service is pushy. Sushi lab has been on my bookmarks for awhile and it was a huge disappointment. I have no qualms with non-Japanese owned omakase places but the sushi that is served here is a disgrace to the cuisine. After going through an odd maze and walking up a flight of stairs to get to this rooftop, I noticed how the fake  floral decorations weren't as pretty in real life.  We originally were seated at the sushi bar but after a few minutes of listening and (obviously understanding)the workers gossip in Chinese we asked to be switched to a table top to enjoy our meal without distraction. For the $100 tasting menu I didn't enjoy anything. First off, the sushi rice was horrific. It was wet and too vinegary, real low grade sushi rice. Next, all the ""pieces"" were either too sweet or too fishy tasting... the omakase menu claimed to have truffle so imagine my surprise when a tuna sushi was brought out with fake generic truffle shavings ... the Uni soba was a joke too ... two small pieces of cheap Uni in a simple soba with sauce ... an 8year old could've made it . Don't even get me started on the forgettable wagyu and foiegras piece. The service was mediocre, in that they did come and pour our sake now and then and introduce in a rushed manner what each piece was but before 10pm, the waitress threw our check into our table and the other staff kept coming by to see if we paid yet. Will not be back",0
"Came here for a quick drinks with a colleague during their happy hour. Not the greatest happy hour prices but it was a pretty convenient spot. Ordered a couple of beers and appetizers. The chicken wings were delicious and I will gladly come back here again for the chicken wings. Service was good, the waiter was really attentive and friendly.",0
"Usually not a big fan of French food, but decided to give GK a try since my friend raved about it. We opted for the pre fixe menu as we wanted to order all different things and try as much of their menu as we could. The bread at the beginning was amazing. I love bread and theirs was so flavorful and went so well with the spread. I probably asked for extra bread 4 or 5 times. The main, protein courses were great. Cooked well and enjoyed it although the portions were quite large and hard to finish. Moving onto the dessert - quite large and definitely on the sweet end. I definitely enjoy sweets but don't like overly sweet stuff. I think it was quite hard to finish toward the end. We felt super full afterward - not sure if it's just us though or if it's because it's quite heavy for our tastes, but we did notice that we would be SO full after eating at French restaurants (except atelier crenn). Overall, not bad - definitely one of the better French restaurants I've been to but still just not my taste.",0
"Smith & Wollensky is a great place for a date night, or to go with friends. The food is amazing, and the service is great. The only downside is that the outdoor space is not very appealing.",1
"O'Hara's Restaurant and Pub is a fun local place that you have to be ok with close seating. The food was good, and the place was kinda cool to see all the patches on the walls.",1
"The overuse of ponzu sauce was so evident in their Trust Me set. I would have been perfectly fine if they only placed ponzu sauce on the tuna sashimi but then they used it for several other pieces. Only the salmon sushi, toro handroll, and crab hand roll were good. Not sure if this set is worth the $40 price tag, but there's no tipping at the end of the meal. I really enjoyed the warm sushi rice...if only it didn't break apart so easily.",0
"Jajaja is a beautiful restaurant with delicious food! I would definitely visit this place for a fun date, friend gathering, or co-worker outing. Plus, there's a full bar! However, caution is warranted due to the restaurant not accepting cash as a form of payment. The horchatas and gorditas were both good, but the almond horchata was my favorite. The jackfruit tamale was an interesting dish, but I wasn't a fan. The nachos were delicious and definitely hit the spot. I'm looking forward to returning soon!",1
"I visited Ootoya in New York City for the first time last year and loved the experience - no tipping is a great concept. The dishes are a bit pricey, but with COVID, no-tipping is currently on hold. This made the food prices more expensive, but the food was still delicious. We ordered the sukiyaki nabe and the katsu ju for the mains. The sukiyaki is good - it's sweet and savory, but almost too sweet. The dinner order doesn't come with rice included unfortunately but we made do with the rice from the katsu ju. The katsu ju is basically oyakodon with tonkatsu - this is probably my favorite dish from Ootoya - seeet caramelized onions with eggs and tonkatsu. Some of the meat pieces are a little on the fattier side. There is something new called crispy rice sushi that I would advise being cautious with getting. It is not worth it in my opinion - the crispy rice is the top layer of the sushi rice, and tastes like what you think it would - almost like rice crispies, but with a toasty taste. But it's a strong taste and it totally takes away from enjoying the taste of the",1
"I discovered this restaurant when looking for desserts and wine after dinner nearby. Definitely want to come back for dinner. The menu looks great and the inside is beautiful. Our party of 5 sat in one of the outdoor booths.3 of us each chose a different wine, each of us was very happy with our selection. We shared the opera cake and the apple tarte tatin sundae and had trouble finishing it all. Both desserts are a great size to share for multiple people. The staff is friendly and attentive and our waiter gave perfect suggestions for dessert wine.",1
"Overall, Winter Beer and I had a decent time at this restaurant. The service was a bit slow, but it was understandable given the busyness of the restaurant. The food was good, with the exception of the dessert which was unfortunately not up to par. The churros were a particular letdown, but the chicken tenders were a big hit. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I was excited to try Pisillo, but my experience was not great. The sandwiches are quite expensive for what you get, and the bread is quite tough. The sandwich also had a strong sour flavor. I would not recommend this place.",1
"I ordered this on NYE through DoorDash.  I ordered the chicken lils, which is chicken sliders (really just a cutlet cut in half), with pickles, mayo, and whatever ""holy sauce"" is.  The chicken was under-seasoned and uninspired, the buns were not toasted well.  I got fries, which were soggy (probably not their fault, probably due to delivery).I'm not sure what type of place this actually is, or the origin of the name (they do have schnitzel, but doesn't seem a focus point).  They have random selections like hummus platter, cornflake chicken fingers, various chicken dishes/wraps/sandwiches.  They have burgers, pulled beef, pastrami and pepper steak sandwiches.There is probably a concept I'm missing with this place, and I'll look into it more, but at this point, it's a ""Jack of all trades, master of none,"" and there is nothing I see to pull me back to try more.",0
"Chicken cutlet, and food similar to it, has become one of my favorite foods. And much like my quest to find good Mexican food, I am also in a quest to find the good places that serve cutlet style chicken sandwiches and wraps.Unfortunately, Holy Schnitzel did not live up to my expectations. Their listing on UberEats shows their namesake sandwich packed with generous portions of chicken. But reality gave a different experience.The chicken portions were ridiculously small. Even the vegetables and dressing came in very small portions.This place turned out to be a tremendous disappointment. I will never buy anything from here again. I hope they change their business practices, or get pushed to the dirt by the better options that inhabit the Manhattan area.",0
"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe of this restaurant - it was definitely a great place to eat! However, the food wasn't as great as I had hoped. The sausage pizza was pretty disappointing - there wasn't much sausage on it, and it was covered in arugula. My friends and I also ordered fries and Brussels sprouts as our side dish, and those were both good. The Brussels sprouts were definitely the best thing we had. Overall, I thought the restaurant was good, but I wouldn't recommend it for food.",1
"Came here for a friend's birthday and made reservations ahead of time. We were seating promptly and service is very friendly!I think it is pretty pricey for the quantity and quality. I got the hakkido kaisen (basically raw fish over rice- kind of like a poke bowl)- it was $35. I feel like for $35 I would get more fish at other places. It was a pretty small portion. My friend got the uni pasta, risotto, ramen salad, and fried chicken. The fried chicken came with 4 decent sized pieces. They said the ramen salad and uni pasta were pretty good. Portions are not that large so if you are hungry you should prob order a few more dishes. For drinks I got the oolong Hi - it was not very good so I would not recommend this. I think the place is decent but the portions just are on the smaller side and not satisfying.",0
"I went here a little while ago with a group of friends for orthodox Christmas and we had a great time. While we relied on the Russians in our group to order, I enjoyed everything that was put on the table. The food was rich, well priced, and came out quickly. The drinks were strong and tasted good. The only complaint I have is that this random girl (not staff) from the bar kept coming to our table and we clearly were just being polite and didn't want to talk to her but the staff did nothing and didn't kick her out despite multiple tables having this incident with her. However I know that isn't a common occurrence.",0
"Two Hands is a great cafe with beautiful millennial decor, nice staff and open kitchen view. The flavor was a bit too overload for my taste, but the cafe is extremely busy so that may just be because of the popularity. The staff were great and accommodating, letting a family of four sit outside when they closed the patio due to staff shortage. The cafe is also very clean and priced well. I would recommend Two Hands to others.",1
"I came here on my last visit to New York, I was with a group of 10+ and it was difficult finding a restaurant that would take reservations to accommodate. Bocca di Bacco Hell's Kitchen was one of the few restaurants that offered us this option. We were seated about 15 minutes after our reserved time due to another party taking longer to close out their table.Staff were friendly, handed us menus and gave our group some suggestions. As a table we ordered several appetizers, the most memorable appetizer was an item that was not on the menu, but suggested by the waiter, Special Appetizer which came with Burrata, Tomatoes and Prosciutto. The cheese was so creamy and flavorful. For my entree I went with the suggestion of our waiter as well for the Special Pasta. This came with Lobster, Clams and Squid Ink Pasta. I was not a huge fan of my entree... the sauce came out diluted and the pasta had a chewy, gummy texture. I would stick to the other more traditional dishes, I had a taste of several other dishes around the table and the sauces and pasta were alot better... the Orecchiette with Sausage was really good!Overall I would suggest this spot to accommodate large parties. The food was decent, but not amazing. The price point is average and portions are plentiful so if I were in the area again with another large group I would return :)",0
"This was such a hit and miss restaurant that I was disappointed about.  I must say, the burrata is amazing - very creamy, and the real truffle just blew me away.  The brussel sprouts were were alright, but lacked flavor.  I was most disappointed by the pizza.  I made my own pizza with prosciutto, mozarella, ricotta, and arugula, and it came out extremely soggy to the point where I couldn't tell if I was eating the crust or mozzarella cheese.  The waiter claimed it was because of the ricotta cheese but I've had other pizzas with ricotta on it that hold its shape.  Combined with the fact that there was also barely any prosciutto, it was definitely not worth the $30+ I paid for it.",0
"I had a great time at Barn Joo 35 last Saturday lunchtime! The service was great and the food was even better. Our server was very helpful and answered all of our questions about the dishes, and made sure to keep an eye on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. The hot pot is definitely enough for 2-3 people to share, and the truffle fries were a delicious addition. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and stress-free lunch.",1
"We were so happy to find this restaurant in our neighborhood! The food is delicious and affordable, and the portions are really filling. We ordered a rice roll in a takeout container and it was surprisingly filling. The rice sheet itself is really pliable and a great vehicle for the egg, other protein, and veggie fillings. The soy dipping sauce (more like pouring sauce) is essential. We preferred the shrimp party (1 big shrimp per segment, plus the little dried shrimpies!) but the steamed beef and pork work pretty well too. The staff is super friendly and we'll definitely be back!",1
"I rarely give 1 star reviews, but this food was just bad. It was incredibly bland and not very well cooked. The person I shared this meal with thought the same.",0
"I visited Thai Villa for a quick lunch while on a work trip and was really pleased with the food. The wait to eat inside was a bit long, but the street shelter was really warm and pleasant. The food was great - I'll definitely be looking to make a reservation next time I'm in town!",1
"This maybe my new favorite Thai delivery spot. I tried the Tom Kha Soup and Kao Soi Noodle with vegetables, both delicious. Generous quantity, certainly enough for 2+ meals. I'll be ordering again for sure!",0
"I had the pleasure of trying Prince Street Pizza for the first time and I was not disappointed! The pizza is unbelievably fluffly and light, with a delicious smoky, juicy and meaty flavor. The food goes down easy, making it the perfect meal for any time of the day. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious and convenient pizza fix.",1
"I know they are closed right now due to a structural problem.......great little spot if you live in this neighborhood or are at the Pier for an event.a/c was not working when were there on a HOT HUMID 90F evening...ouch, ,so we opted for outside......Food was terrific.....loved the pate and the gazpacho.....mussels were fantastic, as was the smoked salmon tartine!  I had a double order.....the carrot margarita was amazing and the servers were LOVELY!!!A nice little surprise....hope they can reopen soon.    Hard enough with Covid to keep it going.",0
Yummy and quick delivery. A little different from some other spots in that the noodles are thin. Also recommend the spring rolls and Thai iced tea.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ordering was fast and the food came quickly, too. The dishes were cooked perfectly, but my hot stone bowl wasn't as spicy as I would've liked it to be. However, the army stew they replaced the spam with was delicious. I would definitely come back here whenever I'm in the area!",1
"I stopped by The Bagel Basket for lunch and it was a great experience! The staff was super friendly and the food was great. The portions were also generous, which was a nice touch. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious breakfast or lunch.",1
"With so much hype surrounding this place, I definitely went in with lofty expectations. I will say that for the most part, Ichiran meets the hype but I don't think it's ""worth"" the hype. Let me explain. The soup broth is excellent. Obviously the soup is customiz-able so that obviously bodes well for the restaurant meeting customers' different palates, but you can tell the base is really solid. Unfortunately, while the menu allows for a ton of customization, I have yet to really see a difference between the different broths you can get. I've gone four times and even when I have selected different levels of richness, spice, etc, the broths tasted the same. I thought the lack of spice was really disappointing as Totto and Ippudo's spicy ramens have a far better kick to them. While the ramen overall was really good, I didn't find myself blown away by it either. I definitely crave Totto Ramen from time to time, but I don't have the same feeling for this ramen. The biggest turnoff to this place is definitely the price. It honestly feels like this restaurant is hoping to feast on tourists for as long as it's around because I can't imagine NYC natives to come here on a regular basis...although NYC natives are less sensitive to higher price points than most. $19 for BASIC ramen (soup, noodles, scallions) with JUST two small pieces of pork is outrageous. You have to pay $5 more for the standard ramen toppings such as an egg (which you have to peel yourself...lame), mushrooms, seaweed, etc. Even the other ramen rivals charge like 33% less. Unfortunately, since I am somewhat of a bargain-hunter when it comes to food, I probably won't be coming here anytime soon but if you can bear the expense, I would check this place out.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this ramen shop. It's great to go eat alone and enjoy a bowl of ramen. The line wasn't too long and I was able to get a seat without waiting in line. The barriers to block the view of people next to me made it nice and peaceful to enjoy my meal. The water is self serve so you would have to make some interactions with people to get to the water refilling machine but it's really close by so it wasn't a concern. I ordered the recommended combo on the menu with a side of rice. The price was around $27, but note that it is close to Times Square so it may be a bit overpriced. Everything on the menu was delicious, even the pork meat slices. When I finished the toppings/noodles/ meat I had enough broth to order additional noodles but as I noted above I already ordered a side of rice so that was more than enough to finish the rest of the broth. When you're done, you press a button and a server will give you a number to take to the front of the restaurant to pay for your meal. Overall, I had a great experience at this ramen shop and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
I had a great time at Roti Canai! The appetizer was tasty and shareable. The ultimate curry laksa was my favorite dish. It was flavorful and the noodles were made just right. The fish balls with tofu and cucumber added more deliciousness to the dish. I would definitely recommend coming here!,1
"I had a good time at Raku, and their interior space did a great job of conveying the Japanese vibes. The udon noodles weren't the sanuki type I was expecting, but they were still good. The yamakake wasn't very flavorful, and the egg was pretty small. I'll probably try their hot udon next time since this one is a little less intense.",1
"I had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The food was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend trying everything on the menu, as I'm sure you'll love it. The curries are especially vegetarian-friendly and are really delicious. The only downside is that it can get quite busy, so be prepared to wait a bit. The atmosphere is really nice too - it's well decorated and has a nice vibe.",1
"I thought the food was definitely above average. When you check in on Yelp, you get a free fruit tea!

We came here after we failed to grab a spot at our favorite udon place. Then afterwards, we decided to dine at a place with an outdoor space that's covered.Thankfully they had one, though placed on the street. We weren't too keen on the slowness initially. We weren't seated until later because no one was at the host stand. And because they had a bunch of pick-ups, we weren't served in a timely manner.

Though afterwards, (I'm guessing after the dinner rush) we got more prompt service. We ordered some Xiao Long Bao which were really good and also the sticky rice siu mai are just what my boyfriend is looking for. I also ordered the duck which was a bit too cold for my taste and the Shanghai noodles would have been really good, but sitting outside made the food get cold really quickly.

Overall I really liked the food, but could have been better! Definitely one of the more authentic restaurants.",1
SUPER overpriced for the amount of food you got and the tables are on top of each other.  Also the woman who bussed the tables had a very long braid that kept hitting us every time she would clear a table which was soo gross.  I have wanted to eat here for a long time but I won't go back,0
"I had a great experience at Mexicue Bryant Park, so I decided to try out the Nomad location. I was definitely not disappointed! I ordered the fried avocado taco and the seasonal: Spicy Smoky Wild Mushroom taco. The fried avocado taco was really good - and I loved the seasoning on it. The seasonal one wasn't as great, but I still enjoyed it. I also stayed at my table for 1.5 hours after I ate my tacos - which is rare for me. The service was great, too. The waiter was friendly and quick. I would definitely recommend Mexicue - and I think I'll be back to try out some of the other dishes!",1
"Chinah's is a restaurant that I've stopped by a few times and overall, the food is pretty good. This time, I ordered a bowl with forbidden black rice as the base, baby bok choy for the greens, home style eggplant for the side, and homemade meatballs for the main. The black rice was well cooked - soft but with a slight bite to it. I think I prefer white rice since it has a more neutral flavor but the black rice has a nuttiness to it that is unique and was still enjoyable.

The eggplant was cooked with bamboo shoots, carrots, and wood ear mushrooms in a thick sauce that was slightly sweet and tangy. On the menu, it said it was spicy but there is barely any heat from the eggplant.

The bok choy was unfortunately super over cooked. They were brownish green (due to being over cooked) and soggy, which was disappointing :(

The bowl came with three large meatballs (around the size of a tennis ball). These meatballs were super tender and juicy and tasted like five spice, a classic Chinese flavor :)

Finally, the toppings - the fried onion + garlic add a great crunch to the bowl and",1
so i was super excited to try this place for awhile and bloop it came up on meal pal.got it for lunch today.walked in one guy was working and he looked miserable and didn't acknowledge  anyone and people were waiting and waiting for awhile it looked like cause they asked where food was.i finally got my food as so excited bite into the dumpling and thus weird paper like thing is in there and i have been eating dumplings forever never had this happen so guess that's going trash...,0
"Someone recommended this as a super fun dinner for kids. I booked it online and then checked the Yelp reviews (big mistake to not check before booking). Unfortunately, it was too late to cancel this non refundable reservation so we decided to try it. It turns out yelpers, as usual, are right- skip this one. They get points for trying with all the spookiness and theatrics, but the food  was no better than Mickey Ds and it was incredibly cheesy. I will say the staff was all very nice and helpful so they get another star for that. It also had a mildew smell throughout and while our table was clean enough, the bathroom (hidden behind a secret bookshelf) could use a good scrubbing. My daughter thought it was kind of fun, but pretty sure if I brought my younger boys here they'd be scared and running out the door within minutes. Definitely a unique experience, but not for me.",0
"I ordered a pizza from this place at 2 AM and it was delicious! I will have to come back during the day to give a more accurate review, but for now, I'd say it's definitely worth a try!",1
"I recently visited this restaurant late at night and was really impressed. The quality of food was always great, and the pepperoni was especially amazing. I also really enjoyed the one mushroomy slice I had. The slices were decently sized and nicely crispy, with a good amount of toppings. Overall, this is an excellent place to get a delicious meal late at night.",1
"I am a huge KBBQ lover, so I was very excited to try Let's Meat. We got the Classic $40 set and ordered pork belly, pork jowl, and brisket. For AYCE KBBQ, the meat was pretty good quality. I was happy with what we got. Sadly, however, I think if I am spending $40+ per person for KBBQ there are a few other places that are better options. Usually when I go out for KBBQ, it is also $40-50 a person, yet the meat quality and side dishes are better. I suppose if you are eating a LOT, then it would be worth. I also love a steamed egg with my KBBQ, and Let's Meat did not have any :(The 12-3 lunch option was around $27, so I think that is extremely worth! I would definitely come back here during lunch time for that deal. Otherwise, I would probably stick to other KBBQ restaurants.",0
"Baker Street Pub had reopened! The pandemic closed them temporarily but they survived and  look better than ever. Good spot to watch a game, gather with friends, and enjoy a pint. World Cup Soccer viewing is a mainstay here.",0
"Felice 64 is a great Italian restaurant that I would highly recommend. The service was great and the food was delicious. My only complaint is that the appetizer I ordered had cabbage in it, which I didn't enjoy. Otherwise, everything else was great. I would give Felice 64 a 4.5 out of 5.",1
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The cold dishes were so good! They serve complementary pickled vegetables and jasmine green tea in a pot! We ordered swing pork belly in garlic sauce, numbing chicken, and stew fish in chili oil! They were all soo good! The fish in chili oil was super spicy though, but it was a great combo with the other cold dishes! My bf loves spicy so he could handle it. I couldn't, so I dipped the fish in the numbing chicken sauce! It was absolutely life changing!!!!

The wait was always long, but it was totally worth it! I would definitely recommend coming ahead of time and putting your name on the waitlist, because they always have a long wait!",1
"The brunch at this restaurant was amazing! The drinks were light and refreshing, and the hot cakes were delicious. The Japanese shakshuka was also really good, and I was pleasantly surprised by the cauliflower in it. The nori fries were also great, with a good spicy mayo dip. I would definitely come back for dinner here, and recommend it to others as well.",1
"I had a great time at Buddha Bodai! The food was great and the outdoor seating was perfect. The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. I especially liked the barriers between the tables, it made it more private. The only downside was that they didn't have heat lamps in the winter.",1
"Perfect brunch spot.  Service was great and kept our coffee full, which is all I ask for when I'm eating brunch outside.  The corned beef hash is highly recommended. The sandwich was okay, I didn't really care for the bread.  We enjoyed our breakfast here and would recommend it.",0
"I was really excited to come back to New York because New York has Totto and Ippudo. We called ahead to ask this expansion spot how long the wait was and they said there wasn't one so we decided to give the expansion a spot. It was a mistake that I won't make again. The service at this place is so slow that even the delivery drivers were getting upset at wait times. While we were seated immediately, we didn't get our ramen for almost 45 minutes. And, when that ramen came out, the portions were smaller than the original, the meat quality for the mega paitan was tough, and the noodles weren't fully cooked. It even took us a long time to pay. Honestly, we could've just left and no one would have noticed, but even though the food was not quality stuff, and the wait time made no sense (compared to the crazy efficient original store that's always more packed than this), we would never dine and dash. We just wouldn't come back.",0
"Spanish diner is one of the restaurants in Little Spain at Hudson Yards, I love this place since they have retractable walls ready for dinner al fresco on nice weather.For mid-April, the weather that night was warm and we decided to be seated outdoors. Everything here is done electronically, you scan a code on the table for contact tracing, ordering food, and payment. We thought that it was a good concept since less interaction with restaurant staff. We ordered the following for Pica-pica paired with a nice bottle of Spanish Rosé:1. Pan con Tomate; crystal bread brushed with tomato and olive oil, we were debating whether to order full or half size it turned out that half order portion was more than enough for two people.2. Jamón Serrano 3. Queso ManchegoFor our main we decided for Spanish comfort food, we ordered Albondigas con Tomate y patatas fritas; Iberico pork meatballs with tomato sauce and fried tomatoes And pollo guisado con Arroz; chicken stewed in caramelized onions and sherry wine served with garlic rice. we enjoyed sharing both dishes, they are delicious. the chicken meat is falling from its bones that's how tender the chicken was. I also particularly enjoyed eating the meatballs with rice.We then concluded our dinner with Spanish flan with whip creme to share. since everything is contactless we even paid our bill electronically and simply just walked away from the restaurant. We genuinely had a wonderful dinner here. The ambiance was great with delicious food that came in a timely fashion. It will definitely not our last visit.",0
"The burger at this restaurant wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The staff was friendly and attentive, however, so I'd recommend stopping by for a drink if you're looking for a good time.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant, but unfortunately it just didn't work out for me. I ordered the chorizo chicken as recommended by a friend and found it to be the soggiest, saddest mess of a sandwich. I could barely muster more than a few bites even with napkins and utensils in tow. Didn't particularly like the sauce, either -- the smokiness and spice was a little too strong for my personal preference. It was also more expensive than expected -- nearly $20 for the sandwich, chips, and a drink I believe. Overall, I don't recommend, though I wouldn't be against giving this place another try for one of their other sandwiches.",1
"So good to be back at Van Da after a year of eating at home. The food, service and cocktails are as good as ever. Truly amazing Vietnamese cuisine.",0
"Was craving some Chinese food so decided to give Tri Dim a try. Server was very informative and friendly. Staff was super attentive in making sure my water cup never dropped below 3/4 full. I got the Xiao long bao. Size was smaller than some other places I've seen, but taste was good and the soup inside wasn't overly heavy. The dan dan noodles were good too, very balance pork to noodle ratio. The restaurant was really clean and had some outdoor seating (very limited though). Would recommend stopping by if the craving for Chinese food kicks in while you're on the UWS.",0
"Wow wow Bao! We came here knowing we wanted some Asian food, we had zero expectations when we got seated, the service wasn't excellent, but Dear God, the FOOD! We tried the Mapo Tofu, Eggplant un Garlic Sauce and Sweat and Sour Ribs. I can't even start explaining how good it was. Not to mention that the Ribs are the best ribs I ever had in my life... (and I am old, and I have seen stuff), but this ribs are another thing, from another life. The patio is a bit crowed and not sure they are following 6 feet apart rule during Covid-19 times, but I never felt unsafe and all employees wearing N95 masks, although covered the air flows very well. Service was ok. I am definitely coming back when in NYC next time. I am sure I will be craving this food while in DC. Delicious!",1
The place is always lively and the drinks are always good. I especially love the blackberry tequila and margaritas! The popcorn chicken is also very good - though a bit overpriced.,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was quick and the waiter was able to answer all of my questions about the menu. The location is smaller, so it's probably not the best place for a large group, but the decor is cozy and cute. The portions were all large for the price and the quality of the ingredients was really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the mood for Mediterranean food!",1
"Had dinner here with a friend and enjoyed our experience! It was busy but they have a cute outdoor set up and tables are separated by a plastic divider. The servers were very busy but taking one star away because it took us an hour to get our food after we ordered! It shouldn't take 45 min to make Brussel sprouts. We also had to ask multiple times for water, napkins, and utensils.  However, once we did get our food - everything was delicious! I had the crispy rice bowl and shared the crispy brussel sprouts with ""The Watermelon Drink"" to drink. It was all very filling with fresh ingredients and reasonably priced!",0
"Loved the pad see ew here! Pad see ew is my favorite Thai dish so I usually get this whenever I try a new Thai restaurant. The portion was really good for a lunch special size. Together with the spring rolls for the lunch special, I was able to eat this for two meals!The vegetable & tofu pad see ew was flavorful and just the right amount of sweetness-- really good. Not too oily either. The veggies were generous. I feel like most veggie pad see ews have two leaves in the dish, but this one had plenty of veggies! Also, they let you pick both vegetables & tofu as one options, whereas most other Thai restaurants make you choose between veggies & tofu, and if you want both you have to pay more. The noodles had just the right amount of chewiness.I got take out and the food was ready before estimated! Great service and friendly employee. I will return to Thai Chella when that craving hits again. Yummy!",0
"Quick and easy, the lines are normally long but we hit this place up just after 10:30a in order to avoid the crowds (and it was still a short line). $4.50 for a roast pork or chicken over rice w/ some veggies - best deal in the area for a hearty meal.The roast duck ($21 whole, $11 half) is good, though salty and not as flavorful as the place in Flushing, but still satisfies some cravings.",0
"Tator tots on FLEEK!The tots come packed with Bacon, Aged Cheddar & Chives, let me warn you however they pack a nice kick to them and these came out of the kitchen very hot almost burning the tongue. For me to give them five stars and almost causing me bodily harm you know they are out of this world!Ordered the Pastrami Reuben Spring rolls which were suprisely light and absolutely delciious accompanied with great sauces including a hot mustard sauce which will send you to the moon and back.Four chicken wings that were okay at 16 bucks I would pass on next time but the spot is a great find with a wide array of flavorful beers and a good vibe. There was a party going on while we were there relatively early on a Saturday around 1:30pm and they were definitely enjoying themselves. This is a great spot to come for a football game no doubt if you want to stray away from the typical bar food and want to class it up a notch.",0
The food tasted like the restaurant had made a large amount in bulk and it was kept heated to be served throughout the day. I got the dduboki and bulgogi lunch special and my rice and spicy rice cakes were mushy and soggy. The bulgogi was alright. Would not recommend.,0
I had a great time at Carbolicious! The noodles with chicken were flavourful and filling. I couldn't finish it! The restaurant is cute and the staff are friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend Carbolicious to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
"The Chester has Meatpacking District written all over it. They play loud, clubby music, only beautiful people seem to patronize it, and it's overpriced. I've only been once and it was during covid. They have an open air patio that consists of 4 or 5 large, voluptuous booths, and along the edge is a long, narrow bar top with bar stools. When we arrived they asked if we had a reservation, which we did not, so they led us to a couple bar stools. I asked if we could sit at a booth and the guy kind of gave me a snooty scoff -- how dare I ask for a booth without a reservation!Anyway, the drinks and food were fine. I had the ham & cheese on baguette and my bf had the grilled chicken sandwich, both came with a little tin of fries. Wine for me, beer for him. We were starving when we arrived and overall we were satisfied. Our server was okay. When we sat down she asked if we wanted sparkling or still. I instinctively said still thinking we'd get a couple glasses of tap, but instead ended up with a $9 gigantic glass bottle of Italian still water. Woops -- that's my bad, I guess. In terms of covid, it felt safe enough given it's an open air patio, and each party was roughly 6 feet apart. Servers wore masks. People sitting down had masks off and put them back on upon leaving.",0
"Such a great find! I stumbled upon Zurutto when I was in the neighborhood and I'm so glad I did. The menu is on the small side but the food is great! I had one of the ramens, my husband had a rice bowl and we shared the shrimp Mayo. The service was friendly and the food came out super fast. The place is small so it might be worth making a reservation if you are more than two people. Definitely worth a visit!",0
"Just Salad is great - all fresh ingredients and they don't skimp. I tried the California Salad which is a nice low calorie, low sodium option. It was really good without all the guilt. I tried the buffalo ranch dressing on the side which was yummy. And you can add an optional piece of bread.

There was no line when I arrived and my salad was made quickly. The staff was also very pleasant. Overall great place to grab a healthy salad or meal with lots of options.",1
"We had an excellent meal here last night before going to the theatre.  We arrived a 25 minutes early for our 6:15 reservation and had no trouble being seated, there were plenty of tables available.  By 6:10, the place was jammed.  I started out with a Dia de los Muertos Porter, which was fine; my wife had a red wine and our son a marguerita.  As appetizers we had  trio of ceviches - the tuna and yellowtail were especially noteworthy; the octopus was fine too.  The others shared a guacamole; I don't eat it but the salse that came tieh the chips was rich and fine to eat.  Our main courses were roasted shrimp Toloache (five plump and very tasty shrimp in a nice sauce), carnitas served in a cake-like form, with a hazelnut mole, and queso fundido).  The desserts were so tempting that I found it hard to choose - we ended up with the chocolate cake with hot rocks (pictured below).Service was excellent as well; attentive but not cloying.  There was much to like on the menu, and on another trip to New York I hope to be back to explore further",0
"Came to the flower shop on a Friday night for a friend's birthday gathering.  I was the first to arrive so I took the time to observe the atmosphere while waiting.  There are two level to this establishment which seemed to have two different vibes to each.  Upstairs has tables for people to enjoy the food and a bar area for individuals to hand and converse.  The ambiance gives you a feeling that you've went back in time.  The music isn't too loud and the dim lights make it nice for a date or a friendly hangout.  The downstairs portion is where the fun happens.  After a bit the music was bumping with some hip hop and todays hits.  There are televisions, a pool table and a dance floor for those who want to shake their....The bartenders on both levels are attentive and worked fast despite the packed crowd on each.  When I first walked in, I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by the downstairs vibes which was up my alley with the good music and a diverse crowd of individuals just enjoying themselves.  They some interesting cocktails and your average beer selection.  I would definitely come back here on a weekend night and recommend giving this spot a try.",0
"I had a lovely birthday brunch at Berimbau this summer! I did some research on NYC restaurants known for fun outdoor dining and I found Berimau on TikTok, so I made a reservation on Resy. I was with a party of 5 and we sat outdoors in their back patio area. The décor and ambiance were lovely - There are some cool neon signs to take nice group pictures with.We were seated right on time and started with some cocktails of course. I had the Caipirita ($14) which is essentially their version of a spicy margarita - I highly recommend. We also shared the chicken & cheese croquettes ($13) and cheese empanadas ($13). Both were tasty, but the empanada stole the show.For my meal, I ordered the Moqueca Baiana ($29) which is a seafood stew containing a HUGE piece of halibut along with some shrimp, calamari, mussels and a delicious coconut milk base broth - OMG yum. Halibut is one of my favorite fish and I was so happy this dish was well-done & really complimented the star of the dish. My friends also tried a few other dishes that they raved about, including the Strogonoff ($22) and the Salmon ($25). We had to end this delicious meal on a sweet note, so we ordered the brigadeiro (which are creamy chocolate fudge balls - $10) and the caramel flan ($10). Everything was cooked to perfection and I had an amazing time celebrating my birthday with great food, drink, ambience and company.My only negative critique is on the service. Our server wasn't friendly at all and it was difficult to flag him down at times, but we didn't let that put a sour taste in our mouths!",0
"I finally tried this spot and I'm glad I did! The dry pot is my favorite dish in Szechuan cuisine and I ordered it with fish and tofu. The portion was all right - definitely enough for dinner, considering you also get a cup of rice. The fish was fantastic - delicious and moist. The tofu was very disappointing - it was fried and had no taste. I didn't end up eating it. I will definitely order again when the cravings kick in - just the fish next time though!",1
"I was invited to try the tasting menu at 3 Times 茅庐, and I was very pleased with the experience. Jasmine was gracious and attentive and explained all of the authentic Chinese cuisines. The tasting menu had large portions and more unusual dishes than on the regular menu. My friend and I enjoyed the calimari, succulent chicken and seafood dishes. Thank you for showing us what your restaurant is capable of!",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant, but my friend's experience wasn't as great. The staff was great, but the portions were tiny and the prices were a bit high. I ordered the fig and olive salad and it was delicious. My friend ordered the steak and eggs and she said it was overdone and not very well seasoned. We both paid $30+ for each entrée plus tax and tip, so it wasn't a cheap meal. I would definitely come back, but I would recommend ordering something else than the steak and eggs.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food arrived warm and very tasty. I got the shrimp pad Thai and the tofu pad see ew. Both dishes were great. The taste of both dishes were authentic and very well done. The portions were average sized. The shrimp pad Thai came with four pieces of shrimp and it wasn't bad. I shared those dishes with my partner and it was pretty filling. The price was awesome, too. Everything was great in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
Overall good experience. We sat outside a few weeks ago when we were in the area and unfortunately it was freezing and there weren't any heaters. These are COVID times though and we chose to sit outside so that's not their fault! We got nachos which were pretty decent. I wish the cocktails had been a little stronger for the price but they were very very tasty either way. Our waitress was super attentive and friendly. There were a lot of people eating inside but they were all completely separate and distanced which was great to see.I've come here many times before covid and this place is usually packed - just happy to see they're still doing well and can't wait to return again soon. Bartenders are usually very attentive and food has historically always been very good esp for bar food.,0
Food closed way before posted closing time. Surprised place is still open. Super loud inside with one person in the establishment.,0
"Da Dong is a popular Beijing-based restaurant that has opened its first location in New York City. Unfortunately, the restaurant's vibe is not right for the Chinese food I grew up eating. The restaurant is all about looking good on Instagram, with little focus on the food itself.

The duck I had was tasty, but the white waiter's question about how to eat it really stuck out in my mind. It's clear that a white person would be better equipped to help a group of Chinese diners understand how to enjoy Peking duck. Even if you're not familiar with the dish, you can still enjoy it at Da Dong.

Overall, I would recommend Da Dong if you're looking for a restaurant with good food and atmosphere, but I would not recommend it if you're looking for a traditional Chinese restaurant.",1
"Food was good but I it was quite pricy. Cocktail was also good. Would want to give it a 3.5 star because the portions are really small.They also change their menus from time to time so the items I reviewed might not be available in a month or so. Fried chicken - flavor was good but the coating was too thickFried fish lettuce wrap - it's like fish taco with lettuce. One order comes with 2 ""tacos"" only so we had to double the order to share with 4 people. It was so good and we had to order it again. However, an order was $20 so we spent $80 on fish tacos!Thai curry noodle - it's good but not outstandingFried French bread - the honey butter was so good! But one order only came with 2 pieces of bread. Seared scallop was also good.",0
"Super delicious and was way more filling than I thought! Came out to be ~$180 with a beer, so it is very pricy. The beef were my favorite - melt in your mouth delicious. I love hotpot and the sauces that came with it were really good. The spicy one is pretty spicy! I have a decent spice tolerance and I would be careful with this! The service was really attentive. It's a small space, so get here early! They also seat by whoever comes first, so you can get the prime viewing spots!",0
"I have had Vic's bookmarked on Yelp pre-pandemic-and I don't remember what I had read about it but going through my list, I thought it would be a good option for lunch/brunch since they take reservations and the usual brunch suspects do not (on the weekends). If you have read any of my past reviews, you know I'm always on the prowl for a great BEC -and when I looked at Vic's brunch menu online, prior to visiting,  they had one with caramelized onions ( be still my beating heart) and chili aioli. Sold! So, we get to Vic's-are seated outside with a heat lamp, partitions, temp checks, the whole 9, and I scan the little thingy to see the menu and lo and behold, there's no BEC on the menu. It actually crossed my mind to leave, since I didn't want anything else but first world  problems...we ordered the fried chicken (friend enjoyed it much), the eggs with greens (other friend liked it as well) and the server suggested the prosciutto egg sandwich for me (no thanks) or the scrambled eggs that came with bread and I could possible make a sandwich out of. Anyway, I did order the latter and it came with one small piece of bread so that didn't quite work out. The eggs were good, greens were wilted with brown edges. Service and coffee was very good. We were in and out in 45 minutes. But weren't rushed-the food came out literally 5 minutes after we orders though. Vic's was good, but won't be back, at least for brunch anyway.",0
"I was disappointed with my lunch at Glaze Teriyaki, mainly because of the poor presentation of the food. The salmon was overcooked and dry, and the salad was quite fresh. The dumplings were decent, but they were not as crispy as they should have been. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I went to Momofuku Ramen for dinner and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The pork belly buns were my favorite thing, but the ramen itself was a bit dry. The spicy cucumber salad was also good, but at $12 it's a bit overpriced. Overall it was a decent experience, but I would recommend going to other 3-4 star ramen joints in the city for a lower price.",1
"I'm a fan of East River Eatery for their delicious sesame chicken and dumplings. I've ordered from them a few times now and it's always come quickly and neatly packaged. The soup dumplings are also a great option to try - I've heard they're pretty good! Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"There is no surprise that Hong Chun Cheon specializes in Dakgalbi as one can tell from their menu so that's exactly what we ordered. It comes as a stir fry of pieces of chicken thighs, fresh cabbage, scallions and what appears to be watercress too. Surprises in there were a few pieces of tteokbokki (rice cakes) and Sweet Potato Fries (exceptionally crispy yet tender on the inside). We took our server's recommendation and went for Medium on the spicy scale since he did warn us that Hot (the next higher spice level) could be a bit extreme. He was kind enough to get us a sample of the sauce that goes in the Hot Dakgalbi when our Medium-spiced Griddle came over, and woah were we glad we took his recommendation.The food was well portioned, very flavorful and the service was great.We got there at 6pm and within minutes of our arrival, the place started filling up until we saw a waitlist start up.100% satisfied my desire to try the cheese dakgalbi at Hong Chun Cheon. This was a solid experience!",0
"They usher you in with promises of free alcohol. Which isn't really the case. It's ""free"" and limited. The food is just okay. I mean you've got a clam house in the middle of all this amazing Italian cuisine, what are you expecting? It's a smaller space as far as dining goes, and I did feel a little sick after eating here immediately (I regret my raw bar selection). I wouldn't say the food was hitting the spot for me. My guests seemed to enjoy their food, appetizers.Tommy ""the Nose"" is a great guy but he should probably let people eat in peace. I'm not sure if I'd go back, but I give 2 stars for the effort they do try to bring people in and they can be a bit entertaining if you're not in a rush and don't mind the hovering.",0
"I had a great time at Wagamama Chelsea! The food was delicious, and the service was great. I especially loved the tuna tataki and banana katsu. The only downside was that the banana katsu wasn't as sweet as I wanted it to be. Otherwise, everything was great! I would definitely come back and try the other foods.",1
"The bread with olive oil was a nice start to this dining experience. Andrea ordered scallops with a salad, and myself the pasta bolanaise. They got my order wrong which I mentioned and they took it back and redid it. It came back corrected 20 minutes later which we were not happy with to put it mildly. Long story short, our waiter asked if we wanted dessert and we said no. They came back with a very good lemon meringue cake and cookies that were complimentary. Everyone makes mistakes. It is how you handle them that is important. They stepped up to address theirs, turning a 2 star review into a 4 star review. I had to deduct something. We enjoyed the music with the 2 singers that were there.  Given how they handled the issue with my order, I definitely would go back.",0
"We ordered Shanghai Asian Cuisine's Restaurant Week To Go lunch special for takeout, which included steamed pork xiaolongbao, fried pork chops with noodle soup, and two small fried spring rolls. For $20.21 (pre-tax), this was an adequate deal (with the MasterCard $10 statement credit, a much better one).The soup dumplings were terrific. The dumpling skin was thin, the inside soupy, and the ratio of skin to meat appropriate. These were the main draw for me and definitely satiated my xiaolongbao craving during this COVID-19 draught. Even slightly cold, they hit the spot. However, the fried pork chops with noodle soup were disappointing. For one thing, the noodles were placed within the soup, so that by the time we brought them home, the noodles were soggy and overcooked. The noodles and soup should have been separated in two different containers. Even so, the noodles and soup were bland in flavor. The fried pork chops and fried vegetable spring rolls were also forgettable and unnotably seasoned. I appreciate Shanghai Asian Cuisine's perseverance in adapting to and staying open during the pandemic. However, I'll likely stick to their soup dumplings in the future.",0
"Some friends and I after heading out from bars around midnight were looking for a place to eat. After feeling weary from our long night out, we were on the grind to find a sit-down restaurant because after all it is the city that never sleeps..there must be some place that'll fulfill us. After searching thoroughly through Yelp we came across this restaurant serving quality Japanese food located in East Village and open until 3AM for dine-in, it was meant to beThis place was pretty small and can be harder to spot. The outdoor dining looked a bit make-shift, but actually ended up being a complete vibe. It resembled one big shed and each section by was completely closed off so it felt like an intimate, quieter space to enjoy your meal. We order some sake to start. I asked for the most popular sakes and Kitaya was one of them. It had a hint of fruitiness and was super smooth. For food we got pork yakiniku, which is a BBQ pork belly with grilled onions. I'm a pork belly fan and this was just delicious, the BBQ intensity was just right and paired with onions brought out a delicious mix of flavor. The other dish was chicken nanban, which I also was a big fan of. What made this dish so good was the tartar on top which had such a rich, creamy flavor. The chicken also was cooked with sweet and sour sauce which combined with the tartar was an ultimate end to my night. The service was also terrific given all these dishes were so freshly prepped and served at such a late hour. I did have to go in a couple times for a few requests as it was taking longer than expected, but other than that no issues. Would definitely stop by here again if I'm in East Village.",0
We had a less than enjoyable experience with our stop for brunch. We didn't see our server for almost 15 minutes after sitting down.  We stuck it out to try a couple sliders and beers. We tried the maple bacon sliders on biscuits and honestly couldn't taste the bacon or any maple so it was sort of bland. Fries were good though.,0
Got the chicken over rice and I was amazed! The service was great and I was able to share my serving with a friend. Amazing place,0
"Ok. It's across from my office, so pre-covid was much better than post/present COVID. The food was ok, and even cheap beer grossly overpriced. Now you order through your phone so there is no real table service yet they ask for gratuity? We were sitting outside for quite awhile, drinking some beers, eating lunch, but not once, not even for a second did anyone ask how anything was, need anything else, etc. You do it yourself. For the price point I expected some modicum of service. The system was confusing when you added more to the bill and overall just not a great experience.Pre-covid this place was a pretty solid option, now I'd skip it all around.",0
"I had a decent experience at this restaurant, despite my dish not being my favorite. I definitely want to try their Big chicken platter, which I hear is really good. The baked buns were also good. I would recommend this place to others.",1
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The pizza is really good - it's thin but chewy, and I really enjoyed the cheese and sauce. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it for a good pizza. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"FOOD: pretty decent, nothing is too overpriced. i tried their calamari, sweet & spicy chicken, & yellowtail carpaccio. rolls were okay, nothing special, but lots of options. i did get their marshmellow cocktail which was decent too. SERVICE: really great. the hostess was so kind & so was our server. food came out fast. AREA: you have to go down a flight of stairs first, it's kind of hidden in ktown. i like how the lighting is set up and there are a lot of tables.",0
"Atlas Kitchen is a great addition to the area around Columbia University. The menu has a lot of interesting and unique Chinese American fare, and the prices are reasonable. The service was good, and the dining area was comfortable. I don't think it's as good as some of the better Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or Flushing, but it's definitely worth checking out.",1
"I ordered the regular poke classic bowl for take out here and I really liked it. I love poke because its has veggies and raw seafood, both of which I love. All the ingredients were fresh and the tuna delicious. It was spicy and I always love spicy and the portion was huge. I will come here again for lunch if I'm around the neighborhood.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was friendly and the food was great. I was a little disappointed that my friends arrived later than expected, but I had no problem finding a table and having a few drinks while waiting for them. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Came here because a friend recommended me to try one of their fried pork rice dishes. Unfortunately, because I misinterpreted what exactly my friend wanted me to try, I decided to order it the next time I visit, if ever. I did, however, tried some of their other dishes.The highlight of this trip was the pan-fried rice noodles (cheurng fun). It has the perfect light crispiness on the outside and a tender chewy center. The semi-burnt lining has the toastiness and taste of burnt rice at the bottom of a stone pot. Overall, it's pretty good and something I've never seen elsewhere.We shared a club sandwich which included lettuce, tomato, pickles, ham, and corned beef scrambled eggs sandwiched between 3 slices of buttered toast. It tasted standard and the ham was super salty. My mom ordered a cup of hot HK style milk tea and she said it was barely warm. My brother ordered the spam and egg over rice, which also tasted very ordinary.The service here was kind of slow. Took a while for us to get a waiter to take our order and the waitress forgot our tea until we flagged her down for something. I'd probably only come back for the pan-fried rice noodles and to try the fried pork rice dish as recommended by a friend. Otherwise, the food is ordinary compared to the many other restaurants in Chinatown.",0
"Came here for an anniversary dinner and everything was delicious. Nothing was a miss, and the standouts for me were the caviar dish and the dessert course (apple). My husband had different ""favourite"" dishes which just goes to show that everything here is quite good and there's something for everyone.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The menu is small but varied, and I enjoyed my meal especially the Napoli flatbread and salad. However, I was disappointed when I took my food to go. The flatbread was basically folded in the container so half had no cheese, other half had double. Additionally, the salad was fresh and quite tasty, but I was disappointed that it was basically folded in the container and therefore half of it was missing the cheese. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and I would definitely recommend it!",1
Dinner with a friend here after an event...nice quaint little place in the East Village for southern comfort food. No wait time at all for a table given it was a bit late. Not a big menu but enough choices to make some quick decisions since we were hungry.We share fried chicken (dark meat eaters) and market vegetables. Service was good and food came out quick. Will have to come back again to try some other items from the menu.,0
"This place exceeded our expectations! Atoboy is the sibling restaurant of Atomix, a 3 star Michelin restaurant in New York City, but it offers smaller yet less expensive menus. We loved all dishes we tried. All plates came in beautifully decorated and they tasted exceptionally. The only con was that the environment felt a bit dull and ""cold"".",0
"I ventured out to this ramen place based on the reviews and it was a bit of a gamble. The decor and atmosphere felt a little cramped, but it wasn't too bad. The wait wasn't too long and the staff was nice and attentive.

The food was good - I ordered the duck taco and the short rib ramen. The duck taco was very good - the duck was tender and not dry, and the sauce was very good. The ramen was a bit of a disappointment - the noodles were wavy, and the soup base was bland. However, the braised short rib was very tender and fell off the bone. The pork belly added a lot of flavor, and the egg was cooked well.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at this ramen place. I don't know if I'd come back, but I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
Pretty average and honestly a little overpriced for the area. Hummus and pita was $10. A salad was $12. Expected less! The arugula salad with farro and cashews was good though!Service was average. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the friendliest lol. They seemed a little but like they were always in a rush and didn't want to spend more than the minimum time they had with out. Overall I probably wouldn't come back unless someone else suggested it and I tagged along. It wasn't terrible but just nothing that impressed me either,0
"The first time I visited this restaurant, the food and drinks were great. The service was great too (Halloween day). The oysters were huge and so good.

The second time I visited, the food took so long to come and when we arrived there were only 4 tables occupied. I felt like the person taking care of us was getting everyone else but us. The oysters came after our entree. I would give this restaurant a 5 but because the second time wasn't as good, I gave it a 4.",1
Order:- Shoyu Ramen (4/5)- Kara-age (4/5)Pros:- Great tasting food- Good portion sizes - Variety of ramen to choose from Cons:- Not all food options off of the menu were available when we ordered - they did not have the gyoza Overall: I was thoroughly impressed with my to-go order and definitely think that the food will be better fresh at the restaurant,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! We were a little late for our reservation, but they were gracious and held the table for us. The high table was perfect for us, and our waiter was friendly and professional. We ordered a bunch of tapas to share, and everything came out perfectly and delicious. Our drinks, margaritas, of course, were all great. I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"Dim Sum Sam has been on my rotation of lunch options pretty regularly.  Located in Flatiron, they have an assortment of dim sum, but my favorite things to order are probably the rice bowls or the noodle soups which are comforting on a rainy day.I usually get my orders to go but they have a dining area in the back.  The restaurant is bright, clean and airy.  Sometimes during busy periods, the wait after you order can be up to 10 -15 min long.  You can also use their website to place your order online and pick up in the store.  I've been here several items and everything I've ordered so far is super delicious.  You can also see the kitchen where they make everything to order which is cool!My favorite items are the + Shrimp and Pork Wonton Noodle Soup+ BBQ Roast Pork over RiceThe prices are very reasonable, portions are filling and the staff is helpful.  Highly recommend!",0
"I love this restaurant for lunch! The line can get long, but the staff moves quickly and it's usually pretty noisy, but that just adds to the fun. The chicken poblano was delicious - the dressing had the perfect amount of kick. And I love the idea of the reusable bowl! Can't wait to try more menu items.",1
"When I first ate here many years ago it was very popular, the food was good quality and the portions was decent for the price. I feel like the more years that past, the worse the quality, and portion of the food. The price had gotten higher and their portions and quality is much less than before. Needless to say, I don't frequent here anymore because it's a disappointment to what it use to be and to Hong Kong cafes in general. There are plenty other good Chinese restaurants to choose from in The area of Chinatown. I really hope they can step up their game and not just about making the $.",0
"The Korean restaurant I went to had a very extensive menu with BBQ and single dish options. I went with the Bibimbap and a bottle of Pomegranate ""Good Day"" Soju. The drink came first - a 375ml bottle of cold flavored soju that tasted a lot like medicine and only became acceptable after the alcohol hit. The Bibimbap was served in a hot stone pot with a layering of rice, meat, veggies, and egg. The meat was more burnt than it should be, though the egg was perfectly runny to complement the rice. The service here took it's sweet time to get my order in as well as for the check, while the dishes were delivered quickly. I wasn't feeling the food all that much, so probably won't try the BBQ options.",1
This is a restaurant that has many restaurants  thought the city ' our first time  ( good location for theater) we had insalata di  Porto Cuervo ( Romain lettuce hearts of palms and avocado with a light lemon dressing it was good but $20 ) spaghetti squash I was glad to see something vegetarian was on this menu it was good  not a lot of flavor. they also had a very interesting pizza which I did not order which was gluten-free Maybe I'll try it if I go there another time another dish that we  a had was tagliatelle Al pollo very good We order ricotta cheesecake which was very good but $14 prices have gone out of sight but it is what it is so if you're going out to dinner be prepared For the shock of the new pricing Of dining out,0
"I was a little concerned going into our meal at this restaurant, as it had 3.5 stars and reviews I had heard from friends. However, the old school steakhouse feel was still there, and our waiter was okay. The food did come out correctly, and the seasonal corn side was fantastic. Our steak was a little overcooked, but not to the point where we sent it back. At the end of the meal, they surprised us with cheesecake for our birthdays, which was really appreciated. Overall, the experience was positive, and I'm glad we tried something new. However, there are definitely better steakhouses in the city.",1
"I didn't like this pizza at all. Ordered a 14 inch pepperoni and sausage for lunch pickup today and it was $17 which I would have thought was reasonable had it not tasted truly like dollar slice. It was the quintessential dollar slice crust - soft and sweet. Toppings were generous and the sauce and cheese were okay, but nothing to write home about. It just tasted like very cheap pizza.Pickup was easy - it was ready when I got there and was fast. It was still super hot when I picked it up and reheated well when I got home. All in all, totally edible but pretty bad quality. I would have opted for a frozen pizza over this.",0
"Thursday Kitchen is definitely a restaurant that I love! The wait can be a bit long on the weekends, but it's definitely worth it. The service is always great and the drinks are always nice and strong. The food is absolutely amazing and I've never had anything here that I didn't love. My personal favorites are the truffle Mac and the kimchi paella, but everything here is great. The steak was cooked perfectly and came with a great side of grits. I'll definitely be back here!",1
"I had a pretty average Korean food experience at this restaurant. However, the experience was ruined after I noticed a cockroach on the wall. The server was too scared to kill the cockroach herself, so she informed the kitchen. From that point on, the restaurant went about its business as if the cockroach never happened. Eventually, the cockroach dropped from the wall and disappeared into some unknown hole. Unfortunately, our appetites were not as hungry anymore after this turn of events. The wings we got as an appetizer were not spicy at all, and the mains we ordered were all pretty good. The prices are not too bad, and the service is adequate.",1
"I was really disappointed with my recent experience at this restaurant. First of all, the delivery driver was really strange - he was very rude and couldn't find my apartment even though I've ordered food from them before. Secondly, the sushi was really average and the packet miso soup was really bland. Overall, I don't think I'll be ordering from here again.",1
"Headed over about 5:30pm - early dinner vibes. It was that kinda of day...They have 3 tables and bar seating, with one additional table outside. The service was nice and courteous. They have a few fixed menu items (avg. $16), rolls ($6-8), and build your own option for poke (starting price was $16 and they charge per topping *gasp*)I went with the classic featuring:2 pieces of yellow tail, 2 salmon, and 2 tunawith a tuna tartarJapanese picklesand edamame were includedOn a bed of Half salad / half rice.I really enjoyed it - finished every bite. Quality of fish was nice. Will definitely be coming back when in the area but will likely stick to the fixed menu or rolls. The build your own just sounded a little pricey.",0
"Overall, I was disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The beet chips were good, but the artichokes and sauce were both mediocre. The octopus was also just OK, and the croquettes were bland. The gnocchi was the worst dish of the night - it was dry and lacked flavor. The decor is cute, but the food just didn't live up to my high expectations.",1
"I had a great meal at Aunt Jake's today and our server and bartender (Queen) Elizabeth was a true gem! Had the  homemade gluten free rigati pasta with the roasted garlic pecorino. It was basically a delicious, warm, cheesy macaroni topped with fresh basil and perfect for a cold, rainy October night. Elizabeth made a gorgeous cucumber lemonade that was perfectly tart and topped with fresh cucumber. Also had the risotto with sage and mushrooms which was the true star of the night (and deliciously gluten free). Can't wait to come back and swim in risotto! I'll also try the Sunday Sauce which I saw had short rib in it.

Food was ready in a blink, service was fantastic, outdoor seating was great for this semi-post COVID era and had a heater to boot!

P.S. This is a great place to have dinner after a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A very short walk.",1
"Really cute, Pinterest-y interior. Humble and warm. Windows open in summer months for an outdoor feel. Service was on top of everything and helpful. Food presentation was exceptional and everything did taste good...don't get me wrong. However, some items fell flat compared to my expectation. APP: Meatballs were tender and tomato sauce was tangy. No major complaints just didn't blow me away. Mozzarella sticks did not have much of a pull; cheese was a little hard inside. The sauce for dipping was delicious though! A sort of pesto tzaiki. Truffle Mac & cheese lived up to expectation, ooey gooey in a skillet! ENTREE: The ""special"" or burger on focaccia with a huge fried slab of mozzarella had a really great sauce and was very hearty, but the meat was flavorless and over cooked (asked for medium). Truffle fries on the side were yummy and perfectly crisp. DESSERT: Nutella cheesecake was SUCH a disappointment. Could barely taste Nutella and was not creamy texture wise--tasted defrosted from the freezer. Would NOT order dessert here again. DRINK: Enjoyed the wine, recommend their Montepulciano. Would still return as I must try the instafamous burrata pizza--but I'll keep expectations mediocre for that time around.",0
"I had a great time at this Persian restaurant on the Upper East Side. The service was great, the food was clean and attractive, and the prices were very reasonable. I especially enjoyed the tomato, cucumber and parsley salad and the walnut pomegranate chicken stew. Both were incredibly delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice lunch or dinner.",1
"we ordered the roasted fish w poached egg which is delicious but not that fancy. over rated overall, a bit loud",0
Yummy Taiwanese takeouts! We love the beef wraps and the three cup chicken the most in this order. Will definitely order more often from this place,0
"Super cozy place serving burgers and Mexican good. Very clean and nice service.Ordered a burger, it was fresh and delicious and exactly what I was looking for.Drink specials on a Saturday afternoon included a $6 margarita and $6 sangria - portion a little smaller than your usual place but still fair for the price.Overall I loved my experience here and want to come back and try the mexican food! This place was cozy lowkey and had great food.",0
"Great prices for their lunch special. After having a so-so first experience for dinner here, they became my go-to spot for lunch delivery. Very satisfying lunch options!",0
"Perusing St. Mark for a post-dinner chill spot, my friends and I ended up at Boka. On a Friday night, there were many people trying to get in and out of the place. However, we were very quickly seated; there were ample tables inside.I was first very surprised by how modern and pretty the decor inside was. The black brick walls matched well with the unique light bulbs on the ceiling. There was a bar area with counter seatings and booth areas for larger parties. The place was bustling with customers and active staffs.We got 2 mixed sojus to share, mango and lychee. The Mango soju was rather diluted and didn't taste much different from straight soju. On the other hand, the lychee was delightful, sweet and fresh.Although we have already had dinner, we couldn't resist the aromatic fried chicken smell that permeated the whole place because every table seemed to order it. We got a Medium Combo Platter with 6 wings and 3 thighs. They also let us do a mix between Sweet Spicy and Garlic. The chickens were amazing, soft and juicy on the inside and flavorful and crispy on the outside.With solid food, drinks, and atmosphere that let you hold proper conversation, Boka is a great spot for friends to hangout late into the night.",0
"This place was surprisingly very very impressive. I've tried SMH (Szechuan mountain house) next door and I definitely prefer this place. They have very similar traditional Chinese vibe, dark and aesthetic decor. Highly recommend the braised pork belly, the egg plant, and the fish stew only if Ure ok with super spicy and sour flavor. XLB isn't bad either but I think u could prob get better ones in Chinatown.Overall high recommend, price is reasonable. They require vaccine card!",0
"Walked by here after shopping with a friend, and was seated right away. We ordered the ""special"" for the day the pappardelle with truffle. The pasta wasn't even al dente, it tasted uncooked. Overall this dish was ok. However I opted to try another dish- the rigatoni w/ tomato sauce and burrata. This tasted much better and flavorful. I couldn't order the LPB burger because there's has beef and bacon,  which I don't eat. They had no other options for the burger. I'd say this place is trying, but nothing special for Italian food.  The staff is nice, maybe I'll be back to try something else.",0
"I had the Maine lobster salad from here and it might just be my favorite salad ever. It has so much lobster (both times I've had it has had 5 lobster claws) it is fairly expensive but I think very worth the price and the salad itself is really good, the dressing is a bit sour but not overpowering, and everything else in the salad is fresh and good!

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant - the lobster salad was delicious and definitely a must-try! However, it is a bit on the expensive side, so if you're not in the mood for a luxurious meal, I would recommend picking something else.",1
"This restaurant has been steadily declining over the last few months. The lunches specials are no longer as good as they used to be, and the prices have gone up. The drunken noodles with shrimp had only three large size shrimp in it, and the chicken specials are no longer as good as they used to be. The seasonings on the noodles were not cooked long enough, and the spring roll was greasy. I don't think I'll be returning here in the near future.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying GupShup, but unfortunately it was not worth the hype. The decor is thoughtful, but there is Hindi written everywhere and the dish-ware is pretty but detailed. The menu has listed some good items, but the execution is mediocre (not very flavorful) and the dishes aren't worth the price (to expensive for the taste & quality). The cocktails are well thought out, but a warning to non-drinkers - SOME MOCKTAILS HAVE THE SAME NAME AS COCKTAILS. SPECIFY MOCKTAIL WHEN ORDERING. This is a big one for me because people are non drinkers for an array of reasons and ending with a cocktail when you don't drink, could be horrible. This ruined our evening. Definitely would not recommend you rush out to GupShup - but if you do decide you want to go, make sure you have a reservation.",1
"I didn't enjoy my meal at this restaurant. The appetizers were good, but the main dishes were mediocre. The pork in every dish was old and not very flavourful. The seaweed salad was also ok, but the pork buns were not very well dressed. The spicy miso ramen was also weak and lacked flavour. The ramen always comes hot, but this one was barely warm. The yaki ramen hakata style was also disappointing. The pork was old and the rest of the ingredients didn't add much flavour to the dish. Overall, the food wasn't very good and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"Although this is by the chef of atomix, I was actually not overly blown away by my meal. $75 for prix fixe, 5 courses, with menus that change every once in a whileStarted off with an amuse bouche, which was just okay1 - gim bugak- didn't really stick out for me2- amberjack - was okay. Again kind of underwhelming3 - sea urchin (+$20) while I do love uni as much as anyone else, this one was just a little bit on the fishier side. Not sure if it was because it also had seaweed, but I really wish it was a more remarkable dish4 - pork collar - again, not super memorable, but a good portion. 5 - granita - is it bad that this was my favorite thing I ate this meal????",0
"I came here for my birthday 11/8/20. They were able to accodomate my party of 8. I loved the black rice and the griot. The griot (fried pork) was not fatty at all. The rice was tasty and not dry. The spaghetti with herring was delicious and I'm not a herring person. I heard the shrimp entree was alright. The macaroni here is also delicious. The fried cheesecake I highly reccomend. The DJ was on point too.I came for brunch 3/27/21. It was so good. I wish they did bottomless. We are drinkers and our bill was WHOA, but worth it. First of all their calamari was well seasoned. The mussels were super delicious and they serve a lot. That broth was heavenly. Like I seriously wanted a to go container of that. The broth was not thick but light with nice fresh herbs. My first timer friends loved the black rice. I had the basa fish with plantains and black rice. The plantains were perfeclty fried my friend kept saying ""I'll come back for those tostones."" lol The fried shrimp was good and the dipping sauce.I had three cocktails. I tried the Mangotini which is made with Vodka, Grand Marnier, lime juice and mango puree. It was sweet and packed a punch. I also had the mimosa and Te Lacaye which is their version of a Long Island minus the coke substitue with Cola Lacaye (Champagne Cola). I loved the switch of the sodas but boy it made wish I can party again. I was lit. They were very accodomating to us  even when some of us were late for the reservations and we sat for a long time. I ordered the fried cheesecake and they definitely have to make it bigger or add another piece.",0
I had a great time at BareBurger! The Impossible burgers were delicious and I didn't miss the cheese at all. The service was great and the atmosphere was fun and casual. The only downside was that the door was left open on a 40 degree day and I had to get up a couple of times to close it.,1
"This place is so underrated, and quickly becoming our favorite spot for a casual dinner in our neighborhood.  It's usually pretty empty so you can almost always get a spot outside.  They start by bringing you dipping sauces and papadum (Indian crispy cracker/flatbread).  We devour this within minutes, and in general I love when places bring you free sauces/breads ahead of the meal.The food is delicious and everything comes quick!  So far we've tried the vegetable samosa, ragda patties, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, garlic naan, and palak paneer.  The palak paneer over rice is my favorite!  We always end up having a ton of leftovers.We went here for dinner two days ago and I'm already looking forward to the next time we come back. :)",0
"Xian was my go-to when I was craving Asian-style noodles in midtown and didn't have time to make the long haul down to Chinatown. Unfortunately, my last visit caused me to question this. Admittedly, I showed up late in the day, so I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised when my go-to order, liang pi noodles, were sold out.  So I ended up ordering the vegetable hand pulled noodles instead. I had an upset stomach that day, so I specifically ordered my noodles with NO spiciness. Unfortunately, the kitchen must've not read the order because my order was FULL of spicy Sichuan hot pepper bits. I took it back and watched as they put my order in a sieve, rinsed it with water, and then inelegantly dumped some soy sauce on top. As you could imagine, there were still hot pepper bits so the order was still spicy. In addition, it was oversalted, and I drank 3 bottles of water during the night because I was so thirsty from the meal. Even if my order has been correct, the vegetables the noodles came with were pretty abysmal. Who serves pieces of potato in an Asian noodle dish?? Other than the wood ear mushrooms and tofu, none of the vegetables were authentically Asian. The one shining bit of this trip was the hand pulled noodles, which were deliciously and freshly pulled as I waited. But I would've rather eaten the noodles plain than have eaten that oversalted sauce.Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'll be back to Xian unless I go early enough in the day that I can guarantee I'll get my liang pi noodles.",0
"We had a great time revisiting Mazu Szechuan Cuisine! The outdoor seating was perfect for a chilly evening, and the martinis and wine we ordered off the happy hour menu were delicious. It was a bit confusing to the server as to whether or not the happy hour was for the bar only, but we're glad they clarified it for us. The food we ordered was all delicious, with our favorites being the dumplings in chili oil and the chicken lo mein. The service was impeccable and the manager was very kind. We can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",1
"3.5 starsClaypot! Get yo claypot, here!If you're gonna have a specialty, try to be good at that specialty. The claypot rice was all over the place. We got the Yellow Eel, Poached Egg with Minced Meat, and Salted Fish. The eel was...just eel. Nothing else. It was fun for all of two seconds, then got as one-note as a Kanye West acceptance speech. The poached egg was a tad better, though not the right texture. And the salted fish didn't have enough fish (maybe the eel ate them all?). We were all amateur claypot connoisseur from childhood, and none of us were particularly impressed.But hey, cheap doe.",0
"I had a great time at the Bo Peep Cocktail Bar! The music was really great and the waitstaff were really talented. I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you're looking for a good night out. It can get quite loud and lively, so if you're looking for a place to talk and have a conversation, this might not be the best spot.",1
"Came here for restaurant week. The place is inside Perrine Hotel and and near Central Park. I was surprised that it was fairly empty when I arrived for a Friday 7pm dinner. The food was pretty good, the two appetizers: tuna tartare and heirloom tomato salad was really good. Tuna was fresh and nicely paired with the sauce. Tomato salad was also refreshing however, wish there was more burrata. The two main course, beef short ribs and swordfish; short rib was nicely paired with the sauce but the swordfish could use a little work; maybe it was the wrong sauce pairing. The desserts were good! Loved the creme brûlée from here, it had a little bit of a citrus taste! The warm chocolate cake was pretty good, warm and chocolaty but can get a bit overwhelming when you eat too much since it's heavy. I would go back to try their lamb chop and other dishes if I'm around the area.",0
"Cool vibe but the food was ""just ok"" for me. It took A LOT of elbow strength to crack those lobsters. The sautéed spinach was ridiculously SALTY. Needed a gallon of water after. Drinks were decent. Service was ok. I just can't for the life of me understand why they ask if you're celebrating a special occasion if there are no treats being offered. Absolutely nothing about this experience would make me a return customer.",0
"I ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli, I think it was broccoli. Food was kinda bland, no seasoning. Not really memorable. I went back here for brunch and it was way better. Not sure if there still up and running after Covid though.",0
"Made reservation, got confirmation, showed up and it was closed.This is not a review on the food but no where on the website did it say it was closed.Maybe resy and momofuku should fix that?",0
"Thank you for dining at our restaurant! We've been serving up delicious food and drinks for years now, and we always try to make our guests feel right at home. Our steak and fries are legendary, and our salads are perfect for any palate. Our passionfruit juice is also a must-try, and we always have a delicious caramel flan to top it all off. Our staff is friendly and welcoming, and we make sure to keep our coffee brewing fresh. Thanks for considering us, and we hope to see you soon!",1
I recently tried out the lunch spot delivery at this restaurant and I was impressed! The salad bowl was bursting with fresh flavors and juicy chicken. It's so fun to be able to customize your meal here and I love that they have so many different options. I highly recommend this spot for a delicious and affordable lunch.,1
"The restaurant Wheeeee is a new spot in town that we were excited to try. Overall, we were just okay with the experience. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but our chicken meatball and squash dishes were both good, and our pork collar was quite disappointing - the sauce was very watery and lacked flavor. The cocktails were all on the light side and stingy on ingredient type of cocktail, trying to charge $16 for them. Overall, we were just okay with our meal at Wheeeee.",1
"This is such a cool futuristic concept . A long narrow corridor lined with futuristic machines and colorful clean minimalistic vibes and seating across the room . An Australian owned, Japanese level cute sushi, sashimi vending institute . You eat and just keep rolling ..",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant again this year. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating, and the food always tastes great. I especially love the appetizers - the wonton soup is my favorite. I don't usually eat a lot of food, but I can always finish an order of vegetable spring rolls. The only downside is that the parking can be a bit tricky - I've had to go looking for a spot near the hospital. But overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"Hidden gem in Kew Gardens, I go to Dani's pizza all the time and did not realize this spot existed right across the street. The restaurant is beautiful, very chic, feels like I'm in the city. We dined on a Friday night, made reservations on open table, it wasn't that busy. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Appetizers- burrata & octopus salad, both very good and fresh. Entree- I had the lasagna which was very cheesy and came with chunks of beef (not small pieces of ground beef) it was delicious. My friend had the pappardelle which she enjoyed (also had chunks of meat).For dessert we shared the tiramisu, which was very good, more of a mousse like consistency. The have a unique cocktail menu, I tried the siamo alla frutta which was similar to a mojito, very light. Overall a great dining experience, perfect for date night.",0
"I don't understand how this place is so popular. Very large slices of overpriced mediocre pizza. I had two slices: the vodka sicilian and the artichoke (what this place is known for). The vodka slice was okay...not my favorite vodka sauce I've ever had. It wasn't very savory. Oddly sweet? It was missing something. There were also weird chucks of cheese on it...like the cheese wasn't spread out very well. Then the most disappointing experience was the pizza this place is named after: the dang artichoke slice. What in the world is this creation? The crust is way too thin to support the slop on top of it. It tastes as if you dumped a can of Campbell's condensed cream of whatever soup on top with spinach and artichoke. Not enjoyable at all. On top of that, the service was subpar. I know a Saturday afternoon in the city is busy, but it took a long time to get just our drinks and then our check and no one really checked on us. You can tell everyone was in a rush. Maybe just this location isn't the best? I'd rather go to a dollar pizza place than here.",0
"TLDR: TriBeCa Italian from Chef Andrew Carmellini. Solid menu but a bit on the pricy side. I personally think their brunch menu is the strongest. Great food but know that it will be a bit expensive.I passed by Locanda Verde for many years before I finally tried it. The restaurant is very classy, you might almost think it were a steakhouse based on the decor.I've had brunch, lunch and dinner and definitely prefer brunch. Everything I've had here is enjoyable but I do think it is a bit costly and maybe not the best value.The focaccia they usually drop on the table is pretty damn good. Try not to fill up too much on it. Absolutely try the Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Truffle/Honey.. this stuff is just so fluffy and good. It's whipped so finely and the way it spreads on the toast, you'll be smiling through each crunchy bite.For brunch, the Scampi and Grits will be something unique. The grits here are polenta and topped with eggs, sausage, tomato and naturally shrimp. I wasn't sure what to think when I first ordered this but it all works, really damn well. I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this. It was garlicy, grainy, sweet, savory and all at the same time. I literally scooped out every last bite.For pastas, the seafood pasta I thought was just alright. The lamb bolognese with the ricotta and touch of mint was fantastic. I don't like mint, like at all - keep that stuff away from my lamb. Strangely enough though, this was good. If you go for dinner, the white veal bolognese was the best pasta for me.The garlic chicken is excellent but way overpriced if you ask me. $72 for a chicken? Oof. The Steak Tartare I thought was not anything special.As I said, come aware that you're probably going to drop $50 to $75 per person and you'll have a tasty meal.",0
"The food and the ambiance of FERNS is what made me give them 5 stars. The aesthetics of the restaurant and everything is so cute! I made a reservation for a party of 4 for Saturday brunch and we were seated right away. The restaurant wasn't packed at the time, but if you want a guaranteed table, might as well make a reservation online. Now for the food: - Blueberry Stuffed Toast: Looked and tasted amazing. It is definitely a sweeter meal, so if you're not a fan of sweet brunch, this may not be the dish for you. - Shrimp Burger: I loved it. The shrimp is mashed into a patty and it was mixed with some veggies and other things that made it taste amazing. I've never had a shrimp burger and FERNS did not disappoint.- Fried Chicken Biscuit: it was quite tasty. Chicken was a tad on the dry side, but I think the sauce helped tie the whole dish together. - Tater Tots: Can never go wrong with some form of potato for brunch. The tots came with a side of a sauce and it was delicious. FERNS has become a new favorite brunch spot for whenever I'm in the city.",0
"Yesterday, I participated in a pizza crawl that my friend organized. This was the second stop. We had fifteen attendees. Hence, the wait for two plain pies was an hour. There was a long line for people ordering slices. I enjoyed it. However, it was a little oily for my taste. Thus, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I still recommend it though. The cheese was freshly made and the crust was thin. Moreover, the crust wasn't burnt.",1
"Upon entering this place I could tell it was going to be a great time. Music was bumpin and inside looked like a tropical paradise.Our group had made a reservation so we were seated accordingly. Unfortunately basically was outdoor but sheltered but they did have ceiling fans but since that day was in the mid 90's it was just circulating hot air. All the employees and bussers were dripping and soiled in their own sweat.Ordering was a breeze considering it was done online through a QR code scan that leads to their website. My main problem was everything was kind of finger food, the ""large dishes"" aka their entrees were basically appetizers as well. The price for food and drinks were pretty expensive, my wife ordered a avocado toast and it was $16 for one slice of bread with avocado... my $40ish pizza was extremely oily and greasyEveryone had a great time but when it came to the food and drinks everyone agreed it wasn't good enough for another visit.",0
"Friedman's is a great place to go for brunch if you're looking for something gluten free. The pancakes and hash browns were both a bit bland, but the lemonade was really good. The servers were really nice and friendly, which made the experience better. I do find Friedman's a bit overrated compared to other brunch experiences I've had, but it's still a great option if you're in the area.",1
"This restaurant is definitely worth checking out - the food is really good and the service is amazing. They have a wide selection of wines by the glass, so you can really enjoy your meal. The atmosphere is really cozy and comfortable, and it's great to have a place like this in the area.",1
"One of my favorite places to eat in the city. It's a nice small restaurant. The bread they bring is so delicious and warm. My favorite is the cavatelli with hot peppers and sausage. Fairly priced, and ordering out the food was still great",0
"Le Pavillon was not my favorite restaurant. For the price point, I thought the food could have been better. Nothing was bad but nothing was amazing. The service was nothing to write home about. They forgot it was my birthday and served my dessert without anything until the very end. It seemed bizarre because the birthday dessert at the table next to ours was served together. I believe it was the same dessert so I felt a little slighted. We couldn't help but overhead the table next to us complaining about finding dead baby flies in their water glasses. It wasn't a surprise because there were baby flies all throughout the restaurant. Absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant of this tier. Later in the night one landed in our water. They have a serious problem that they need to take care of with the flies due to all the plants in the restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this place based on my experience. There are way better options for special occasions in the city.",1
"I was extremely disappointed with my recent experience at this restaurant. My food delivery was over an hour late, and the Asian Bowl I ordered was very disappointing. The slaw was very sparse, and the veggies were mostly overcooked. The portions were also quite small, which was a major disappointment. Overall, this was a very poor experience, and I will not be returning.",1
This ramen wasnt the best. Broth was just ok and the noodles were kinda plain. Overall the dish didnt have much flavor but on the positive side the upgrades such as additional egg or noodles is pretty cheap. I wont be returning.,0
"The staff was friendly and knowledgeable at the bar, which made our dining experience that much better. The food was great, and the company we were sitting with was also great. We really enjoyed the lasagna, and we're looking forward to trying to recreate it at home.",1
"Nice hookah spot , food was really good too ! They do give a lot of food , I love and highly recommend the lamb shawarma! Flavorful & juicy",0
"Saw some labels for vegan pizza while walking by and was immediately intrigued. They have a vegan thick crust square pizza LOADED with toppings, and no cheese (veggie pizza), as well as a thin crust triangle slice vegan pizza, also topped with some veggies. I think I also saw two white vegan pizza slices, one with veggies and one without, but I could be mistaken. I got the thick crust pizza to go, and it was decent, but not mind blowing my good. The pizza was piled high with toppings from mushrooms to black olives, onions, fresh tomato, basil, tomato sauce, and probably more. All of this contributed to great flavor, but an overall soggy pizza. Combined with the thick crust, there wasn't much crunch or crisp left. I like the taste of vegetables, so I didn't mind it too much, but it's definitely not what I would consider the pizza flavor profile. It was also pretty good both fresh and cold the next morning. :) Probably won't be coming back considering the slice was $6.50, but I'm sure the other slices will provide a different perhaps better experience.",0
"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning with a large party of 13 people total. We originally had called the Chelsea location, but they said they were unable to accommodate parties that large. It was nice that when we arrived, they gave us the entire little outdoor gazebo so all of us could fit and we had our own little private area. Food was really a hit or miss depending on what you got. I'm not huge on sweet things for brunch because I always end up craving something savory right after, but if you have a sweet tooth, the only real option for you is the French toast. My friend got the French Toast and said it was good though! I got the breakfast burrito without the chorizo and was pretty disappointed. The tortilla was so hard and tough to cut even though they gave me a different knife. The shallots were not evenly distributed inside, and were all at one end of the burrito. It was pretty bland and I doused it was hot sauce for some flavor- did love the hot sauce though! The home style potatos were also average. Saving the best for last, the southwestern brunch bowl. My friend got this and I had a few bites and absolutely loved it. She asked for the eggs to be scrambled instead of poached, but it was very flavorful and I wish I had ordered that instead. We got some orange juice for the table which was just Tropicana. We thought maybe it had been freshly juiced because they put a sliced orange quarter on the glass, but it seems that was more just for decoration. Service was good and they were accommodating to our large group. I don't think I'll be coming back though because the food wasn't rave worthy.",0
"This has quickly become my go-to spot before a show. It's on a side street and with Times Square so close, foot traffic is lower here and the prices are great! I've only had the sushi though because you can't beat the happy hour price of 2 speciality rolls for $30 (excludes 2, but there are still plenty to choose from). It's such a relief to have a place I can go for a quick dinner because I try to spend as little time in the area as possible because it's so touristy.All the workers are friendly and the food comes out fast. You have to be able to walk a flight of stairs from the street level.",0
"I had a really disappointing experience at David Chang's restaurants recently. Las Vegas was overpriced and the food was mediocre, and most recently, Ssam bar in NYC. My spicy pork was swimming in oil and the soup spoon provided was a joke - to scoop 100% oil (zero broth) and guarantee a trashed stomach? Who on earth wants to enjoy a bowl of oil?

My most frustrating experience was with the service. I took ONE bite of my main course and let it be the entire meal - the staff collected a full bowl of oil without questioning me the slightest.

David Chang's ego has caught up with him - his restaurants are garbage. Avoid this place if you can.",1
"I had a great experience at Porteño! The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the wine selection is fantastic. I especially enjoyed the Malbecs that our waiter recommended. The empanadas were also great, and I especially enjoyed the burrata dish. I would definitely recommend Porteño to anyone looking for a great night out!",1
"I tried the chicken vindaloo lunch platter special at COVID and it wasn't as good as the saag paneer and lamb vindaloo I had before. The chicken was a bit tough and the mixed vegetables were frozen and stringy, but the flavor wasn't bad. The platter was also $8.99, which is a good deal. The service was also friendly.",1
"I was in the neighborhood with a friend and we were craving uni nigiri. I used to love going to the union square location and thought I'd give the midtown location a try. They had just run out of uni so we got just a couple of dishes- the Japanese vegetable tempura which was delightful with Japanese eggplant, pumpkin, mushroom, and pepper all perfectly battered and fried..light and airy without tasting oily. Also tried the twin tuna crisp roll which looked pretty and was not bad. Not the best quality rice or the freshest fish but the rolls do come out very pretty, colorful and generously sized.",0
"The place is good, but the food prep times are a bit long. I know they have a sign that says or used to say that you need to wait 15min or so for food prep - as in it's quite freshly made. That's something to take note of.However my recent experience was I called in at 7:00pm and was expected to have my food ready for pick up at 7:20pm. I arrived at 7:25pm and my order wasn't started yet or it was forgotten. They probably took 10-12 min to make my two dishes and I left the restaurant at 7:35/7:40pm. It just sucks to wait when the food was supposed to be ready by the time I walk in.The food is still good and highly recommended",0
"We came here last Sunday and we were pretty full at the end of the meal. Thankfully, the place wasn't super busy and we were able to get a table right away. We only did hotpot and it's AYCE for $31.99. My favorite hotpot items were the meats (i.e. lamb, beef, beef tripe), stuffed tofu, fish tofu, instant noodles, and tong hao vegetable.  We selected the duo pot for the two soup flavors: chicken broth and tom yum. I liked the tom yum broth but it had a slight spicy kick. I also liked the ""Hometown ultimate sauce"" for dipping my meats.I'll be coming back again one day. Maybe I'll come with my colleagues next time for weekday lunch.",0
"Disappointed that lot of items were sold out before 3pm because I really want to try the black and white sando and spicy chicken kimbap. We ended up getting the crunchy krab kimbap and chicken katsu. It was pricey but since I am stopping by at the vessels, so why not giving it a try since everything around is expensive.",0
"The lobster rolls are pretty great but holy crap this place is so expensive. Came on a Sunday evening for dinner. A friend and I decided to share the  Lobster Roll Picnic Box. The lobster roll was really good but this thing was so tiny! Given that they serve fish and chips I assumed the chips that came with the box would also be french fries, but no we were given a bag of potato chips which didn't really add much to the meal. For the soup we got the Lobster Bisque, which was pretty good but was served to us almost lukewarm. After the meal, we ended up going to another restaurant for ramen cause we were still pretty hungry. Overall, the lobster roll was great and I'm glad I tried it once, but I don't think it's worth coming back for.",0
"While visiting NYC, a friend sent a message to try Burger & Lobster Restaurant.  I was able to make our reservation for dinner through the YELP app.  Thanks YELP!!    Love that the entrance to the restaurant is a tunnel made of lobster traps.  My husband and I arrived a little before our reserved time so enjoyed their specialty drink call Bryant Park Punch.  A refreshing fruity drink.  I enjoyed the lobster Mac n Cheese with a side salad and my husband enjoyed the lobster dinner.  Delicious food at a great price!",0
"I was really impressed with the beautiful umbrellas at this restaurant. The guacamole was delicious and the pollo taco was decent, but the French fries were very oily. The staff was very nice and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I would recommend this place for appetizers and drinks, but not for main dishes.",1
"They told us it would be a 30 minute wait for a Thursday night around 7pm, but I think we ended up waiting much longer than that. It was okay though because we sat by the bar and ordered drinks first. I enjoyed the happy soda which is condensed milk with rose syrup and soda. The rose was very fragrant and I was able to taste the flavor of it.Food was good but the portions were a bit smaller than I expected. We shared the chicken satay skewers, chicken wings, beef redang and a noodle dish. I liked the chicken wings the best. Everything is flavorful and you can taste the spice in each dish.",0
"The mushroom pizza was very good. It was topped with a variety of mushrooms and they were very generous with the mushrooms. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but what can you expect in Chelsea Market, where the rent must be insanely high.",0
"Aw....I could cry. This wonderful little gourmet food shop is listed only as a sandwich shop. Before New York City became unaffordable, this was one of many places that offered delicious options for a party or even a quick dinner at home. William Poll has been a staple of the neighborhood for so long. It was from an era in which one stopped off and picked up delectables. So I doubt it ever entered their minds that someday there would be people who would want to eat in, so to speak. Many food shops were just that, you wouldn't even think of eating in the corner cheese store! You could smell it blocks away! I don't think they even sold any cheese sandwiches, only slabs, wheels and slices.That is the New York I remember, bringing home the treats from various stops. William Poll had the most scrumptious salads. Quality. They have that extra star in my memory for being the best, like William Greenberg was for cakes. Packages of delicious salads from William Poll, along with William Greenberg for dessert, assured a tasty treat for the night's repast. There were other shops where one could pick up delicious specialties. One could always rely on luscious quality goods without outrageous prices. People could have a quick lunch at the soigné little luncheonettes more midtown where the turkey sandwiches were made from turkey roasted on the premises. I'm surprised that William Poll has outlasted the New York that was, to exist in the New York that is.Even in the Westchester town I'm familiar with, food shops were like little gourmet grocery stores. Pasta shops, bakeries dedicated to a cupcake etc. Who'd expect to eat in them! William Poll is from the era when you didn't have to be filthy rich to live and shop that small town way in Manhattan.",0
"Pretty cute bar / restaurant in ktown. Drinks are alright , some are misses and some are hits.",0
"Jacob's Pickles is my favorite brunch spot in the city! The Southern BLT biscuit sandwich is my favorite dish, and the addition of the fried green tomatoes on top really makes it a complete meal. The ketchup is very homemade tasting and I love the vanilla cream dipping sauce. The fried oreos were perfect, and I loved the surprise of them being included as my birthday dessert. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a great brunch spot!",1
Oh em gee. The food was soooo good. Guacamole with that black garlic!!!! Hands down the best guacamole I've ever had. The empanadas was tasty. Especially the chorizo. Highly recommend!,0
Wonderful mushroom croquettas! My all time favorite and have followed them from UES to the Time square location. Though the other items are good too but not as memorable.,0
"tasty desert with multiple location. we visited the one at St Marks, outdoor seating wasn't available until later on in the day (forgot what time), otherwise its take out only. You would order and just wait inside for the items to pick up.",0
"I'm not really sure how to rate this restaurant. The service doesn't come close to matching the food, and the ambiance doesn't match either. I ordered a Patron margarita (  new go to). Server comes back and says we don't have Patron but we do have Don Julio, I asked her what other tequilas you have and she was clueless. They also tried to take the whole order at one time drinks to dessert. Thought I was on Mott street or my local place. Not a high end dining restaurant. The food was very good though. We had the recommended duck and it was excellent. The Whole sea bass was peculiar but ok( a little dry for my taste). The accompanying sauce was excellent.It's not worth a second trip for me I'd rather spend $150 less on Mott street and leave with a smile rather than trying to figure out a place. I decided on 3 stars based on food only after writing this. And I'm being generous",0
"The Smith is a decent restaurant that offers a reliable meal. The staff are unfriendly and rude at times, but the food is solid. The only downside is that it can be quite noisy inside, so be prepared to raise your voice to be heard.",1
"We visited La Chula and absolutely loved it! The atmosphere is fun and inviting, and the food was delicious. The chicken nachos were especially fantastic - fresh, well-seasoned, and generously topped with toppings. The grilled jalapeño were also delicious, but we recommend biting them into small pieces to avoid getting too spicy. The elote (corn on the cob) and esquites (corn off the cob in a cup) were also great, and we were able to enjoy them as snacks after our meal instead of waiting for our meal to come. We would definitely recommend La Chula to anyone looking for a delicious and fun meal.",1
"I have been here twice. The first time it was kind of empty and Ryan's was just a nice quiet place to enjoy a beer. The music was good and we played some darts. The second time was for a private party upstairs. Wow. The service was fantastic, it had its own bar, and I might add it had its own restaurants. Everyone loved the photo booth. The bar had twinkle lights but our group also decorated it for the party. There was food, but I'm not sure if the bar arranged that, or the host. It was a great place to host a private party of about 45 people. As I was leaving, I was quite surprised to see how packed the downstairs bar was, and great music was creating a good vibe.",0
I tried the sampler Mac and cheese. It was $17 and was a decent portion. Definitely heavy given what it consists of. I was very excited to try it due to me loving baked Mac and cheese but honestly I think it is overpriced. The different Mac and cheese didn't feel like anything too special and I think the best ones are just the simpler ones. It's not worth it due to the price and the flavor. It's a one and done for me.,0
"I've been here once and ordered a few times within the past month or so. I like that they have an outdoor dining and a fair amount of lunch specials. I ordered their diniguan during their lunch special and it was soooo delicious! I am so grateful to have a place for dinuguan that will not require me to go all the way in Queens.I've also ordered for delivery twice so far for my work lunch and got their platter! Their platter consists of rice and two dishes to choose from. I chose the pork (belly) inihaw and longanisa with my rice. It was delicious! It was interesting that it was loaded with the dish and not enough rice but I cannot complain because I love the ""ulam"" portion. I ordered via Yelp and my order was on time so I am grateful.My second order was not a platter. I ordered their beef sinigang and it was deliciously on point! I can confirm that their sinigang has amazing sourness that Filipinos can approve and want for their sinigang. I love that it comes with a long 'sili' so you can easily alter this soup to ""spicy"" just by breaking it into the soup. I look forward to coming back to try more of their menu.",0
"I stopped by Wah Fung No 1 Fast Food for lunch today and I was really impressed. The plate of chicken or pork with rice and cabbage is a great deal at only $5, and the food was really good. I didn't try anything else on the menu, but I'm definitely going back. The line was pretty long, but it moved pretty quickly. I recommend stopping by if you're in the area.",1
"Wok Wok is one of my favorite restaurants in the city! Been here numerous times and the food is consistently good. Came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend at 6:15pm and the space was already starting to fill up! I ordered the Hainanese chicken with chicken flavored rice and my boyfriend ordered the white curry laksa. The Hainanese chicken came with a delicious chili sauce and the rice was very fragrant. My boyfriend loved his laksa; the broth was very flavorful and had a good level of spice. All their menu items are well priced and won't break the bank, leaving you full and happy (: Definitely stop by if you're in the area! As a tip, depending on what the restaurant is offering that day, if you check in through yelp, you can get a free appetizer or a free thai iced tea! And if you message Wok Wok Southeast Asian Kitchen on messenger, the restaurant offers constant deals! Check it out!!",0
"I would only come here for their soup dumplings, as the noodles on many of their dishes were undercooked and had a raw taste to them. The pork and crab XLB were both great, but I was disappointed with the lack of flavor in the soup dumplings. The veggie lomein was also decent, but the wonton noodles were terrible. The veggies were nice and crispy, but the noodles were overcooked and had a bland flavor.",1
"After visiting Times Square, we were in search of a place to grab a decent meal away from the madness and close to Grand Central; burgers, steak and beer required. We found The Perfect Pint and stopped in. We so wanted rooftop dinng, but were told they could not accommodate our party of 6. Total bummer.There was some covered outdoor seating for smaller parties.Just a few larger tables in front of restaurant by entrance, but we made do. The place was full and lively. Host who greeted and sat us could not answer any of the menu questions we had and he did not bother to find out. Odd.Loved the Irish options on the menu-including the special of an Irish breakfast served all day! And so many beer choices!Our waiter was friendly and accommodating, taking drink orders soon after we were seated. However, he was also the bartender and became increasingly busy at the bar as the evening progressed. We had to go up to bar to request additional drinks and dessert and check. We ordered wings for an appetizer which all enjoyed. For entrees: Surf and Turf, Gaelic Burger with slaw, Bangers and Mash, 2 kids burgers. All of our dishes were very good and well presented. Gaelic Burger cooked perfectly MR, Cole slaw and fries good. Steak also perfectly cooked and flavorful, seafood great. Bangers and Mash hit the spot. All decent portions at reasonable prices.The music was pretty loud and it was difficult to carry on a conversation. A solid place to grab a drink and decent food far enough away from the crowds.",0
"There was really no room to move around at the tables, and it was really difficult to sit down without knocking into someone else. The enclosed patio seating was nice but it was very hot inside and too cold without the space heaters on. The staff was very friendly and did their best to switch on and off the space heaters, but it was still really uncomfortable. The oysters were really good and the seafood selection was excellent, but the side dishes were not as good as I had hoped. The roast cod was delicious but it was a small serving for a main dish. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were also good, but the carrots, cauliflower, and snow peas were a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, the food was great but the atmosphere was not. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Grand Central Oyster Bar was really lacking in all areas of the food, drink, and service. While the setting is really beautiful, the food didn't live up to the standards set by the rest of the restaurant. The service was quite lacking, as we had to keep asking for refills and our food came out quite slowly. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Pho Bar! The atmosphere is casual and the service is friendly. The food is of high quality and it definitely comes out in the taste. The beef used in the Pho was super fresh anddelicious. The broth was pretty legit. The oxtail Pho was super tender and full of flavor. The wings were just ok and could have used a little more sweetness. Overall, I would highly recommend Pho Bar to anyone looking for a great Pho meal.",1
"I'm a big sucker for dessert in any shape of form, so Spot was an obvious go-to in NYC. I mean, an all-dessert cafe is living my childhood dream!Even though everyone raves about their matcha waterfall (which looks like a lava cake but with matcha), we went for the coconut monkeybread. It is one of their seasonal Fall '18 desserts and the only one that is vegan. The monkeybread is served in a little skilled and is so yummy! Coconut milk ice cream really compliments the Thai drizzle and the hot base - very tasty! They offer a similar dish with cookie crumbs and marshmallows, but I imagine it being slightly overwhelming. That said, one dish was more than enough for the two of us (who am I kidding, I ate most of it!) so make sure to share.The one thing I didn't like is the cafe itself - wayyyyy too small and looks rather like a to-go boba shop :/",0
"Call me crazy - I'm not a huge fan or pizza but when I heard the hype of Emmy Squared, I knew I had to try it. I was not disappointed! The thick crust Detroit style pizza is delicious. We got two pizzas - the Big Ang (vodka sauce, ricotta, meatball, banana pepper) and the Hot Chicken (hot chicken, white sauce). I personally wasn't a fan of the Hot Chicken, but the Big Ang was to die for! I loved the vodka sauce plus ricotta mix - it was so flavorful. Our waiter was really awesome too. I would suggest reservations if you go on Friday or the weekend since it is a pretty tiny place.",0
"I visited Playa Betty's last week and was impressed with the level of service they were providing. They had expanded their seating area out into the street, which was great. They also had menus available for those who wanted to avoid waiting in line. The paloma I had was delicious and the guac was also amazing. The tacos I ordered were also great. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal in a safe environment.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The cocktails were delicious, the vibe was cool and the food was fantastic. The grilled foie gras was my favorite dish, it was so good! The sashimi was also fresh and delicious, and the veggies were crunchy and delicious. I will definitely be back!",1
"The Steakeasy at Mel's Burger Bar is a cool little spot with a great atmosphere. The food was good, but the cheesecake was a bit of a letdown - it was sour and didn't taste great. I recommend checking it out if you're in the area!",1
"Overall, this restaurant is delicious, with some great dumplings and pork. I'm unfortunately sad to hear that it's closing down, but hopefully they will come back in some form!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was excellent - especially the naan pancake with curry dip and the Indian mee go reng. The only downside was that the serving size was a bit small for the price. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"I had this place bookmarked for a while. Even though I already picked up lunch elsewhere, I happened to pass by and decided to order a few rolls since I'm not in Chinatown often. When you go inside, they are not going to acknowledge you. They seem very busy, with most of their orders coming in via phone. You just have to go up to the counter and tell them what you want or else you're just going to be standing there forever. I had the large pork roll (added egg) and curry fish ball roll. I really liked the pork one, but I thought the curry one was just basic. But I did like the overall texture of the rolls. We didn't eat them until maybe about an hour later, and the consistency held up - it didn't turn to mush or anything.There are a few items available that they don't have officially listed on the menu - like sesame paste, almond paste, and one of my faves - plain rice roll with peanut and hoisin sauce. So I know what I'll be ordering next time. (by the way, if you get a large order of anything, that should be enough to fill you up since rice noodles are filling overall). Next time, I'll just make sure to call ahead since each order takes about 15 minutes to make.",0
"I wasn't aware of their location on Lafayette Street, which is incredibly convenient for me. I was super hungry when I got here, and ordered four tacos (all for meee)! Who could have predicted it would end up being far too many? The carne asada and pollo tacos over here are all really good, and though they might end up being a little pricier than elsewhere, they will sate your hunger for sure.",0
Take out pizza got soggy by the time I got it to the office. Taste is good  n fresh. Reheats nicely.,0
It's great to find places that vegans and non-vegans can enjoy together!  I had a vegan slice and the vegan mozzarella sticks and both were great. Indoor and outdoor seating plus byob!,0
"I'm not a pepperoni fan (aware it's a sin in the eyes of most foodies) so I stuck with Neapolitan slices of the fancy prince pizza. These are pretty classic slices with house marinara and fresh mozz. The sauce for sure has a bit of tang (the good sweet one!) and the slice has a decent flop. Despite a bit of flop, the crust is perfect. Love this slice so it's a solid 8.8/10 for me!",0
"Jiangnan is a terrible restaurant. The food is bland and tasteless, and the atmosphere is nothing like the photos online. The service is okay, but the waitress is not very knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, we would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I feel like there's been a lot of hype around Amelie lately so I was eager to come. My partner and I wanted somewhere casual yet chic for our anniversary dinner and decided on Amelie because of its wine list and small plates options. We particularly enjoyed the roasted cauliflower and were pleasantly surprised by how light the ravioli was (don't skip the truffles!!). Crème brûlée was a great end to the dinner- thin, crunchy top with the brûléed bananas underneath kept this traditionally heavy dish sweet but not satiating. The service was great too - our servers and bussers were very helpful! Would definitely return.",0
"Overall, I thought Sonnyboy was a decent brunch spot. The smashed avocado and Hotcake were both large and tasty, and the blueberry sauce on the Hotcake was excellent. My only complaint is that we had to wait a long time for a table, and our name was taken off the waitlist once we arrived. I would definitely consider returning to Sonnyboy in the future.",1
"I was looking for a good lunch special deal for Korean BBQ and this location popped up first thing on Yelp. I guess Yelp has a good grasp on my taste because I loved it here! I had the short rib and spicy soup combo for $13. There are combos as cheap as $9 if you choose those with bulgogi.The spicy soup pretty much looked and tasted like a mini jigae with a generous amount of tofu and some veggies (minced onions, I think). Both the soup and marinated meat tasted awesome. You will get a bowl of rice and a bunch of banchan (appetizer small dishes), so you will be full for sure. It's a little confusing to get to Jongro, but if you enter through the building labeled ""22"" (it looks nothing like a restaurant), go straight to the elevator and go to the 2nd floor, you'll arrive at the restaurant. Maybe because of this obscure location it wasn't so crowded during lunch time. I appreciated that the staff was super attentive and kept my table clean and banchan ready to eat for the whole time.I am curious about the cold noodle soup which I see a lot of good review. I'm excited to go back another time and try it!",0
"Overall, I found this restaurant to be unenjoyable. Our reservation was for 7:00pm and we were seated at 8:15pm, which was 15 minutes later than our reservation. The hostess was smug and unhelpful, and the atmosphere was very sterile. The food was delicious, but it took a long time for things to slow down and the waiter was very busy. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"This place is conveniently located right outside MSG, and has a nice outside patio upstairs. They have a very limited selection of beers and their drinks are just okay. Unfortunately, the tacos I got were pretty underwhelming from a flavor perspective. The chicken was a bit dry and the toppings were sparse. Overall, it seems like a joint that is there to milk money after sporting events. The staff was polite though.",1
"I had a really good meal at this restaurant last night. I started with the appetizers, which were both very good. The eggplant Parmesan was especially good - it melted in my mouth and had a perfect proportion of sauce and cheese. The prosciutto was also good, although I would have liked it to be a little thinner sliced. For my entree, I had a pasta dish with veal and mushroom sauce. It was rich and very meaty, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The portion was also large, which I was pleasantly surprised by. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. My friends at the table had similar positive experiences, and all of them said that the food was quite charming as well. While it's a bit expensive, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Total bummer that my favorite place for soup dumplings was closed for renovations. But this was a pretty ok runner up. The scallion pancakes were yummy as was the sauce that accompanied them. The soup dumplings here were tasty but slightly too big. The point of the soup dumplings is to fit the whole thing in your mouth (and the ones at the other place -insert sad-faced emoji-fit perfectly) so that when you bite into it, the soup doesn't go everywhere. But, the service was very attentive. They treated us like we were celebrities. So, thumbs-up!",0
"Dallas BBQ is a great place to go for barbecue! The food was delicious and the service was great. The space is big and it has good music playing. The sliders we ordered were great, but the entrees were my favorite part. My boyfriend got the combo dish which was baby back ribs, steak, and chicken accompanied by a square of cornbread and a salad. He absolutely loved it - the meat was tender, juicy and delicious and you really get a lot of food for a great price! I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious!! The barbecue sauce they use is more sweet than smoky (but still delicious!) and the meat was perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend Dallas BBQ to anyone looking for a great barbecue experience.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at this restaurant! The bread of the banh mi was so good - it was crunchy and moist at the same time, and it really added to the overall taste of the sandwich. The meat was also really good - it was thick and full of flavor, and the cilantro, veggies, and cucumber all held their crispiness and crunch. However, I did find the sauce to be a bit mild - it wasn't really spicy at all, and for those looking for a really intense spicy flavor, it may not be the best option. But overall, I thought the portion sizes were great, and I was able to finish the sandwich the next day.",1
"Came here with my dad last Saturday and we're both lactose intolerant, so we were pretty excited to try this spot. I got the Strawberry Bellini to drink (not too sweet, just right). Then to start, we shared the Impossible Meat Polpettine (which had a great spice mix, and tasted like the real thing) and the Portobello Carpaccio (with a delightful dressing). Then for the entree, we shared the Rigatoni with Impossible Bolognese (which also tasted legit) and for the first time in years, we were able to get an Alfredo (also delish). Don't leave without dessert! We shared the tiramisu, and it was def not typical, but it was also definitely delicious.",0
"Walked past this place many times and never really was intrigued to pop in. In my quest to try GOOD CHICAGO PIZZA, this place popped up many times. Overall, not really impressed. To me it's basically a glorified Sicilian mini pie with a crispy cheese edge. If this is what pizza in Chicago tastes like, I would much rather have good NY pizza. I had the vodka and the house special... the sauce was decent and the overall flavor was alright. I would much rather eat the mamas too pizza much more balance in the taste and quality. All in all, I'm glad I tried it but I definitely wouldn't be a repeat visitor unless I was in the neighborhood and this was one of the limited available options.",0
"I had a great time at Mercado Little Spain! The little mini-exhibition on Spanish food on the mezzanine before you descend into Mercado Little Spain was great. I think Chef José Andrés did a great job selecting which elements to showcase in the food hall; there were a lot of regional specialities including Valencian paella to Andalusian gazpacho to Mallorcan ensaïmada. I particularly enjoyed the patatas bravas ($8), which according to a staff member was one of the more popular kiosks. The fried potato cubes smothered in a creamy aioli and spicy tomato sauce are an excellent choice for groups, as is the zucchini coca ($16) which comes generously drizzled in olive oil. The bacon and goat cheese added some great savory depth. The gazpacho clasico ($6) is also a great choice if the potatoes or flatbreads sound too heavy. It's refreshingly cold, creamy and garlicky.

I haven't yet been able to try the restaurants but will definitely return to do so.",1
"**this review is for delivery via Caviar App**i ordered the regular pork soup dumplings, the spicy pork soup dumplings, and the chicken soup dumplings, as well as an order of beef noodle soup. i liked the spicy ones the best, followed by the chicken ones. the beef noodle soup was not very good - i thought the noodles were overcooked and not the noodles that were supposed to be in a beef noodle soup, kinda reminded me of egg noodles or spaghetti?? broth was very sweet. not a fan.delivery took a while, so everything was lukewarm when i received them. would give this place another shot if given the ability to stop in and sit down to eat, rather than order delivery. delivery took way too long and the soup dumpling skin was a bit soggy.",0
"- Cocktails and non alcoholic drinks, 5. - Prawn toast, 5. Wonderful mix of flavors and textures.- Grilled shrimp, 2. A bit off like it wasn't fresh.- Beef tartare, 4. Well executed.- Ssam ... I guess the steak came with a bed of greens and I spotted a fish on the menu but it ultimately felt like there was no actual ssam at the Ssam bar? Was disappointed given I had been looking forward to something that was more doing the lines of the pork belly photos uploaded by other reviewers.- Dessert included semifreddo and deconstructed cheesecake. Was really craving bingsu (shaved ice)...Service is a bit slow and inattentive but no dings for that. It's tough out there and not unusual since the pandemic hit. Should've checked the menu before heading over. Turned out I was craving a lot of stuff that was on past menus but no longer available.",0
"DELICIOUS!!!  Lena's Italian Kitchen opened in Oct. 2020, and it's Take-Out.  This location is on 2nd Avenue, between East 61st and East 62nd Streets.  They have another location in Murray Hill.  Here's what I've tried, so far, and all of it has been delicious :Soups: Pasta e Fagioli, and Stracciateella. Both yummy good. See photos.Salad:  Market Salad has lovely mixed greens, dried cranberries, walnuts, red onion, goat cheese, and a great balsamic vinaigrette. Love this! Entree:  Eggplant Parmigiana . Generous portion. It was so good, It was so delicious, it was challenging to try and not eat all of the generous portion.  I wanted to stop eating so I wouldn't feel overly stuffed.  I can hardly wait to buy it again. I did have a little left and enjoyed it next day with the Market Salad.   I have ordered the Eggplant Parmagiana several times already (came back here to edit review). IT IS SO DELICIOUS.  All the food here has been great! There is a nice Lunch Special that I look forward to trying soon. It says ""Pick-A-Pair"" on the Menu (see photos) For just $13, you can select a Soup, or Salad, and a Half-A-Hero.  Salad/Soup/Half Hero. ***Both selections CANNOT be made from the same section*** Lunch special available UNTIL 4pm.  The lunch special is available Monday through Friday.  It is not available on weekends, but the rest of the menu is, and it's yummy good. I'll post photos of the menu. There are side orders too, like veggies, or side pastas.",0
"*This is for delivery order. Have been wanting to try this place for a while since we live across the street from it so decided to do delivery tonight when my husband was craving pizza. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype, perhaps it had something to do with delivery but when we received our food it was already cold (and we literally live one block from the restaurant...) so we had to reheat everything....What we ordered:- Arugula Salad - overpriced and not very flavorful for being a very simple $15 salad.- Tre Pie (on cauliflower crust with half mushrooms & brocolinni) - perhaps it was the cauliflower crust but it was soggy and reheating it in the microwave just made it worse. Not that flavorful either for having 3 sauces! Definitely bummed because I had read good reviews- Vodka pizza w/ sausage - my husband got this and liked it though I didn't try it! - Chicken fingers - once heated, these were good. Pretty standard chicken strips but yummy nonethelessThe pictures definitely made everything looks appetizing though. Might give it another try in person but did not have a great first experience and would definitely not do delivery again.",0
"I was extremely hesitant to try this shop, but I did it. I have seen mixed reviews on the steam buns and was curious, and decided to give it a try. This business has the longest name ever lmao!This business is located at an abandoned mall (very few businesses opened), East Broadway Mall on the lower level tucked to the side. Looks very run-down. They have a newly updated menu, but with no description for each food item, so you don't know what's inside. We tried asking the worker, but they don't really speak English.We ordered:Small steamed buns (6 pcs) $4Steamed dumplings (8 pcs) $4Total $8, so cheap!! The pork steamed buns were pretty good. The bun was very soft, but the pork filling was on the saltier side. Need water! The steamed dumplings had pork and chives in it. The dumpling skin was very soft. Pork was tasty. The dumplings were loaded with more than usual amount of chives, so watch out for your breath. haha! Must eat it with the sweet soy sauce. It made a big difference in flavors. Overall, it was pretty good!I don't know about the cleanliness. I saw a woman wrapping the dumplings with no gloves and mask on =/",0
"Came back for happy hour during COVID season when indoor seating was allowed. Sad to say, compared to the previous times I was here, I was a bit disappointed this time but its not really the restaurants fault. Happy hour is now 4-6pm from Wednesdays to Sunday. Selection of oysters has drastically dropped, and that's obviously because of COVID so can't really blame the place. They only had 4 different types of east coast oysters for happy hour this time. Last time I was here maybe 2 years ago and they had a variety of both east coast and west coast oysters. I really preferred the west coast oysters so it was sad to see that they weren't available this time. Out of the 4 east coast oysters we tried, the EAST BEACH BLONDES were probably my favorite, followed by the blue points. I think the beach blonds were a bit more succulent. Besides the beach blondes, the other 3 tasted fairly similar. Additionally, prices are no longer $1, which of course, I understand because of COVID. Today, service also took quite some time to get the oysters. Realistically, I probably had a 3 star experience but I'm rating it 4 stars cuz of COVID and I hope this lovely fishbar will eventually go back to pre-COVID shape.",0
"The hype for this place is warranted. The lobster rolls are delicious. I like the thin layer of shredded lettuce at the bottom. Lots of chunky lobster. The Jambalaya soup was my favorite. Cheyenne, shrimp, sausage and wonderful creole flavors. Very hearty and very tasty. The Lobster bisque was very hearty as well. Big chunks of lobster and lots of creamy goodness. Service was fast and friendly.",0
"I was walking by this restaurant by accident and I'm glad I did! All of the dishes I tried were pretty good, and there was plenty of each. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough salted fish in some of the dishes. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend this place!",1
"Came here for a company event. The food was great but the service was one star. We shared a bunch of appetizers. My favorite was the smoked eggplant with garlic yogurt, which reminded me baba ganoush. I had the seared greek salmon with cauliflower rice as my main course. It was flavorful. When I asked one of the waiters if the warm hummus (v) with cured ""beef"" pastirma is vegetarian, the waiter gave me attitude and said ""yes it is"". Then I asked him what's the sliced meat on top? He was like ""that's beef"". Then I asked again ""so it's not vegeterian"". We had vegetarian eaters at the party. I had to make sure that they were not eating meat. The menu was extremely confusing because the beef had a double quote and there's (v) next to warm hummus. But clearly, there was sliced meat on top. So how can it be vegetarian????",0
"I had a great time at The Maze! The fashioned was bold and strong, just how I like it. I really like a good simple Old Fashioned cocktail drink, and I think they did a great job. My friend ordered the Lychee-Tini and was very refreshing and crisp. Definitely more on the sweeter side, so recommend it if you want something sweet and easier to drink. The ambiance was great too - great place for group gatherings and socializing with friends. Pretty decor and fun and energetic vibe with lots of tables and chairs available, but we chose to stand by the bars since we didn't order any food. The music will get pretty loud, so very hard to talk sometimes. The price was average and reasonable in the area. Each drink was around $15 to $18. Pretty strong and good quality, so not bad overall. The service was just the typical K-Town bar service, nothing really stands out, especially when it's very busy. I would say do not expect great service.",1
"I came here around 9:20pm on a Tuesday, right before they were closing, so there wasn't much left to choose from on the menu as a lot of items were already sold out. Of the items I did try, I would probably give their food a 3-Star, but the reason this review gets 4 stars is because of the staff! They were helpful despite us being some of the last people in the place. We ordered fries but they said the fries were too dry to serve anymore so they gave us the savory rice cakes instead with some of the fries for free. After our meal, they also gave us free dessert porridge because they were closing anyways. I thought that was very nice and a good touch of hospitality. In terms of the food I got to try- mapo tofu: would definitely skip out on this next time. Didn't taste spicy or anything like mapo tofu I've had before. A little disappointed. Just is savory tofu on rice- Dan Dan noodles: very good! This was probably my favorite out of what we got! Spicy, lots of little meat in there, and chewy noodles- dumplings in chili oil: also good! Exactly what you would expect. Some of the dumpling peels were flimsy and falling off but that may have been because we came in at the end of the day- savory pork rice cakes (dim sum): would pass on this next time. If you don't eat it immediately the outside gardens and it's not super delightful to eat- fries: we got them dry, but honestly were still pretty good. I would imagine they'd be even better fresh. Basically just French fries stir fried with some chili oil- dessert soup: really great, tastes just like how my grandma makes it at home :) not sure if the taste is for everyone, but worth a try. It's a warm dessert soup Definitely going to come back to try their other more popular menu items in the future though!",0
"I've been wanting to try this place out since they opened but their outside dining option has been a crap shoot in the past.  Tonight , 4/14/22, they offered outside dining.  I just wanted to try a cocktail from them and the oysters.  The cocktail I wanted wasn't available ( the salty cat ) so I opted for the Randy Savage.  That was kinda a half star off. I also ordered a half dozen of the choice oysters for the night. The drink was ok and the oysters , well, you can't judge the kitchen on that.  It was the service.  I dealt with 4 workers. Maybe , that's what Sidney's 5 is ? I missed the the 5th ? Anyways , the first sat me down no problem there.  Then I met the order taker - at first , I felt he was rushing me - I could've sworn , as he asked the standard "" hi how are you tonight? "" he added "" and I'm fine , thanks "" or something along those lines unprompted.  Ok. It's a person of let's get down to business.  My drink of choice as I mentioned above wasn't available.  Then I met another person who handed me my oysters. I like when my oysters are described to me.  Nope. All I got was "" New Brunswick "".  I do remember another person coming to serve me but I forget why. I just wish I got to know about those oysters and better service.  And maybe if the outside patio is opened past 8 I'd come try those delicious sounding shrimp toasts and corn dogs and the others mentioned on the menu",0
"What a lovely spot! You choose either vegetarian or vegan, then white or brown rice... and they bring you whatever's on the menu for the day! It was fast, attentive service, not packed-busy, and VERY accommodating. They were clear about separating yogurt sauces for the vegan orderers. My fave was the potato and eggplant dish, but the crispy crackers to start with sauces was great too.They also have vegan lassi with almond milk!",0
"Pink's Mexican Grill is a restaurant that everybody loves, and for good reason. The food is delicious, the drinks are strong, and the service is always friendly. However, on this particular visit, we had some issues. My boyfriend didn't like the chicken because it was mixed with tomato paste, and I was able to tolerate it but it just didn't compliment the chicken all that well. The spicy beef was much better and should've gotten that for our meals. We also got two drinks - Pinks lemonade and the Paolma Pink. They were pretty small but strong. For some reason, it just did not hit the spot. After everything was done, we asked for the check and our server did not even let us know how much it was. He just waited for the card. I thought he was going to tell me the amount but he didn't. He just swiped the card asked me to sign and ran away. I thought that was really weird and didn't appreciate how I wasn't asked if I wanted a receipt or not. Overall, I didn't think this was a great experience and I'm not sure if I would return.",1
"Would have been Four Stars except that we were not seated until 8:40 pm when we had a 7:45 pm reservation (and we arrived right on time). To compound the problem, when I asked about our table at 8:20 pm I was told (extremely rudely) that we simply had to wait until they were ready for us despite the fact that they had several empty tables. We have been to Catch many  times over the years and know there is always a 10 to 15 minute wait, but not like this. Given the disruptions caused by the Pandemic, including lack of staff, I am very sympathetic to restaurant staff, managers and owners. I'm sure they were taking a lot of heat from everyone -- the bar area was packed -- but there was no reason to take their aggression out on a patron simply asking about their table 35 minutes after their reservation. Once we were seated the manager did come to our table to apologize and at the end of the evening he picked up dessert, so a good recovery on his part. After 19 months of the Pandemic I understand that nerves are frayed and that everyone is on edge, but in the same way as it is unacceptable for patrons to take their frustrations out on restaurant staff it is equally unacceptable for the staff to take their frustrations out on their customers. Enough said, the food was very good as always and we will be back.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant during the pandemic of COVID:19. The service was outstanding and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I appreciated the fact that they were still serving customers while following all guidelines. I'm excited to see them back open completely and serve their usual delicious food and drinks. The decor is great, and I enjoyed my drinks. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great experience.",1
"Clarification, my dining experience for Daniel was when they indeed had outdoor seating. As commented on my review by their general manager, they no longer offer outdoor seating. I have never dined at Daniel for indoor seating, but I would expect it to be an improvement overall from my experience. Perhaps I will return for an updated review in the future.",0
"Pretty solid Japanese BBQ with great cuts of meat including wagyu and solid appetizers as well. It's Japanese BBQ not Korean so you don't get the ban Han but the appetizers are very reasonably priced, especially if you get here before 6 pm for HH.  The meats are very flavorful and you don't even need the sauces - but they are there!Some highlights:1. Harami: very flavorful and tender. Definitely a must try!  I was very pleasantly surprised at how tender this cut was. 2. Prime sirloin: Solid sirloin sliced to the perfect thickness. Don't grill it for more than 2 min!3. Wagyu: this literally just melts in your mouth. It is very flavorful and like butter. 3. Tuna volcano: solid take on a spicy tuna crispy rice although it wasn't really spicy.  The rice was perfectly crispy though. 4. Mushroom medley: this was pretty meh - just a blend of mushrooms without any seasoning. 5. Chicken breast: this was also pretty meh - just plain sliced chicken breast. 6. Beef sukiyaki: Very solid rice dish with sliced beef served in a sizzling pot. I only wish they had added more veggies!7. Fried cheese wontons: Solid take on a pretty mainstream staple. The cheese filling included onion chunks which was a nice twist. 8. S'mores: Pretty standard but you do get to grill the marshmallows!9. Mochi: Try the green tea and sesame!Overall the food and service are very solid and it's a fun dinner for groups. You do all of the grilling but they are very helpful with advice on how long to cook each dish and the meat quality is worth it. The HH specials are also pretty nice as it's the same food but at a discount. 4.",0
"Despite being a fan of Texas Christian University football, I didn't have a great time at this bar. The beer selection is okay, but I'm always hesitant to complain about having just one Guinness on tap. The wings were good, but the fries were a bit small for the price. Overall, it's an average pub that I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.",1
"I come here for lunch a decent amount, since my office is so close. I always alternate between the Quinoa Taco salad and the Kale Caesar. -Quinoa Taco: good, but ratios here need a lot of work. There is way too much lettuce, not enough spicy chorizo / tempeh. The vinaigrette is a bit funky so I tend to resort to the chipotle aioli / tofu crema-Kale Caesar: again, ratios need work. This bowl was mostly leaves with a couple of way-overfried shiitake mushrooms, avocado, maple croutons, I forget if there's even anything else since I'm mostly eating leaves. The croutons are very good. I like to add tempeh to this one since it's on the lighter side!-I like that I can fill up on beet ketchup / chipotle aioli near the cashier, because my salads are lacking in flavor due to ratio issues. Chipotle could be less sweet, thoughThis place has potential to be better - the flavors are kind of there, it's relatively healthy... anyway, I'll be back since it's so close.",0
"The food here was okay. The eggs were over-poached and the popover was more like an omelette, but the huevos rancheros were good. I wouldn't come back, but I'm sure some of my friends would enjoy it.",1
"Spicy Village is a small hole in the wall. It has good food with great affordable prices, but they only accept cash and they check for vaccination records at the moment. Their soup dumpling was my favorite. We also got the beef and pork pancakes; the buns were good. And the last dish was the spicy beef hand pulled noodles. I definitely recommend trying it out if you are in Chinatown!",0
"I was pleasantly surprised by my recent delivery experience at this restaurant. I usually order the pad Thai, and it's always a good price for the large amount they give you. The delivery is always so fast! Almost every time, it has come earlier than the anticipated time listed on seamless. The food is always piping hot and tastes very fresh. While I do agree that it's pretty basic Chinese American food, it's an affordable delivery option. I would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"Great service. I like how the outside dining area accommodate the natural trees that were there first. Cool inside and bar or area near entrance. Mushroom ravioli was great as was the Burrata and tomato salad. They were able to accommodate one person's garlic allergy.Nice environment, not as expensive as we expected. It was a quick walk to our hotel. Definitely a good recommendation.",0
"Ok, first of all; have a sense of humor when you walk in the door, these people are funny :)I was craving some pasta carbonara- which has been hard to find here in the states.  This restaurant's menu seemed authentic so we called to make a reservation for an early dinner.  They bring you rustic country bread to start- nice chewy crust and excellent olive oil with onions and such for additional flavor. We split the spaghetti carbonara and the veal saltimbocca, plus had the mushrooms (boiling upon arrival!) to get some extra veggies.  Food was very good- although I thought saltimbocca (in Rome anyway) had prosciutto- this had creamed spinach- still very good.  Owner introduced himself - he's quite a character, said he is from Spain and he gave a bottle of Moscato with their label.  Great, friendly service and we had an amusing evening.",0
"If seafood is your thing, then head to The John Dory for some of the best in town! The cavernous space is perfect for a romantic night out, and the British soundtrack will help set the mood. The seating can feel a bit odd, but if you're willing to get a bit creative, you'll be able to find a spot to sit that's comfortable. The Oyster selection is great, but the real star of the show is the mussels escabeche and fish sticks. Everything was delicious and I especially loved the fish sticks - they're a bit of a classic and they didn't disappoint. I would definitely recommend The John Dory to anyone looking for some delicious seafood!",1
"The price of this food is lowkey a crime. I sincerely regret coming here without checking yelp. If I had seen the yelp review I probably would have been persuaded against eating here. However, I had no data and couldn't connect to the wifi so I guess this will be a learning experience for all those that read this review. To start off the food is meh at best. I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki rice bowl and the salmon was overcooked. The ends of it felt like biting into a rock because it was so overcooked it hardened and had no flavor. Everything else that came with the meal was mediocre. There was cabbage with some dressing that I can't really describe, pickled vegetables, and two cucumbers. The rice was just rice nothing special with that. The cost was $15.50 for all this and it really wasn't that good. The portions were also pretty small. I also go to try the passion fruit black bubble tea. It was bitter and kind of nasty really. I usually like tea flavored things but the passion fruit flavor was just not enjoyable.",0
"I was really looking forward to my meal at this restaurant, but unfortunately it was not as great as I had hoped. We ordered the sisig, crispy rice rolls, and pork belly, and while they were all good in their own way, they were all quite small portions for the price you're paying. The service was also pretty spotty - our waiter forgot our rice and brought it out towards the end of our meal, so we ended up eating plain rice instead of any of the other dishes. Overall, it was just a very disappointing dining experience.",1
I would not recommend Famous Sichuan to anyone. The food is absolutely terrible and the prices are outrageous. I paid $56 for what amounted to a small portion of food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The drink we ordered, oh it's lit, was really cute and well-presented. The music was really good, and the lounge downstairs with hookah and a dj was really cool. The food was good, but not amazing. I definitely recommend the dusse pina colada!",1
"This is a decent before or after game pub and grub. The entrance is funny and the decor is dark when you walk in, but it's actually two floors with a basement. The service was excellent and attentive. They had many tables, so it was easy to find one. The menu was limited, but they had a game day wing special so we went with that and ordered 20. The food was just ok overall. The wings were Hugh in size so that became our entree, and the short rib empanadas were very greasy so less enjoyable. The beer choices were lots on tap or in bottle. Not much else though on the menu. The price was very reasonable for 2 people with a couple of bottles of beer each the tab without tip was only $67.",1
This was such a heavenly meal. The live music very much fit the vibes and the workers were so friendly. The food came out very quickly and was very fresh and hot. There is a wide variety to choose from but I recommend the chicken parmigiana! :) would come again,0
"I still come here often. The food is just delish and the lunch specials make it SO worth it. I've gotten the chicken ravioli = my FAV. If your really hungry then this won't be enough food but its SO GOOD. The burger is amazingly good. The very first time I had it - they added pickles onions on my burger- that was the first and last time i got those type of onions. They were amazing but any other time I've gone they added raw onions. Sometimes I add an egg to the burger and it's super good. I've gotten the chicken caesar salad. I wouldn't get it again, not worth it. Overall, I'll keep coming back. This place is goooood goooood.",0
"I absolutely enjoyed my time at Maze restaurant! The atmosphere was perfect for a late night spot and the service was amazing. The only downside was the small table we were seated at, but it was still manageable. The nachos and pasta were both delicious and I would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"The Tartinery is a great bar/restaurant with happy hour that's definitely worth checking out! The wine is discounted significantly during happy hour, making it a great value, and the soup is delicious. The restaurant is also easy to navigate and is close to other great establishments, like the Oculus. I highly recommend stopping by the Tartinery if you're in the area!",1
"Just like Cafe Cluny, Cafe Luxembourg was great! My husband and I have been to Cafe Cluny a number of times and we always wanted to try out Cafe Luxembourg, we are so glad we did!I forgot to take pictures of everything, but here is a breakdown of the evening.The service here was wonderful! We were greeted right when we arrived and water was brought immediately, the server was also quick to get us cocktails (which is an A+ in my book).We started with the French onion soup, which was extra on the cheese and the flavor was perfect! For our main dishes I had the impossible burger which was fantastic and cooked to perfection. My husband had the Luxemburger and stated that it was over cooked and nothing to write home to mom about.Outside of the bad burger everything was excellent! We will definitely be coming back to try some other menu items.Thanks for a great Friday night dinner!",0
"I think this restaurant has the potential to be much better than it is. The sushi is ultimately fresh, nothing crazy authentic. The quality is good, but the Service ultimately is the reason I have to give this restaurant three stars. They took nearly 45 minutes to even take our order. While I would consider going back for the food, I cannot say I would be willing to wait this long again",0
"I had high expectations for Indian Accent, but unfortunately everything about my meal was disappointing. The paneer was delicious, but the rest of the food was mediocre at best. The free colored cracker/papadum were extremely stale, and the crispy okra were not crispy at all but in fact soggy and extremely chewy. I would definitely recommend Indian Accent just a few blocks away for a delicious Indian meal.",1
"I walked out of the way to go to this poke shop over closer ones due to the higher Yelp ratings.  I live in LA, so I don't know how Poketeria would compare to other NY poke places, but it was certainly subpar to what I'm used to.  The prices were a little bit higher and the portions were skimpier.  When they scoop the fish, they don't pack it in.  Plenty of airspace in your scoops.   I was also disappointed that the salad was just romaine instead of mixed greens.  The did pack in the scoop of avocado but for $2 THEY BETTER!!  I think it's absurd to charge over $1 for avocado but whatever I paid it.  I usually can't finish a 2-scoop salad at other places but I finished this one and didn't feel overly full.  It wasn't terrible but I've definitely had way better.",0
"I've been craving pizza (happens a lot) and decided to treat myself to some since I had to go into the office. I found Rosella's through the Seated app and saw they have some interesting specialty pizzas, and I do love me a good specialty slice. I ordered for pick up via some site called All Set (as re-directed from Seated). The quoted time was about a half an hour (even for two slices), which I thought was a bit long because typically, the pies are already pre-made, and they just reheat the slice for you. I arrived 10 minutes early but my order was already sitting there (also, nobody greeted me by the way - I had to ask about my order). Both slices were cold - even though I ate it there, so that was kind of annoying. I had the chicken bacon ranch slice and Grandma's eggplant slice. Both were square slices, which was a nice change from the round pies. I usually LOVE CBR but this one didn't do it for me. I think it was the bacon - it was too smoky. Now the eggplant slice isn't something I'd normally order but all the reviews told me that I should and I'm really glad I did. Again, although it was cold, it was still really good. There is a whole piece of eggplant parm on there, complete with ricotta. The sauce was perfect. It had a nice sweetness to it but not overly so. I do like that they jampack ingredients onto the pizza. At least they're not skimpy with that. I was already full after the eggplant slice, so I probably didn't even need to order the CBR.I want to come back only because I've never seen an eggplant parm slice anywhere else before, and I want to try it again, but when it's fresh out of the oven. Next time, I'll skip the ordering ahead and just go there and wait.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The cuisine is Israeli but not kosher, so it's very authentic. The hummus was delicious, and I also enjoyed the shuk salad (vegetarian) as it doesn't have lettuce and I prefer salads with no lettuce. Their ice coffee or latte is also very good. They do have coffee grounds or beans at the restaurant, which is nice. The restaurant can get crowded on weekends and week nights, but it's worth it because the food is so good.",1
"I came here with a friend before my flight to Chicago. I was really amazed by the food photos which led me into coming here. I ordered the wings and giant prawn pancake. The wings were really crispy, but I thought the sauce was lacking a bit. The prawns were huge, but the pancake was not as good as it looked. I felt like the pancake was full of scallions. I was just eating a bunch of scallions instead of the dough or prawns. The environment was really laid back and chill. I don't think I would come back because I thought the price was pretty high for the quality of the food. I really liked the atmosphere, but the food can be better.",0
"I was very disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. We had a reservation for 20 people but didn't get seated until 9pm. Our waiters were very slow and our orders took a long time to come. The hot pot was standard fare - the Mala spicy was maybe a 1 out of 10 on the scoville scale. It did not taste spicy at all. The BBQ was better, but the hot pot was not worth the price. The bill came to about $52 per person with tip, taxes, and a drink or two. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I came to this restaurant for the soup dumplings and they were really good! The serving size wasn't that big but it was enough to feel full. The menu doesn't seem to have other dishes from other Shanghai restaurants I've been to but still a good selection to choose from. The service was quick and the wait staff was nice. Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant.",1
"Overall, the meal was good. However, I wasn't blown away. The bisque was good, but lacked that certain umami richness I look for in a bisque. The steak was impressive--charred on the outside and perfectly tender. The accompanying potatoes and green beans were also good, but not great. Overall, a good meal, but not great.",1
"I have only tried their quinoa bao buns, crab pockets, and their yucca chips and I am thoroughly impressed. Especially with the quinoa bao buns. Typically I prefer meat because that's what I'm used to eating with bao buns. But this is a very nice vegan twist.Their yucca chips are also extremely addicting. Their crab pockets are actually made of real crab, not imitation (or at least it tastes and looks like real crab). I definitely want to come back again. I also love how friendly the employees were and how the business donates a portion of their profits to a good cause.",0
"I had a really enjoyable experience at Carnegie Pizza in New York City. The pizza was definitely delicious - I loved the huge selection of pies to choose from, and the toppings all tasted great. I especially loved the sausage and vodka combination, and the margaritas were also a great touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the city.",1
"Overall, the experience was great - the hostess was super helpful and my order came out quickly. The only downside was that the food was a bit pricey - but considering the quality of the food, I think it was worth it. The fries were really good too - not too salty and just the right size.",1
"Chicken Insider is a Korean fried chicken place. They offer various sauces and sides. I had a lunch special which contains of fried boneless chicken and two sides. I got mine with sweet potato fries and salad. The salad was average. The sweet potato fries were good but they sprinkle sugar on them, which is a little weird. The chicken was delicious, crispy and really juicy and tender inside. I had mine mixed in with soy garlic sauce. They could have done a better job mixing it, since most of the sauce sat at the bottom and soaked through the container. I would still highly recommend the chicken.",0
"I recently visited Omakasa, a new sushi restaurant in town. The restaurant is sleek and modern, with a few traditional Japanese touches. The chefs here are true sushi masters, and they will prepare any dish you desire, including soups and California rolls. Prices are very reasonable, with each dish costing around $70 or $100. The only downside is that Omakasa does not serve any desserts, but the rest of the menu is very enticing. I highly recommend a visit to this restaurant.",1
"It would be easier to eat here if they took reservations but if you don't want any wait time, then it's best to show up when it opens.  I got the Trust Me which was the perfect portion for lunch.  Everything was timed well.  The sushi tasted fresh and came with some good sauces, like ponzu.",0
"Alice's Tea Cup is a decent tea shop in the area, but I wouldn't recommend it for afternoon tea. The tea and food were both ok, but the sandwich wasn't very flavorful and the service was nice but slow. The noise level was alarmingly high, and it was easy to hear everyone else's conversation and dishes clanking and things falling constantly.",1
"Mushroom ravioli $18: the most raved starter by Yelpers. The skin is so thick and large, compared with the small portion of stuffed mushrooms. Essentially you'll be chewing flours. Truffle oil yes, but oily and not flavorful. Ancient grains salad $18: basically a handful of quinoa, 4 thin slices of avocado, a few leaves of veggie on the top. You got the idea.The service was not attentive. High price vs food quality. No wonder the restaurant was quite empty whereas there's a line waiting for table next door at the Italian restaurant Cotta.",0
"I was disappointed with my meal at Agora Turkish Restaurant. The branzino was overcooked and the rice was bland. Overall, the fish itself was good, but I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"The food is pretty good and service is also good.  Noisy pre-theater dinner crowd was very loud so I almost got up to leave but did not.  I had been there once before and have to say food was good again and I'd prob go back.  But $9 draft beer and $14 table wine struck me as too expensive and food was better than good but short of great in my view.  We had the pasta special, chick parm (crispy) and chicken franchaise.  Came with Caesar salad which was good but again unspectacular.Went back and it was nothing short of GREAT!  Branzino fish (whole fish) was among best prepared fish I ever had and the pasta sampler was great-particularly the cannelloni.  My date had chicken Parmesan and it was excellent too.  Breads good and fresh and service was first rate too.  Will definitely return.",0
"Tipsy Shanghai was a decent option when we were short on time and wanted to eat in Chelsea. The front door is a bit of a hazard, as it opens to the seating area near the bar, but the wait wasn't as long as we anticipated. The food was average, but I would recommend it if you're in the area.",1
"We had a great time at Her Name was Carmen. The food was delicious and the service was great. We especially loved the pre fix family style dinner option - it was great value for money. The only downside was that it got very cold often and we had to wear jackets all night. However, the music was great and the crowd was fun. The staff were very friendly. Overall, we would definitely recommend Her Name was Carmen to others.",1
"The chicken sammies are Phenomenal, the cocktails are all unique and tasty, and the snacks are really good, too. We sat for 2 near the front bar right before the kitchen opened at 5pm on Friday, and the food was really great. The cofounders mentioned that they're currently releasing new drink numbers (and menus / menu items) slowly as they open during COVID, and we can definitely see why - all of the numbers we tried were delicious. We especially loved the hot honey sandwich, which I'll definitely get every time. The sauces on the sandwiches were delicious, and the careful design details, quality of the fare, and decor all make for a wonderful (and surprisingly funny) experience. The bus stop outside is convenient, too.",1
"Ordered the Teppen Shio Ramen for take-out and it was delicious even after eating it roughly half an hour later! The broth is so flavorful and the noodles, chasu, and egg perfectly complemented each other too. Really impressed with their take-out and can't wait to go back to try more!",0
"Ippudo's Akamaru ramen was good, but not great. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the noodles had a good bite to them. However, the chashu was a bit disappointing for me. The black mushrooms and scallions were also good, but the chicken karaage was my favorite dish of the meal. Ippudo is a good place to get ramen, but I would not recommend it as the best ramen in town.",1
"A coworker recommended this place and I went online to research it further. I must say the menu, prior to arrival, was ""meh"" on my radar but the reviews seem to be overwhelmingly positive so I figured ""Let's see how this goes"".RSVP made, nice mid week dinner guarantees no crazy crowds. It's easy to get to, just steps from the trains. I liked the ambiance. Staff, friendly and helpful.Bathrooms- Nice.You walk in here feeling like you are about to delighted in ways you can't even Yelp about, and it's all good until you start to eat and realize this food isn't memorable AT ALL.What we had is in the photo. That ""Paella"" everyone raves about? Y'all just need to stop that right now. It wasn't horrible/bad, but it's not even paella. It's paella in the sense that it's in some frying pan but that's where it starts and ends.Brussels sprouts- Well these days we are forced to pay $$$ for brussels sprouts and cauliflower that our parents tried to jab into our mouth when we were just 7yo.  How we have come full circle. Tenderloin- Basic.Oh wait, I did enjoy this fritters thing but sadly only 1 came in the order.We did not have dessert here because it would just be a wasted effort. Instead we walked nearby and got dessert at a random spot which was very tasty and 1/5th the price.End of the meal, my friend basically said we should have just stuck to going for Thai food :)The reputation of Bobby Flay precedes this restaurant. And it's nothing against the place/staff, but the food is regular.",0
"Hard to complain about $1 pizza! It's a great pit stop while rushing to Penn station. The crust is thin and crispy and a slice is nicely packed with flavor! The smell and price will lure you in, just let it happen.",0
"The food here is pretty good, but the servings are a bit large and the dishes can be a bit heavy. The wifi is a nice touch and the space is decently sized.",1
"This is a great little ramen shop that is perfect for a quick meal. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The menu has a variety of options, including chicken karaage and miso ramen, both of which were definitely delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick and tasty meal.",1
"Quick service and the cheap price is the best thing they have going for them, especially if you're on a jury duty lunch break.  Not much seating - a couple of counter spots - so don't expect to luxuriate.  I went with the ""eat and walk"" approach, despite the rain.  Beware, the lady working here will yell at the slightest provocation.  Don't order fast enough, she'll yell.  Try and order 5 dumplings instead of 10, she'll yell, and refuse.  (Despite the fact that an order of 5 is an option plainly printed on their menu.)  All part of the atmosphere, I'm sure, but best to come prepared.",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at BONMi. The staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean. I didn't love my sandwich, but I'm willing to give it another shot and make my own. I would recommend this spot to others looking for a casual lunch spot.",1
"Came here for brunch. The shrimp and grits were good so was the okra and molasses corn bread. The owner, Randy, came out to greet the tables. The only issue that almost prevented me from the 4 rating is the long wait for the food. There were several tables complaining. I suggest they give the tables biscuits or rolls to address the hunger while waiting.",0
"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, my first time at a Bareburger. Was a little confused by all the options on the menu, but we ended up with two different Impossible burgers, the reason we came here. Both tasted really awesome, no complaints about the food. I found out I'm not a big fan of vegan cheese, but that's not the restaurant's fault.We also ordered a vegan mint oreo milk shake which was absolutely delicious (more oreo than mint flavor).Service was great, friendly and fast.Only thing was some other patrons left the door open on a 40 degree day so I had to get up a couple of times to close it but given how inconsiderate and oblivious most people are that's to be expected I guess.",0
"I had a great experience at this new location of the restaurant! The manager, Phillipe, was so friendly and welcoming and the ingredients in my Buffalo cauliflower salad were all so fresh. The new location is also very clean. Only issue was that it was a little loud and hard to hear when they were taking my order, but I understand the Covid precautions are necessary! Overall, I'm happy to see this new location in midtown!",1
Food is delicious but be warned that they are packed to capacity on Friday and Saturday nights with minimal social distancing. They also seemed to be a little overwhelmed when I went. There were about 3 waiters running around and it took a while to get things you needed. Come on a day that isn't packed and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.,0
"*pre covid review* We came to Yakitori TORA while on a weekend trip in New York and it was one of our favorite meals we had. We arrived about 2 hours before close and we were warmly greeted by a woman who seated us right by the window and gave us menus and water. We ordered much more than we ended up take photos of. The food was so beautiful that we would eat it right away and forget to take a picture. Before we ordered she told us that the skewers take a while to cook and asked that we be patient. We completely understood and tried to stagger our orders so that we always had food cooking. Our favorite bites were the beef, chicken skin, Berkshire pork and chicken hearts. Everything was grilled to perfection and had the pure smoke taste of binchotan. We were also seated in an area where we had a great view of the chef grilling our skewers. We really enjoyed our meal and felt that although not every skewer was perfect, that they were all cooked well and had plenty of flavor. We will definitely come here again next time we are in town.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The line was long but service was quick, and the food was delicious! The chicken was tender and moist, and the waffle was fluffy and crispy with a perfect light edge. Their fountain drinks are very refreshing, and I got a refill before I left. The seating is interesting so you have to sort of just catch a seat, but people do come here for brunch so it's usually pretty busy. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"As far as delivery options go when you don't know what to eat for dinner and don't want to cook this wasn't too bad.Fairly cheap, the delivery was quick and polite, and the food as tasty enough. The Greek Salad we received was huge!Also, they forgot the salad dressing and when I called they had it sent over within minutes. That's good service.Not sure why there are so many bad reviews here. Maybe I just got lucky. I'd give them another try.",0
"Overall, I thought this restaurant did a decent job. The food came quickly and tasted pretty similar to what I'm used to at other Chinese restaurants. Some of the highlights for me were the cumin beef and orange chicken, both of which had great flavor. However, the dumplings were a bit disappointing - they were chewy and didn't have a lot of flavor. Overall, I had a enjoyable meal here.",1
JeJu is a restaurant that I would highly recommend if you're looking for a delicious and luxurious meal. The truffle bibim myun noodles were a highlight of my meal and were absolutely delicious. The pearly box in which the truffle was stored was a beautiful addition and made the experience even more special. The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a great chew to them. The sauce was rich and creamy and tasted great with the noodles. I would definitely recommend JeJu to anyone looking for a great night out.,1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was friendly and the food was great. I especially loved the grilled corn appetizer, which was reminiscent of elote but I wish they had cut the kernels from the con as it was really difficult to eat cleanly. The japanese potato salad was also very nice and the thin slices of pickled cucumber really added a nice balance to the rich mayo-heavy (is it mayo??) whipped potatoes. The stars are always the temaki. I feel like these have gotten smaller (but my memory isn't the greatest) since I was last here. The best for me were the xo scallop and the tuna poke. The tomato and smoked salmon was saltier than I remember. Overall, I had a great meal!",1
"I had a wonderful experience at Mint Kitch! The service was great and the food was delicious. I love their no straw policy and the environment friendly decor. They also have a great student loyalty program - for every 5 meal students have here, they will fund a healthy meal for a family in need. I highly recommend this place!",1
"Went here for Wednesday lunch around 12:15 pm. There were around 15 people ahead of me, but the line seemed to move fast. Took me around 20 minutes to get out of the door with my tacos. The process starts with first putting the order at the register and getting a receipt for it. Then you wait till it's your turn at the kitchen counter, where the tacos are prepared and ingredients are put in front of you. You can let us the preparer know your choices.The tacos are not that huge, I had ordered three of them, that seemed a good portion. I like the taste beef taco more than the chicken, but both were decent. This would be one of my go to places in the city, when I think of getting tacos for lunch.",0
"The food was really good here! Our table was seated quickly and the hostess was very nice. The atmosphere was cool and relaxing and the salads were especially delicious. I especially loved the chopped salad with salmon - it was delicious! The chicken sandwich was also great, with baby arugula, grilled red onions, and tomato aioli. The fries were perfect and the service was consistent. This is definitely a place we'll be adding to our lunch list!",1
"Love is a great restaurant with great food and great service. The interior design is modern and sleek, and the location is perfect. I really enjoy cooking at home, and this is a great place to do it - the kitchen is very well-equipped. The short ribs and ribeye beef we ordered were both amazing - the short ribs were so juicy and delicious, and the ribeye beef was fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend Love to anyone looking for a great restaurant experience.",1
"Although I found the food here tasty, most other stuff was lacking. The employees seemed like they would rather be anywhere else. The hostess only stared daggers, wordlessly leading us to a table. For such a beautiful space, you don't experience an ounce of friendliness, you're simply a body taking up space. The menu uses words like ""entree"" where in reality you're getting a tapas-sized plate. Expect that each person will need to order an appetizer and an ""entree"" to feel full - and this is coming from a person that eats little and almost always takes home leftovers from restaurants. It is too bad that this place was so disappointing, as I had been looking forward to trying it. I did find the food to be delicious - ropa vieja was solid, and the ceviche was tasty, although light on fish and heavy on mango. Alas unfriendly service, messed up orders, and minuscule portion sizes for sky high prices get points taken off.",0
"Aesthetic inside was cute and it seemed like a very popular place for drinks. We waited quite a bit for a table for 3, but we didn't have any prior reservations, so it was expected. They require you purchase food if you want to be seated at a table, so we ordered Korean army stew. The broth was pretty good, but I'd say avoid it unless you're willing to pay $40 for something you could make at home for about $5. In Korea town, I'm sure you could find something more worth your while. We ordered 3 pitchers of yogurt soju (which were actually just large mason jars), which were very sweet and refreshing, but unsure how much of it was actually alcohol. The drinks were good, food was average, good vibes, but not worth the money in my opinion.",0
"Plan B is a great place to go for a drink with friends. The interior is modern and clean, and the music is a little loud but not too loud. The drink prices are reasonable, and the cocktails are delicious. The service can be a little awkward at times, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend Plan B to others.",1
I absolutely love Bao by Kaya! The food stand in the Urbanspace at 570 Lexington is always fast and delicious. The staff is always friendly and they give you your order within minutes. My go-to is the combo of 2 bao and popcorn chicken. My favorite bao is the pork belly one so I usually get 2 of those. The combo is around $11.90 and definitely worth it. Definitely consider this place when you are around Urbanspace and want a quick and tasty eat.,1
I visited the MK restaurant recently and found it to be just as wonderful as every other location I've been to. The food was delicious and the service was great. I especially love the turkey BLT with avocado on a croissant - it's my go-to order! I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a delicious meal.,1
The restaurant was pretty and the service was quick. The food had good flavors. I ordered the chicken and it had good flavors. I would come back to try a few other items.,1
"I absolutely loved everything at this restaurant! The outdoor service didn't benefit from the street smell, but it's Chinatown and we got over it as soon as the food arrived. Our servers were friendly and attentive, which was nice, and they seemed both surprised and amused by how much food I ordered for two people. Little did they know that prior to that we had just had soufflé pancakes, too!

I particularly enjoyed the soup dumplings (we had crab and pork), dim sum dishes, spicy oil wontons, and scallion pancakes etc. However, I was disappointed by the seafood noodles because they were not what I expected. I will be back to eat most of these items and more noodle soups and such!",1
Ordered the hotpot beef noodle soup 火锅牛肉面 and it was excellent 5/5. Comparable to beef noodle soups I've had in China. Beef was very tender and noodles were thin with great texture. 4/5 overall though since my friends thought their items were fine / good but not A+. Soup for the mushroom chicken noodle soup was lackluster. Inside looked very nice.,0
"PURCHASED: 3x TecateTOTAL: $20 PROS: + View: The view is nice. It has 3 different faces of the sky. There is some obstruction of bigger buildings. However, it is not that big of a deal. I am only speaking out CONS: - View of all of Manhattan: It is not really that this is a complaint. It is that the location has a lot of nice big buildings close and up front. Different rooftops have different types of views. This one in particular is good for hanging out at or going on dates. If you want a sick photo, I would suggest another spot. Though, it still makes for sweet photos up close. IMPRESSION:Date friendly. squad friendly. business friendly. This spot certainly is a strong 4.5 -- STRONG SPOT.",0
"Taste: best SE Asian food I've had (granted it's one of the cuisines I don't eat often, but definitely better than your average Thai restaurant)Value: medium-priceyFrequency: I ordered from here back to back in the past two days... so good given what's out the right nowRecommended dishes:* Naan pancake with curry dip (don't remember the name). Delicious appetizer, just wished the serving size was large for $9.50* Indian Mee Go Reng with beef: very good fried noodles, beef is cooked over a crispy flake sort of batter. Uniquely served with spicy curry dressing* Laksa: very well executed, I like the sponge tofu. Recommend choosing the crispy wonton instead of chicken. I like the mee go reng betterVery happy that I discovered this restaurant. Can be described as gourmet SE Asian comfort food.",0
"Tasty meal, good drinks....why 2 stars? Well..... the special of the day was a red snapper for 2 + 2 sides...ok sounds like a good dinner let's do it! Guys it was a huge fish! This was a dinner for 4 or 5! Then come to find out it was $150, which it was worth, but please next time tell the people it's for the table! Not for 2 ladies! Even the sides were family size! Then we ask for the massive amount of leftovers to go & they bring us boxes to pack it ourselves! You want me to pay $150 & then pack it myself...ummm ok well 2 stars it is. Oh wait I forgot to mention the automatic 18% service charge included! This is the first time in Manhattan in all my years that I've seen gratuity added. I understand covid times, but I'm not a dead beat I would of course tip. We only ended up here because Anassa was packed & honestly we won't return.",0
"I've eaten here a couple of times and it's usually pretty empty or at least half empty on a weekday lunch, though i'm hoping this isn't the case during other times. It's decorated a bit like a french bistro with small wooden tables, white decor everywhere with a dark wood bar. I don't love the appetizer sampler plate, as the fried items on the sampler are a bit tasteless. The dips are all solid, but not the most remarkable. The eggplant is really nicely pureed, but I've definitely had better. The grilled lamb sausage with hand cut fries is good. The lamb sausage is thinly sliced, pink in color, a little reminiscent of pepperoni, lightly citrusy, crispy, nicely done, not really lamb-y. The handcut fries are perfectly crispy. It's served on a little hot skillet. As for mains, I've tried and just fallen in love with each of the following: The manti, miniature raviolis stuffed with ground beef in a garlicky yoghurt sauce. They're addictively good. The ali nazik: yoghurt and eggpplant puree on the base which is luscious and creamy, topped with really flavorful",1
Neat Taiwanese restaurant on St. Mark's :) came here for the $50 for 2 hotpot which is pre-made for you and seasoned pretty well. Service was great! Outdoor seating could use a little improvement though.,0
"Avenue Downtown is a great new restaurant that I had the pleasure of visiting last week. The space is incredibly well designed - there's a large bar area, a massive dining room, and plenty of seating down a slightly more private hallway that might lend well to an intimate date night. The walls are brick and the whole place has a very upscale-rustic feel to it. I had the opportunity to try a number of small bites including caprese skewers (phenomenal), tiny pizzas with anchovies, fig and prosciutto bites, etc. The caprese skewers were by far my favorite and I thought the olive oil that was drizzled on top was to die for. We had the opportunity to try a number of drinks as well. While I mostly stuck to wine, I gotta give it up for the bartenders - they were incredible efficient and nice, and clearly knew what they were doing with managing a crowd.

It's unclear whether this will be a busy/trendy new bar downtown or more of an upscale dinner place, but either way, it will do it well. Can't wait to return with friends!",1
"I was so disappointed with the food at this restaurant! The music is great, the ambiance is nice, and the service is good, but the food was terrible. I ordered the fish, shrimp and chicken tinga taco and the fish had a super fishy taste, the shrimp had an odd taste to it and the chicken was not great. I didn't finish any of the tacos. That's not like me at all! So I definitely wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone.",1
"We ordered for a small party, and got quite a sampler of everything. My guests weren't impressed... their review was that the shop leaned too far into their novelty of the fusions, and not enough into the dish's flavors themselves- citing them as bland and underwhelming. Nobody could see themselves returning or suggesting this going forward. I'm pretty surprised that this place is so well regarded when there are no shortage of excellent dumpling shops around town.",0
Michigan State bar in nyc!!!  A fun place to watch the game.  Drink prices are reasonable.  Goo green,0
"Kbbq here is okay and kinda pricey for the quality (but also.. I get that it's manhattan). After tip and tax it's about $50 per person for very standard kbbq menu items but not much else. (There is a more expensive package if you wanted additional items). I enjoyed the pork jowl and steak the most, brisket was average, but the marinated ribeye had a strange artificial aftertaste and was kinda dry. The corn cheese was also v watery for some reason (prob defrosted?) with little cheese. Also, they barely give any ban chan and only included rice cakes on the classic menu when a lot of other places include items like tofu stew.",0
"This place was amazing! The line moved quickly, which was good because we were hungry. It's a little disjointed, but that's okay because you order at the counter and get a paper ticket, which you then hand over down the line to one of the cooks to make your order. We ordered the quesadilla especial, which is like a fried empanada - get it, you'll be in gooey cheesy heaven. We also got a horchata which was very smooth and not grainy at all! We also tried three tacos, the pollo, carne, and pork. Hands down, the carne asada was the best damn taco I've eaten in my entire life. I do not say this lightly, and I've eaten a lot of tacos (not even counting all the sad late night Taco Bell tacos). The steak was superb and juicy, perfectly seasoned and just exploded with flavor in your mouth. We got it on flour, which I think was a really nice pairing over the corn, but whatever floats your boat! I can't wait to get back here and order 5 more carne asadas and just revel in my life choices.",1
"Made the reservation here via Seated for perks. Had dinner here on a Tuesday night and the place was half empty. I was excited when I saw their happy hour menu goes to 9pm but unfortunately the deal is for bar seating only. Nevertheless we stayed seated where we were and ordered appetisers and one small bbq meal to share between the three of us. The pancakes were nice and fresh but not mind blowing. The jap chae noodles were also nice, but again not amazing. The bbq platter was good with wide selection being offered - Shrimp, salmon and kalbi (and maybe another cut of beef). It came with rice, salad, kimchi and lettuce wrap leaves. The meat platter was served raw and you are asked to cook the meat yourself which was pretty fun. The meat was very well marinated so it was tasty. Service was on the slow slide despite the restaurant being half empty. The check was approx. $50 p/p with tax and tip.",0
"Azalea's restaurant is definitely a hidden treasure, and it's definitely worth a visit! The seafood selection is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. Our waiter was friendly and responsive, and our only regret was that we didn't discover this gem of a restaurant sooner! We both had salads and we both loved them. The crabmeat and avocado salad was especially delicious. The Branzino filet was also very good, and it came with a salad that was perfect. The cheesecake with fresh berries was also a great dessert. All in all, a wonderful experience, and we would definitely recommend Azalea's restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious seafood meal.",1
"I visited the new restaurant located on St. Marks Avenue near NYU and had a really enjoyable experience. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and new-looking. I was able to choose my meat (by the pound) and veggies (by the basket) and there were a lot of different options to choose from. The spicy levels were just perfect for me, with no spice, small (hot enough for me), medium and very spicy. The rice was extra, and the cost was a little higher than Flushing's restaurants (at least the last time I went to the food court). However, the flavors were very similar to those found at the Flushing location, so I would recommend visiting both restaurants to get a sense of the variations. In addition, I thought the price was worth it given the quality of the food. Overall, I had a really great experience and would definitely recommend the restaurant to others.",1
"Overall, I thought the sushi was good. The rice ratio was a bit off, but the sushi were still delicious. The uni ikura don was my favorite though, it was really good at first but after a few bites it started to feel really heavy. The banana chocolate cake was also really good, I was surprised that the portion was so small but I'll definitely order the full-sized cake next time.",1
"I had a really great time at Pinch Chinese restaurant! The decor and menu are really funny and charming, but you still get a cool vibe from the restaurant.

I ordered the chicken soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings and the spicy wontons. I liked the chicken and pork dumplings - the dough was perfect and the filling was really flavorful and moist (a la DTF), but found the spicy wontons to be more of a ""smokey"" / oily taste. I probably wouldn't order them again.

The chicken wings looked really, really good but the waiter forgot to put in our order for our second round of food / drinks, so perhaps next time.

I also got the ""Bartender's Choice"" mocktail - a delicious blend of rose water / green tea / lychee that was great (and not too sweet). My sister got the red cider and thought it was good (though perhaps nothing to write home about).

Overall, I think this place is a solid 4 stars. Come for a date or a good time - the dumplings are top notch and the atmosphere is fun. I would knock of a point or two for the service (they didn't leave",1
"This is a must-go restaurant if you're in the area! The atmosphere is really cozy and cute, while also being elegant. The service is great, and the food is amazing. The portions are perfect for sharing, and the banchan are delicious. I especially loved the kimchi pancake - it was so cheesy and delicious. I can't wait to come back and try more of the dishes!",1
"Pretty good food. We tried three of the signature dishes: pig trotters in spicy pickled mountain pepper sauce, bamboo shoots and shrimp (from dried not canned bamboo shoots - yay), and spicy crab.  All three were pretty good.  I honestly can't tell which I enjoyed the most.Flavors are authentic Chinese but the signature dishes are not cookie-cutter Sichuan dishes you see everywhere.  I liked that it also was clearly less greasy and salty than most other Sichuan places so my digestive system thanks me for that.Really polite service.The only two suggestions I have for the restaurant are:1) add plum juice to the menu.. Really complements spicy food and improves appetite2) maybe a one-off but some of the k-pop or whatever music they were playing was really annoying.  Like the type of music an establishment plays when it wants people to leave..Otherwise good experience - will be back!",0
"Fast, cheap and tasty! I love this place. The small lunch portion is only $4.25 for pork or chicken. I actually opted to get the large pork lunch for $6 so I could eat half and save the rest for later. It also comes with some steamed cabbage. I wish they gave more veggies, but quite nice of them nonetheless. The pork was super moist and tasty and they're nice enough to pour sauce over rice for you...although it could be more flavorful. For the price, I definitely wouldn't complain though.",0
"I absolutely love Pocha 32! It's one of my favorite restaurants in Ktown, especially when it's after 1 am and you're craving Asian drunk foods. I always want to have both savory and sweet dishes at one table, and I have a few go-to's for each:

Savory - soups. The fish cake stew is one of my favorites, but you can't go wrong with any of the soups available. Each of the fish cakes come in skewers, which makes it much easier to pick up (trust me, it's useful). All of the broths have so much umami that I know I can't replicate them in home cooking. The Korean seafood pancake is a great carb-heavy dish to help soak up alcohol. There's also plenty of grilled, stir-fried, noodle, and rice options

Sweet - the deep-fried menu has a lot of sweet sauces. The fried chicken in sweet garlic sauce with French fries is the best! Such a good combination of east meets west. It's not fried with too much breading, and it's much crispier than I expected. Watermelon soju is also an amazing cold drink.

It's a very small but",1
"Came here on a weekday evening for dinner, outdoor seating. Got an al pastor, carne asada, and grilled fish taco. Grilled fish and al pastor didn't have much flavor, and the al pastor had a ton of oil. Carne asada was flavorful and I enjoyed that one. At around $17 post-tax, tacos were pretty small and flavor was just not there.",0
"I needed a quick bite to eat, nothing I had to wait or sit down for. Def a on the go meal. I went with the chicken tender dog. The kiosk to order is super convenient. That chicken tender dog was too good . There are different flavor options , I went with the original tender dog. There are plenty of different options of chicken meals . Chicken is fresh, facility is clean. Enjoy!",0
"I had a great time at Milu! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really peaceful and comfortable. The service was really quick and the food came out really quickly, which was great. I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch or dinner.",1
"I had a really fun time at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really inviting and the staff is friendly and accommodating. I really enjoyed my appetizers- they have a great variety of ""sheep"" that changes with the seasons. The cocktails were also really good. My only complaint is that the prices are a little on the high side, but overall I had a really good time. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun and casual restaurant experience.",1
"We had a great time at Bergdorf Goodman Restaurant! The views of the city were fantastic, and the decor had an old, classic feel that I loved. The afternoon tea was quite pricey at $60 per person, but it was definitely worth it. Our favourite part was the variety of different teas offered, as well as the mini sweets and finger sandwiches that came with it. The restaurant was quite small and we were completely full, so it was a bit noisy, but the service was great and we loved the food. We would definitely recommend reservations for this spot!",1
"The staff was attentive and quick to serve us, but the food had mixed reviews. The eggplant fritters were fresh and the caprese was good, but the pasta w Clams was dry. The rigatoni and orechiatte were average, with nice sauces.",1
"I've been to Madame Vo twice now, and I really enjoy their food. Some dishes I love, and some I don't, but I would give Madame Vo a grade of 3.5 overall. I especially loved the spring rolls, which were very crispy and came with pork and a full shrimp. The chicken wings were also a great choice - they were very flavorful and crispy. I also tried the pandan tea, and it was delicious! It didn't have any sugar, and it was very refreshing. Overall, I think Madame Vo is a great restaurant and I'd definitely come back to try more dishes.",1
"Sangria 46 is a Spanish backyard hidden in Hell's Kitchen's restaurant row. The backyard is very cozy and tables are set far apart from every customers, the grape vines crawl over head and serves as shade for the entire backyard. The clusters of grape fruits are hanging everywhere as well. We started with Sangria made with Cava with some chips and salsa, and found the menu appetizers interesting so we ordered chorizo with onions and crab bites with spicy sauce. At some point Lenin (not sure if he was the manager) harvested some grapes and served it to customers, we thought that was a sweet touch.

We've decided that we will have our dinner there as well since the main entrees looks good for groups. We had another pitcher of more traditional Sangria with red wine and an order of Paella Negro with seafoods, from appetizers, strong Sangria, tasty Paella and great customer service of our server, Lenin, I can see why people are keep on coming back to Sangria 46!",1
"Came here for dinner with 2 of my friends late on a Sunday evening, a few weekends ago. We had more or less missed the dinner rush, so the place wasn't too crowded, and we were seated right away.We decided to share their samosa trio appetizer, their mushroom risotto, and their saag dish. I also got their stuffed paneer lababdar for my main, while my friends chose some other, meatier dishes. The mushroom risotto was delicious, and while I liked both the saag and paneer dishes, I thought my paneer dish had a funky taste to it. My friends loved their dishes, though, so all in all, it was a nice experience and while it's pricier (and a tad fancier) than other Indian places than I am accustomed to, I'd consider coming back if I happened to be in the area.",0
"Patsy's is a legendary name in pizza and so I had to try it. I felt like it had become a little too commercialized recently so not sure if it has the Mom and Pop homemade quality anymore. The round pizza I had was good - the coal fired style gives the crust a smoky flavor and it also had a good chewiness to the dough. The tomato sauce was bright and vibrant with just the right amount of seasoning. The pizza was surprisingly good. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey at $24 for a pizza, but you are paying for the name too. Patsy's passed my pizza test!",1
"Avoid this place at all costs - the chicken is absolutely terrible, the biscuits were cold and gross, and the atmosphere is decidedly unfriendly. Save your money and go to the east village location instead.",1
"Maybe a 3.5 for this one order. I found it on Grubhub in the ""Deals"" section. 7 bucks off. I ordered the seafood Cobb. There is nothing Cobb-like about this salad but for 16 bucks it's a perfectly respectable shrimp salad with avocado and tomatoes and a nice vinaigrette. I also got a large portion of stirfry Asian veggies. 6 bucks. At the deal rate, I'd order again. Not sure I'd order minus the deal when I can spend that much at Match 65. LOVE Match 65. Best salmon benedict and the side of veggies, 7, is better than this (better quality, not as well-done, and more interesting flavor). But for a Grubhub night when you're not feeling well and don't want to eat heavy carb or fattening food, I'm not displeased. I'd try other stuff here but probably go in because delivery took forever.",0
"Solid pizza!Came here on a Friday night and it was very busy and a bit chaotic. I would highly recommend ordering online on their website in advance to reduce your wait time - you can avoid the main line (which wrapped around the block) and go directly to the cash register to pick up your pie. We ordered online as soon as we got there seeing the long line and had to wait ~25 minutes to get our order. A slice of pizza is about $5, so you definitely get more for your money by getting a whole pie.As for the pizza itself, we got the Spicy Spring Pizza, which was delicious. It wasn't really spicy, but the crispy pepperoni added a nice flavor. There isn't really any eating space, so best to plan for takeout.Would recommend if you're in the area!",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty standard, but the pizza was good. I don't think it's worth it to come back, though.",1
"My friend and I came here for her birthday dinner and we had a great time. We were seated immediately (after showing proof of vaccination). You could tell that Maison Pickle is a very popular spot because it was very busy. For starters, we got the garlic and parmesan pull apart bread (you should definitely get this). For drinks, she got the Razzle and I got The Sundress, my friend loved her drink and I loved mine so much that I got two because it was a Friday and I'm a sucker for passionfruit! For our entrees, I got the steak frites and she got the deluxe. Our server did warn her that it's a pretty big sandwich and it was indeed. It was so big that she had to take half of it home (she was able to reheat it in the oven with no problem). My meal was good, the steak could have been a little hotter but other than that, it was good. The mac and cheese was absolutely sinful. The service was on point--our server gave good suggestions and didn't rush us--in these times, we usually can only stay in a restaurant for 90 minutes but I know we stayed longer than that and it felt good to just catch up and enjoy our meal without feeling rushed. I really recommend Maison Pickle for good food, good service and good vibes!",0
"Food was OK, views were nice but nothing like what they have on the website. Make a reservation for sure, it was fun but worth it for the drinks, not the food",0
"Update Update Update!After coming here 2 days straight for breakfast this past weekend, I started liking their breakfast menu more and MORE!!!***H.K.

"Been to Uncle Boons so really just wanted to try Thai Diner's breakfast dishes.Ordered the George's Egg Sandwich to go, welllllll to be honest not sure what's specialty about it. Not really Thai nor wow just a lot of American cheese and bok choy.",0
"The Wilson was a great choice for our bridal shower! The service was amazing and our waitress took such great care of us the entire time. The Brussels sprouts tacos were delicious and I'm not a huge fan of Brussels sprouts. The avocado fries were good, I could've done without them b/c the fried fish sandwich that I ordered for my entree also had avocado in it. The fish was crispy and was a generous portion on the sandwich. The Wilson itself also had a downstairs bar area which would also be great for happy hour or events. I would definitely recommend The Wilson!",1
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good - especially the fried rice. The service could be a bit more accommodating, but other than that, it was a decent stop for lunch. The only downside was that they charge you 4% if you pay with a card, which is a bit annoying in today's economy.",1
"Khalo is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The cocktails are delicious and the food is really good. The atmosphere is really cool and clubby, and it's always packed. I definitely recommend this place!",1
"I had the pleasure of visiting this hidden gem in Times Square after it was recommended to me by a chef in Mexico City. And I must say, he was absolutely right- this place rocks! I've been a few times now and tried most things on the menu. My personal favorite is the adobada mula, which is like an open-faced quesadilla. They also offer horchata, which is one of the most delicious beverages in the world, but it's not easy to find in Manhattan. The only downside is the line/standing/counter situation, but it's a small price to pay for the authenticity of the experience. All in all, I highly recommend this place for a quick meal.",1
"Chose Sonnyboy for Sunday brunch and put my party of two on their Waitlist via Yelp before walking over. The wait itself was 40 minutes, and right as we were next on the waitlist, my name was removed from their waitlist by the host for not checking in in-person. (Don't forget to do that if you use the online waitlist!) We eventually got seated and had the smashed avocado and Hotcake.Smashed avocado with poached egg - large portion, perfectly poached egg, good textures and flavor from crispy pistachios and feta cheese Hotcake - excellent blueberry sauce on topOverall, a decent brunch spot. I would return to try a few more of their menu.",0
"Xi'an Famous Foods is a restaurant that I could go on and on about. Literally everything on the menu is amazing, and you can't go wrong with anything you order. The N2 (spicy and tingly beef noodles), extra spicy, and the tofu soup are my personal favorites, but I love how spacious the location is, especially with the amount of lunchtime midtown foot traffic there is. However, I find that the service here is slower than other locations, and that's definitely a downside. All in all, Xi'an Famous Foods is a restaurant that I highly recommend, and I'll continue to come back!",1
Ordered take out from here via chownow.com. The restaurant offered a quarantine special - $28 for 20 wings and 4 beers so thought I'd give a try. I was able to choose 2 flavours for the 20 wings so I chose honey mustard and the hot buffalo wings. I went to pick it up myself and only had to wait for a few minutes for it to be ready. I asked if I could choose the beers but it was already packaged. The wings were freshly made and I enjoyed it. The hot wings weren't as hot as I thought it was going to be but I enjoyed it. The honey mustard wings were also nice and saucy. The 4 beers they packed weren't bad - ok selection overall. Can't complain for the price we paid. Will definitely order from here again!! Also - the restaurant separated sanitized pens vs  used pens (see picture). I thought that was a nice touch!,0
"I enjoyed the flavor of the beef wrap and the scallion pancake. The scallion pancake had a good consistency, but the jasmine green tea had a somewhat soggy consistency. My friend did not like his chicken bowl because it didn't have many veggies. The chicken bowl felt like it lacked a balanced flavor. The rice bowl also came with a plastic lid, which I thought was wasteful. Overall, I thought the food was good but could use some improvement in terms of flavor and presentation.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was fresh and taste great. The staff was super friendly and I enjoyed talking to them. The only downside was that the salmon was a little dry for my taste. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a nice, relaxing lunch.",1
"The food here is good, but it's overpriced for what it is.  Been a couple times, and this example from today is typical:Got three fish tacos, which were tasty but quite small tacos, for $19 bucks...  and that's the lunch special price.  I'd probably not recommend.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good! The delivery was super fast and the food arrived warm/hot. The only downside is the price - it's a bit expensive for diner food. But overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal. My favorites were the bone-in NY strip and the lasagna al forno. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and the tomato sauce used in the lasagna was really delicious. The calamari was also great - it was crispy without being greasy, and the seasoning was perfect. The only downside was that the corkage fee was a bit high, but overall this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.",1
Ordered delivery from here this week for restaurant week since it's only to go this year! I got the patty melt with curly fries. It was SO much food for such a great price! The patty melt was the exact comfort food I needed in this cold weather! The curly fries were delicious as well! My food came fairly quickly and arrived warm and delicious!,0
Enjoyed my cheese enchiladas here and had a marg pitcher which was pretty standard. Ordering on the app was a little wonky but overall fine experience,0
"Came in for drinks and apps with a girl friend, and loved the enthusiasm of the staff! Immediately was greeted by multiple waitresses, and our server was so knowledgeable about the wine list.We ordered the patatas Bravas and a few glasses of their white wines. Recommend asking your server for their favorites :)",0
"I have been going to Ippudo for years and was so excited to find their takeout restaurant Kuro-Obi at a couple Urbanspace locations.  With so many ramen options in Manhattan, I tend to be particular about where I go.  Ippudo is one of the top ramen restaurants on my list and I have been very happy with the food at the Kuro-Obi locations. My most recent meal was when I ordered ramen for dinner via Seamless when I worked late and ate at my desk. ***I accidentally posted this review before I was done***I ordered the ""Kuro-Obi"" Layered Chicken Broth Ramen. The order arrived quickly and was still hot.  Other than how great it tasted and how quick it arrived, what was impressive about the order:- not only are the noodles separated from the soup so as not to get soggy, etc., but - all the other components arrive in separate containers, including the garlic oil, umami paste, pork chasu and vegetable toppings- in the case that the order is not still hot, a little card with instructions comes with the order on how to best reheat it and then combine it. Such a great idea to leave the broth separate for reheating before adding the oils, toppings etc to it! Impressive!",0
"Sole di Capri is a great restaurant for those looking for a delicious Italian meal. The pasta dishes are particularly delicious, and the prices are reasonable. The tiramisu is also a great dessert option.",1
"I'd like to preface this review by stating that I actually like Bareburger. I've been to several locations around NYC and enjoyed my food at each of these locations. So when friends suggested we stop by this Bareburger after a day of exploring SoHo, I didn't even question it. What I should have done was taken 10 seconds to look at the reviews. The three stars alone would have deterred me. But I digress...This is not a normal location. This is an order and sit. Meaning there is no server. To put it plainly, Our food was simply disappointing and disgusting. My burger was small, overlooked and covered in way too much sauce. The onion rings were so burnt they were hard. The sweet potato fries were bland and soft. Not to mention the amount of sweet potato fries and rings we got for the $7 paid was downright insulting.In regard to atmosphere, I can't comment on the overall vibe given we visited during the CV outbreak when everyone was social distancing. However I can confirm one should not sit in the front left window unless they want a seat heater. The furnace is beneath the bench and it is VERY warm. Also, a lovely little COCKROACH lives under that bench and paid us a visit during our meal. That experience alone solidified this single star review.Should you decide to eat here after this review, I wish you the very best.",0
I had a great time at this restaurant again! The pizza is definitely the best in New York City - definitely worth trying. The tie-dye pizza with the pesto drizzle is a must-have! Thanks for a great experience.,1
"We had an amazing time at this restaurant! The service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was perfect. Our server, Bessi, was so nice and accommodating. The food was delicious, and we were able to try a lot of different things. We especially enjoyed the mussels and escargot appetizers, and the steaks and duck confit were also very good. We can't wait to come back and try more things!",1
"Food was pretty decent. They're a little bit light on the sauce for the curry fish ball and the peanut butter and sweet sauce but you can ask them to drench it. I've ordered by phone a few times and picked up 30 minutes later and never had an issue.Things are slightly on the pricier side. It's $4 or so for their large, which is a small everywhere else. Other than that, food isn't bad and worth a try if you can make it in time.",0
"Overall, I was disappointed but although disappointing, there are still some positives.  First, the staff is very friendly.  I was welcomed into the shop warmly and the staff was very nice. The pickup area is small but has a nice place to sit while you wait for your food and the food comes out quickly.  I like the mural.However, the positives just don't outweigh some major negative. The food is just way too expensive for takeout Chinese food.  I got an order of Mongolian beef with white rice, for $20.00 and that was only a single serving.  The food is way better than Panda Express, but just like the frozen P.F. Chang's you can get at the supermarket.And for $20 the portion are relatively small, so no next-day leftover if you order here. In comparison to any local Chinese carry out there food is better and cheaper and they win hands down if I had to decide between  P.F. Chang's and them.",1
"Really great friendly service.  Coffee and water cups never empty, food arrived fairly quickly, and server really worked.  Good, friendly service really makes a difference.The food...we both agreed the coffee was not very good.  I really enjoyed the Athenian Omelette with salsa, the potatoes were crispy and a joy to eat.  Wife was far less enthusiastic about the french toast.Would we go back?  I think we both agree we Butchers Daughter or 12 Chairs are better choices.  Given the difference in opinions on the food, I suspect we would look for other options.",0
"I visited The Boil a few weeks ago and I absolutely loved it! The seafood was fresh and really delicious. The seasoning was really good and not too salty. The price is very similar to other seafood boil restaurants, but the quality of the seafood at The Boil is much better. The service was amazing and very attentive. My water cup was never half empty and my trash bucket was never filled to the top. I always had extra napkins. There's always a waitress/ waiter standing on the side just in case you need something. And at the end of your meal they hand you a wet wipe, which they unwrap for you so you don't struggle. They even put on and tie the bib for you. You just sit there and relax. The atmosphere of the place was really clean and had nice decors that made me feel like I was at a restaurant right next to a beach. The music there had me vibing and singing along. I definitely recommend The Boil if you're looking for a great seafood boil restaurant.",1
Pretty good noodles! Line goes by quickly. I dont think they're super spicy so don't be afraid when reading the warning label on menu. My favorite was the spicy Cucumbers! So good.,0
Great empanadas in Hell's Kitchen!  Prices are good and they are hot and ready to roll.  Don't forget the green sauce - it's a must to top all your food for that extra spicy kick!!!  I had the Cuban sandwich once and it was also delicious but I honestly come here for the empanadas as they are quick and easy to grab!!,0
"The grilled cheese was ok, though a bit too greasy. 

The employees were very pleasant and friendly. 

Our food was prepared promptly and accurately. 

The soda station was clean and well stocked. 

This place is great for a pre-show lunch or dinner, as it is quick and convenient. 

However, it does not provide a significant variety of extras to put in to the sandwich. 

Also, the web site shows more items which were not available in store.I would come back.",1
"The atmosphere at this restaurant is really cute and spacious. The Christmas decorations are really pretty and added a touch of cheerfulness to the place. The staff was super friendly and checking in a lot which was really appreciated. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect. The only downside was that the tiramisu wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu.",1
"I went to the restaurant 5 years ago. It was really good！！！Yummy！！Unfortunately, stuffs were not kind that time......",0
"Food was delicious but it was not filling at all. It was pretty pricey for what it's worth, but I guess that's NYC for ya. We ordered a bunch of basic items from the menu like the pad kemao, laksa, pad thai, etc. Everyone enjoyed their meal, but they were still fairly hungry after. That's why I'm docking a star off!",0
"The food at this restaurant was fantastic! The salad was fresh and had a great flavor, the octapodi ksidato was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor, the moussaka was also very good, and the garides saganaki was delicious. The only downside was that the psita tis oras poikilia was a little dry and not as flavorful as the other dishes. But overall, I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant.",1
"Stopped by Marseille for dinner last September with a friend and her mother before we caught Oklahoma! down the street! I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered a few apps. We had complementary bread and herb butter - the bread was a bit too hard to chew for my taste, but the flavor was excellent!Service was rather slow; I understand being busy for dinner, but we did communicate that we had to be at a show within an hour. Our server was pretty gracious about us paying for our food early, but I did wish that things had been sped up just a tad. I ordered the tuna tartare and the escargot, both of which were quite delicious! I also did wish that the tuna tartare came with a few more of the chips, just because the ratio was so off. But the escargot were excellent and wonderfully flavored.The next time I'm in the area I'd love to come back and sample some of their entrees! The others in my party ordered the seafood burger and the regular burger - I tried a bit of the seafood burger and it was quite delicious!",0
"This is my grandma's favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown. I came with my grandma and mom the other day; they each got a pork chop noodle soup ($9.25), I got a grilled chicken over cold vermicelli ($9.25), and we shared a small Vietnamese spring rolls ($6.25). Meat portions are very plentiful and everything is flavorful. The grilling is not very consistent; sometimes the meat needs to be grilled more. They also give a lot of noodles. The spring rolls were hot and crunchy. Service is very normal here, which is honestly a win for Chinatown establishments. Would come back!",0
"Don Antonio is a hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. The atmosphere is lively and the food is delicious - I recommend ordering pizza and wine. The menu is interesting and there are a lot of unique items on it, so it's definitely worth trying some of them out. The service is excellent and the staff are very friendly. It's always a good time when I go here, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",1
"I wanted to really like this place and looked forward to trying Genesis House's set menu. However, I left quite disappointed. The interior and venue was stunning (though night time lighting was minimal), the wait staff were great, and the food was just okay -- nothing spectacular. However, the $150 price point didn't justify the just okay food. The first dish (suranchae) was probably the only course that was actually good, while to dessert was interesting. The rest were uninspiring for the price point. The tuna was overpowered by the cilantro, the grilled sirloin was seemingly a better presented Korean bbq dish, the tofu rice wasn't anything special.",0
"Top Thai is one of the best Thai places in nyc. Portions are large and prices are so reasonable. The drinks are amazing, the food is delicious, service is on point, I would take ANYONE here. We ordered three appetizers: the fried chicken dumplings, fried tofu and calamari. The chicken pad Thai is cooked perfectly and since I like it a bit spicier we were given a tray of chili sauces to add additional spice to our food. I also had a lychee mojito which was not too sweet and pretty big for the price. The Thai mule is the best drink!!! They have a happy hour too so take advantage of that!!! I'm a huge fan of Top Thai",0
"Get here early and put your name down. I think all the hype is worth it but the lack of reservations and wait can be a pain. Via Carota is cozy and delicious and inviting. We had the pancetta pasta, fried olives, and pork braised in milk and it was all delicious. We sat at the bar and thought service was fantastic. Dessert was great, especially the cake. My only complaint is that the tiramisu had too much mascarpone. I'd definitely come back again.",0
Came to Tacuba with a large group and had a great time. They have a great cocktail list or you can order pitchers for the table. We shared the guacamole and nachos -- apps were good but nothing too spectacular. For entrees we tried a variety of dishes. I personally got the carne asada plate and enjoyed it. Overall it was pretty good food and I would recommend for a large group.,0
"I tried out this restaurant and I enjoyed it! The food was yummy and not overpriced, and the ambience was cute for a date. The only downside is that it's not somewhere I absolutely have to go back to, but it's a nice place. I especially enjoyed the ramen, salmon roll and skewer. All of them were good but like I said, nothing blew my mind. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a place to eat that's not too expensive and is cute and cozy.",1
"Reliable fresh Mexican with great variety and solid drinks and a nice later-in-the-evening happy hour.  The platter -- choose your protein -- is a very satisfying option, but also consider the burrito bowl if you are trending low-carb.",0
"I was craving for some good Thai in the neighborhood & ordered from here after reading the reviews.The vegetable dish was too salty & soggy with a hint of MSG & the fried rice was too oily & bland. What a huge disappointment. I ate just one third of the food & dumped the rest. I won't order anything from here again for sure,",0
"The food was OK, but the hainese chicken was pretty pricey. The taste of the chicken was average, but I didn't feel like it was particularly better than other places. The chicken laksa was also average. I didn't feel like it tasted better compared to other places. The Kaya toast was good. The white coffee was also good.",1
I wish we have good izakaya in the US and Izakaya MEW absolutely delivers! This place is the definition of good cooking. They cooked and seasoned each dishes really well. I actually really like the creamy kimchi udon as the acidity of kimchi cut through the creaminess really well. Also the beef tongue was sliced thinly and grilled to perfection. The grilled tongue will get 5 stars from me. The crab croquette takoyaki were good but the fatty tuna sushi were just ok.Overall this is a very solid izakaya where people come and chill and have some drink with good food. The ambient and the staffs were very friendly. 4 stars - Will definitely come back again!,0
"My friend and I visited NYC for Memorial Day weekend. We wanted some soul food Saturday afternoon, so we did a quick Google search and came across Amy Ruth's. The reviews looked good, so we decided to give it a try.We walked up and there was a short line, so we put our name on the waitlist. We were called and seated in no time. As soon as we sat down, a server came and greeted us. We ordered mimosas and waters to drink and then ordered our meals. After putting in our order, the server came back with a bread basket which was super good! The drinks were okay, but nothing to rave about.For my meal, I ordered The State Senator Brian Benjamin, which are the fresh salmon croquettes. These were some of the best salmon croquettes I've EVER had! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside...so great! I ordered macaroni and cheese and collard greens as my sides, and these were less than desirable. The macaroni and cheese had a weird, almost sweet taste and the greens tasted a little sweet too. They looked great, but the taste didn't match how good they looked. I ate a few bites of each, but completely finished the croquettes.This was a cute place, but I don't see the hype...maybe because I'm from the South and have tasted some of the most amazing soul food. But off the strength of the salmon croquettes alone, I'll give this an okay rating.",0
"I stopped by Covid Wise for happy hour and dinner and was really happy with the experience. The tables are a bit close together, but I didn't encounter anyone else there so it was fine. They have $3 beers and $6 wines EVERYDAY from 4 - 7! The service was decent, nothing over the top and nothing bad. My favorite part of the meal was the massaman curry. It was spicy enough for me but also had a lot of chicken in it, which was great. The curry puffs were also great. They come with four and they were delicious and piping hot. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. It was a quiet area so no one was interrupting us, but there are enough people going by that you have something to people watch. The value of the food was a good deal and I can't wait to come back.",1
"This is my ""go-to"" place for breakfast in SoHo. Has been for more than 20 years. It's not super fancy - it is super cozy and they are consistent with the good eats and pleasant service. You can't go wrong here and most of the tourist crowd that has invaded SoHo over the past 20 years won't stumble in here, so you can enjoy a nice breakfast with a friend or even alone!",0
"I visited this bar on a Sunday morning and it was quite busy! It's a great spot for a casual drink with friends, and the outdoor seating is perfect for enjoying the weather. The staff was very friendly and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this bar!",1
"The Gem Saloon is a great spot for drinks before dinner during Restaurant Week. The happy hour specials are solid, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. I especially enjoyed the Tito's and soda for $8. Some of the draft beers were also discounted at $5. Overall, I'd definitely recommend The Gem Saloon.",1
"I always enjoy a meal at this restaurant. The drinks are delicious and they have a wide variety of gluten free options. I would definitely recommend making reservations, as they tend to be very busy.",1
"Amazing food, but unfortunately extremely poor service. Came here with one of my friends on here on a Pulsd voucher one evening for dinner. The voucher included a bottle of wine, one appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert. The waiter never checked on us during the meal, nor did he provide basic wait staff service without being asked (ie. Providing pita bread for the table, asking if our food was okay, was everything served, would we like to order anything additionally,etc.). I guess he figured he was going to be paid his 20% tip either way (included in the bill), so he provided minimal effort. The food itself was fresh and very flavorful (typical Greek style). Interior design was cute as well. Unsure if I'd return based on the service alone.",0
"So I had been wanting to go to this place for awhile now. Also saw that it was busy and full of people. The set up for outdoor dining was cozy and they had heaters. The regular Tagliatelle was $20ish which is decent price but the Truffle dish was like $32-35?! I'm not well informed on truffle items but I think the price was ridiculous. The pasta was good but not worth the price. Menu was small, but not worth going back a second time.",0
"Dim Sum Chelsea is a great place to go for lunch if you're looking for something different. The spicy pork wontons in chili oil are my favorite item on the menu, and the Crystal shrimp dumpling is also a great choice. The chicken dry hotpot is also a great option if you're looking for something a little more spicy. All of the dishes are affordable, and the restaurant is nicely decorated and well-run. I would definitely recommend Dim Sum Chelsea to anyone looking for a great lunch option!",1
"The food here wasn't great, and the prices are a bit high for what you get. The waffle was burnt, the strawberries were old and not fresh, and it's very small. They do give a fair amount of Nutella which is nice, but the service is quick. If it was cheaper it wouldn't be all that bad, but for almost $12, it's not worth it. Nice novelty though for this visiting or if you just want that ""Instagram"" pic.",1
It was going to be a late night and I knew I had to eat. I was very skeptical of going to bread and butter after all the stories I heard from coworkers.  I played it safe and had a chicken Parmesan panini.  It was almost $10 and not even made fresh.,0
"We came to Ella's hungry and ready for a good brunch. We were seated right away and the dining room was well-decorated and cute. The food is unfortunately what we were disappointed by. Two of us ordered the baked eggs--we didn't really know what to expect but it sounded good. I got the smoked salmon and my friend got the spinach and mushroom. Hers came out at a normal temperature with semi-runny eggs in the skillet but she complained that it was bland. No seasoning or flavor. Mine came out literally boiling and by the time it settled down and I could finally eat it, the eggs had a hard center and were overdone. At least mine had more flavor because of the smoked salmon. My other friend got the eggs Benedict and his poached eggs were hard in the center too, which isn't what he wanted.The home fries weren't great either. They had a strange flavor and they were pretty soggy, not crispy at all. The white sangria was good, which is why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. The service was ok, but not the best. Maybe this place is better for dinner, but if they're going to continue having brunch, they should work on their recipes!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The crispy, thin crust pizza was delicious. The tomato sauce had a hint of sweetness which was really unique. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"This place was available on OpenTable with the timeslot that worked and had excellent reviews on both Yelp and OT.Like others have mentioned they were trying to rush us and when I asked about the dessert tasting menu they looked at me like I was putting them out. They had to move us to the bar for that which I was fine with. Just wished they mentioned that in the beginning of the meal so that it didn't turn awkward.Food was beautiful, tasted as well as it looked and we opted for the seasonal tasting menu.One thing to note which all Michelin stared restaurants seem to be doing are having the same game foie gras and black/white truffle in served one way or another.The true winners were the black cod, duck, Omija Korean wild berry drink, and the white chocolate shaped banana. The uniqueness and beauty of Michelin stared restaurants are to be sui generis and unparagoned from others. I feel that is what is happening all over and is sad and the wow factor is no longer there.Not sure I will return because of the high price, but did enjoy the meal from start to finish nevertheless.",0
"This place has a large variety of pizza and very unique pizza combinations. Their cheese slices are $1. Ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. It was reheated in their oven for a little too long, so the crust was too crispy. The flavors were good, but the crust was a bit too tough and cheese didn't taste too fresh. Not bad for pizza, but there's plenty of other better pizza places in NYC.",0
"Little bit torn on my rating for Tacuba... I'm somewhere between a 3 and 4 on this one... four for the atmosphere and 3 for the food.For starters the space is GORGEOUS.  We visited on a beautifully warm day with the front windows wide open letting the sunshine and breeze in.  The rustic woods, the decorative tile work, the industrial style lighting fixtures - the entire place is just sooo soo pretty.The brunch menu is a good one.  There's ricotta-lime pancakes with hibiscus syrup, enchiladas, carnitas w/ habanero-tamarind salsa (say what!?), poblano peppers filled w/ quinoa and mushrooms.  And of course tacos, guac, and margaritas!This gal went the taco route and I was sliiiiightly disappointed with them.  The menu says the tacos come w/ 3 in the order and they are 'appetizer size' and I wish I had paid closer attention to that... these tacos were small!  And the chicken was drenched in a sauce that I can only describe as 'spaghetti o's like'.  The menu says the chicken is marinated in adobo but I'd sure like to know what they poured on the taco to serve it. On the plus though -- the guac was real nice. Chunky and full of tomato, onion and a little spice. Butttt maybe a little smaller than I had hoped for.  We had to ask for extra chips to finish up the salsa too.The frozen margarita were perfectly blended and mango-y (they also have other fruity options...).  One side note - the margaritas are pre-made... so my galfriend who was 5 months preggo at the time couldn't have a virgin margarita... thankfully the bartender was up to making a mocktail for her with fresh grapefruit and agave.Not my favorite mexican spot in the city, but I'd be willing to try it again.  But I won't order the chicken tacos again...",0
Holy Sheep Sh!t Batman! This restaurant is killer!!!Incredible little restaurant in Nolita. I've been on weeknights and went for the airstrip time on a Saturday and the restaurant is always slammed. Reservations are a must. The service is incredible and the kitchen keeps up with the demand. The Cacio e Pepe is so much better than a Caesar. Light anchovie vinegrette. Garlic bread crumbs. Fried capers. Parm. Delicious. The Tagliatelle will make you a believer. The pasta is out of control good. Sticks to your teeth. Incredible flavor. That's just the pasta - not even talking about the bolognese rage. This not standard red checker cloth ragu. This is not even the best ragu my wife makes. This is insane - lick the bowl when you're done - get another order - f'n great!The Petroniana - next level. Incredible veal lightly breaded covered with melted Parm Swiss and a little truffle cream served over spinach. I want to go back my mouth is watering thinking about it. I love this spot.,0
"BCD is a famous Korean chain, and for good reason. The food is always good, and the service is usually pretty good, too. However, the line can be pretty long, and the banchan can be a bit lackluster. Still, the Soon Tofu is always good, and the ambiance is pretty cool late at night in Ktown.",1
"I've had consistently excellent meals at Upland with large groups (6-8 guests). For brunch, there's a wide range of options for the breakfast inclined (think eggs, bacon, pancakes), as well as the lunch food fans (pastas, pizza, bowls). I came on a Saturday at 12:30 with a group of 7 and everyone was extremely pleased with both food and drink. Some highlights were the bucatini and the quiche. Portions were perfect and the chef manages to turn fairly simple American dishes to something magnificent. The ingredients are extremely fresh, which makes the world of difference. I've been to upland for dinner as well and my experience was consistent. The waitstaff is very attentive and the service is well paced. If you're looking for a reliably good meal, come to Upland. As and added bonus, I found the decor and ambiance to be perfect for modern American fare.",0
"The restaurant was clean and spacious, and the servicer were on their game. The pricing was fair to topish. The portions were very fair and the liquored pour was very well. I recommend the brunch drinks. I had the ""tower"" very nice selection and very fresh raw fish and shrimps. The pancakes and the truffle burger was very well done and to our liking. I'll be back.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The music was great, service was tentative and warm, and the food was really memorable. The edamame dumplings are a must! Eel tacos were my second favorite. I didn't love the korean popcorn chicken but it was fine. I wonder what the wait is like on a weekday? Either way, I'm excited to come back.",1
"First time here and this place did not disappoint. Food: We ordered the army stew (feeds 2 usually, $34), bibimbap (~$19), pork belly (~$30), marinated short ribs (~$40), 1 chicken skewer ($10), scallion pancake, and 1 soju ($16) & lemonade which fed a group of 4 (total ~ $150), arguably pricey. This place is more about quality over quantity. The bbq dishes (pork belly, short ribs) were very good! Tender & marinated meat for sure. They provide extra sauces (4/person) for you to dip the meat in. Army stew was large and kept warm by a mini stove at your table; it had lots of meat, sausages, & ramen. Soju is pricey, and my favorite is the green grape flavor. The pancake was amazing & tastes better without the sauce!! A must-order imo. Banchan & a bowl of rice are provided to every person. Service: Very attentive & responsiveCOVID: Outdoor dining with heat lamps, tables are somewhat socially distanced. The tables outside are completely separated from the cars on the road. To the owners: I would recommend more air ventilation to happen since it occasionally feels stuffy. Came here on a Tuesday at 7 pm in a group of 4 and we were seated promptly via Yelp reservations. They take temperatures. First-timers: Make a yelp reservation to avoid waiting in long lines.",0
"I had a decent experience at this restaurant. The food was quick and easy to pickup, and the staff were welcoming and accommodating. My only issue was with the pasta dish I ordered - it was dry and overcooked, and didn't taste very fresh. However, the chicken parmigiana was really good, and the broccoli rabe was cooked to perfection. I would definitely come back here, but I would order something else than the pasta dish.",1
"Lobster place:Was craving for some lobster roll and couldn't think of any spot more fresh than the lobster place in Chelsea Market. Been meaning to try this spot out but whenever I visit Chelsea Market the place is always pack with tourist and locals. Decided to hop in during a weekday and surprisingly the line wasn't long. Before getting in, they check your vaccine card then they will stamp you. Afterward feel free to either dine on the sushi bar, buy fresh seafood or get in line for your lobster. What we order: 1) 2 lobster roll picnic box: $53.90 with tax came out to $58.69: this included a lobster roll, your choice of soup and a chip. We got the England clam chowder and the lobster bisque. The lobster Roll was very fresh. The soups were tasty. After you pay, you will go to the other side for pick up. Our order came our quick. I would say this meal was good for a snack not as filling but everything was fresh.",0
"I came to this restaurant with a party of three and I have to say that the service was good, but it was slow. We all got the hangry set and the total came out to be around $50/pp with tip and tax. My favorite was the scallop hand roll but everything else fell short. The flavors were pretty bland for the most part and repetitive. The crab and lobster were pretty much drowned in a citrus-y mayo sauce and you could barely taste the crab/lobster itself. The raw hand rolls were good but nothing special that I would go out of my way for. They also had a free crispy rice offer if you wrote a review on google or yelp and showed it to them. I thought that was a bit sketchy as it kind of pressures someone into writing a review before they even try the food. The fact that you had to show them the review as well would definitely make a person put a good review to avoid any awkwardness. I also didn't like that their ""free crispy rice"" offer was not per person, rather, it was per party. We came as a party of three and it didn't make sense that only 2/3 of us would get to try it so we",1
"Beyond Sushi is a restaurant that I would highly recommend if you're looking for delicious vegan sushi. Their rolls are creative and full of flavor, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The only downside is that their sushi doesn't taste quite as fishy as traditional sushi might, but that's really not a big deal. Overall, I had a fantastic time and I can't wait to go back!",1
"I'm heading to Mexico City next year for vacation and my first priority in trip planning is always researching restaurants. Enrique Olvera's Pujol consistently appears on the greatest hits lists, so I decided to try out his acclaimed Cosme in Flatiron this past Saturday night.The restaurant is sleek and gorgeous, with overflowing plants and cacti being a strong decorative statement. Dark, moody, contemporary, and meticulously outfitted with chic tchotchkes, I delighted in my environs. The service was another strong point, with our waitress eagerly describing many of the dishes, all hands helping clear the table, and expedient mezcal margarita refills. Additionally, all of the plating was beautiful, with tiny edible flowers, and carefully placed adornments.Unfortunately, the food did not measure up to the setting and service. My main complaint was the soft and muted flavors in each dish. The guacamole lacked sourness and acidity, the salsa lacked spiciness, the razor clam tostada, while beautifully plated, was overly simplified. The duck carnitas was delicious, but the duck was prepared in a very straightforward way, with minimal spices. I appreciated the flavor of the perfectly cooked duck itself, but I felt that I could replicate this in my own kitchen at home.My other complaint is the value. There are no prices on the website, but you can expect to pay around $30 per appetizer. While this may seem a little high for a seafood app, it becomes glaringly high for many of the vegetarian appetizers. Even for a prime locale like Flatiron, this pricing is fairly exorbitant compared to the portion size and pricing at other Manhattan restaurants. I hope that Pujol lives up to my expectations when I visit Mexico City next year, but based on Cosme, I may have to temper them quite a bit.",0
"I'm so surprised that this place has so many reviews when the one on the West side is SO MUCH BETTER. The Hells Kitchen location has a wider selection of alcoholic drinks, larger menu, and cheaper happy hour prices. If you look at the menu photo, Rice Dishes are underneath Appetizers, this mistakenly led me to believe that it was a sub-category and that those dishes would be subject to happy hour pricing. I was wrong. The chicken avo don was good and a large portion, however I felt like I was mis-led. At the other location, they serve small bowls of Salmon Avo don for $4 at happy hour. I would honestly recommend those who love this establishment to go check out the West side location. It's so much better in my opinion.",0
"Love this restaurant, it has many seats and fast service. Not very fancy but they feed you well with large portions. The menu is huge and they also have vegetarian options. I recommend the #1 which is the large pho, warm and delicious. As an appetizer the spring rolls are crispy and fried fresh, you cant go wrong.",0
"Old Xi'an is a restaurant that is trying to imitate Xi'An Famous Foods, but their food is not as good. The food here is good for lazy people like me, as it is far enough away from Xi'An Famous Foods that I won't have to walk there.",1
"What a great way to inaugurate indoor dining! The service and food were superb. The restaurant is very spacious and felt great. Outdoor dining was still pretty busy and dining indoors felt calmer without the traffic noise from 42nd street. The menu isn't back to its former glorious self as there is no tasting menu available. They are currently offering a la carte and prix fixe options (3 or 4 courses). The wine list also isn't completely ready, but, while speaking to the knowledgeable and pleasant sommelier, Sam, his focus for the list is value. There is a little bit of everything and most bottles are around $70-150 with a couple of standouts at $500. If a guest really wants something specific and they have it, he mentioned they can usually fulfill the request.All-in-all a very pleasant experience.",0
"Been here twice. Place is pretty big. There is also downstairs seating but wait time for hot pot here is still quite long. Food selection here is similar and comparable to most AYCE hot pot spots. The food is fresh. What I love most about this place is there is dessert included, which you can get near the sauce bar.",0
"Not good for big groups. It's a cute small place and may be a fine for 2-4 people but we did not have a good experience with a group of 12. They require a deposit for group reservations and are strict about seating when the whole/most of party arrives. They also book multiple big parties in the group spaces (downstairs where there is no window), so you will get kicked out. The happy hour only has Sangria and Mojito ($5 each).Food is decent and has good presentation. I would order the grilled octopus salad again but the empanadas were just ok. The tomales were generously portioned and rest of the entrees were pretty but nothing special. We did not receive good service likely because we had a big group and they charge automatic 18% tip. But at least they were organized in the ordering. They took up to 4 credit cards.",0
"Since reopening, the customer service and quality of food has continued to decline. Sadly, I think this location's manager is the one who almost always helps me as I visit this location every other week. After today, I will not return. My coworkers and I agree, the employees do not seem to want to be at work and literally talk and laugh out loud about people in line. My salad today only had 2 chicken strips (I commented to him nicely before when they used 5) and he seemed to forget this salad included avocado. It was missing when I returned to my office. I love Just Salad and will return to other locations.",0
"/)   /)(    )/ づ  づ ~  So idk what the hype is about nyc pizzas but I guess Americans never had a original napoleon pizza because that's the real deal. The pizza at joes was a bit sweet and not really sth that knocked me out. Again original pizza is really what will have you fall in love with pizzas. The dough was thin and nice I liked that, it was crispy. But other than that nothing really excited me. Not worth trying nyc pizza especially if you're from Europe :/ so sorry. I don't think it's joes pizza but just pizza here in general which was not up to my taste or what I'm used to.",0
"I recently visited Joe G Pizza and Restaurant in NYC and was absolutely blown away by the food! The Italian dishes were delicious and the service was great. The only downside to the restaurant is that it's a bit small and cramped, but overall it's a great place to eat. I would definitely recommend Joe G Pizza and Restaurant to anyone visiting New York.",1
"I was really disappointed with Amelie. Our server was good, but the food was below average. The worst part was that the bartenders weren't really helping us. We ended up leaving because the service was terrible. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"This restaurant is adorable and the outdoor seating was perfect for a summer day. The dividers were a nice touch and made us feel very safe. The roti was delicious and came with a curry sauce that was fantastic. The pad kea mao was also delicious as usual. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a casual meal.",1
"amazing experience! will def be back to try more of cheli's delicious dishes.food: i got the longjiang shrimp, stewed pork, smoked fish, snow pea leaves, and jelly milk tea rice wine. the snow pea leaves were phenomenal!!! you can really taste all of the ingredients' freshness with every bite. the longjiang shrimp was also my second favorite. the space: very traditionally decorated, the chairs are slightly uncomfortable but very cute nonetheless! next time i look forward to trying the dessert congee.",0
"Becco is an Italian restaurant that offers fixed pasta dishes for $29. I wasn't particularly impressed with the offerings, with the pesto pasta with green beans having a weird after taste and the turkey tortellini being lack luster. The caesar salad was the only star at the table, with a nice anchovy taste. The chicken parm was tasty, but it was unevenly crispy with the edges burnt. The tables are close together, but the service is either fast if you tell them you are going to a show or slow if you tell them you aren't. Prices are comparable for the area, but food wise nothing stood out.",1
"Love this place! Best to go for lunch so you have some elbow room and can hear your group chatting. In the evening its packed inside and outside seating. Outside closes during bad weather it's not covered.Our group had the lunch happy hour goodness and margaritas are delicious peach - nice and light, mango - bit stronger than the peach, watermelon - like a concentrated jolly rancher... hahaha nachos are plenty for a table to share, not enough cheese and the guacamole is out of this world! Chicken wings are good but a little dry and no flavor if you ask for sauce on the side... they do offer ranch or blue cheese on the side that can get you by.The waitresses rock at this place though. Very attentive to our group and kept everything full and functioning on our table the entire time. It was fabulous! Definitely a spot to pop I to if you're in the area.",0
"For impeccable- but a rustic take on Mediterranean taste (in my opinion), Tessa on the UWS, brings a nice menu and punchy flavors together for a meal I won't be forgetting any time soon. Hubs was all over Tessa the first time a few years ago and named it as one of his favorite restaurants in the area. And since we were in the area...you know what happened next. Even for our 5:30 sit-down, outside was pretty empty. While not exactly 6' (more like 5'?), Tessa tried their hardest to re-create their sidewalk for a safe dining experience. Plus servers all had plastic gloves and masks. Before diving into the food, we kicked things off with some sparkling Rosé. Hubs enjoyed his Meatball app. But we also particularly loved the small- yet sturdy tortilla chips in our Guacamole appetizer. Nothing I hate most than thin tortilla chips cracking all over me- and these held up perfectly. Hubs went for the 'brick 1/2 chicken' and I loved my Baby Kale salad appetizer that I asked to have as my entree with grilled shrimp- which Tessa portioned nicely! Plus we had to have the mandatory Brussel Sprouts minus the bacon. We don't mind returning. The ambience is casual with our girl Michaela(?) and my guy in a purple bandanna handkerchief mask being spot on the entire time.",0
"This French-inspired Korean bakery practically appeared overnight  at this new location with the distinctive blue coloring and theme.The layout is the newer Café version where the counter person may prepare or heat up the item you want vs. the older model where you select cold items from the shelves and place them on your tray. You still find some of the popular Paris Baguette favorites but much less of them.  This store is bigger than most of the Paris Baguette you find in midtown and the very spaciousness of the layout lets you mingle around the displays and service areas. The breads, pastries, cakes here are like most Asian bakeries, they tend to be softer and sweeter than your typical American or European bakery. You will find the desserts are great and not as sweet and are more on the lite side when compared to Madison Kayser. and then you have Soups, sandwiches, and beverages to pick from, breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night snack.I am not sure what will happen to the other Paris Baguette on 7th Avenue a block away. If it remains I will have to decide which one to go to when I am in the neighborhood depending what I am in the mood for.",0
"We'll wasn't really impressed by the food , staff and the whole experience. A few people told me about the place and it being a must try . We ordered the the lobster bisque was ok very brown in color and not so tasty. For our main dish we ordered the porterhouse for three . It's was a large steak more like for four people. Sides were mash potatoes and cream spinach we avg not to write home about . The place is super small and not very planned out in any spacing to walk with out bumping into different tables. We opt to sit out side also a big mistake. Freezing cold and people were smoking weed left and right . In the end a 400 waste of dinner and drinks .",0
I really wanted to like this place but the food really fell short for me. We got the chicken karaage appetizer which was hot and fresh but bland beyond belief. I'm not even sure if it was salted so the exterior just tasted like fried flour. I got the sauce katsu don and my boyfriend got the unatama don. My fried pork looked good but it was far from crispy and was just soaked in oil. The sauce on top of the katsu was the only redeeming factor. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy is meal but I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon.,0
"I had a great time at Artichoke Pizza! The staff was really sweet and the atmosphere was really cozy. The pizza took a little bit longer than I expected, but that's okay because it was worth it. My friend and I both really enjoyed our pizza slices. The price is a bit higher than other pizza places, but it's definitely worth it for the size of the slices. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and delicious NYC experience!",1
Came here again had an amazing waitress named Keisha. The hostess was the meanest person I've ever met in my life. We were given a plate of guac from a couple leaving and he freaked out screaming at us and charged us for it. We were loudly  screamed out and disrespected in our faces by the manager named john. He disrespected us and screamed loudly at us. Never will come back. John should be fired. ((Food is amazing though)),0
"The food is good, but it's not that authentic. The chicken tikka masala could've been Italian practically. The dal just tasted like healthy lentils. No flavor really.",1
"The uni truffle and the spicy pork bone broth ramen were both great choices! The uni truffle is a dry ramen, and packs a full truffle flavor. While it has a cream sauce, it's not overly rich and enjoyed this dish.The spicy pork bone ramen was good too, and the spices added to the deep meat flavor, rather than just making the broth spicy. I would get this ramen specifically for the spices, although it's not really spicy for anyone who's looking for high spice levels. The noodles were a bit thinner and more cooked than I ideally like though.",1
"Boy this place is overhyped, I've never wanted to try it because I knew this place was a tourist trap but the random resy availability and boredom pushed me towards trying something new.I mean this place has it all, the party girls from ibiza with very little clothes on, the flamboyant italian gay man drunk over memosas, skinny russian models looking angry at their food and their rich boyfriends snapping fingers at servers to get their attention. It was absolutely fun to people watch at balthazar! It's missing a few elements but its just a few tables with kids away from being the times square of soho. Service is great, very diner like. I love and appreciate the robotic charm and automatic thank you's. God knows you need to be able to be emotionless to serve in a place like this.Food was fine, also diner like, there's no chef signature dish you're coming for. It's good overpriced food, the eggs were poached perfectly. Had the avocado toast, salsa was a nice addition.I'm puzzled as to why people come here, maybe its the people watching, maybe its because its in soho. Who knows?",0
"The service was great, the atmosphere comfortable, and the ribs cooked to perfection. However, the brisket pieces are large and quite fatty, and the sauces on the ribs, on the table, and in the small plastic containers had a mild, nondescript flavor. The spice was mild and distinctly bbq, but nothing to ""wow"" about. The coleslaw was also mild and lacked a vinegar taste. The sweet potatoes were soft and slightly sweet, with just the right amount of brown sugar on top. The chicken sandwich was on a lovely bun and offered the perfect chicken to bread ratio - with mild sauce and pickles. The meal was filling and the staff lovely, but the flavors were not such that I'd rush back for a second meal. I'm more inclined to continue to search for good BBQ in the area.",1
"5 stars for the mood/atmosphere/vibes/ambiance. 3 stars for the food and drink. Nothing was really mind blowing to me especially for the price. My friends and I ordered a sausage pizza as a main to share, and fries, Brussels sprouts, and burrata for the side. The Brussels sprouts were without a doubt the best thing we had. Burrata itself was good, although we weren't a fan of the large cut tomatoes they served on top of it. The pizza was SO disappointing. We called our waiter and thought they gave us the wrong one because it was covered in arugula. He told us it was correct and after removing a bed of leaves, we saw small slithers of sausage. I would possibly return here for drinks since again, I thought the restaurant itself was beautiful. But would not recommend for food.",0
"Hidden on the upper floor of a building this restaurant serves up some pretty tasty food. The cold noodles were really refreshing because the broth was perfectly cold and not sour. I also really liked the crunch and flavor of the pickled cucumbers and radishes in this dish. The Galbi, on the other hand, was well seasoned. The seafood pancake was the star of the meal. The pancake was crispy and delicious when paired with the sauce. The seafood inside wasn't overcooked and the pancake was filling. Overall, the food was good. I recommend you get the pancake if you go there.",1
"Prince Street Pizza is definitely worth the hype! I was really impressed with the quality of the slices and how fresh they were. The line can get long, but it moves pretty quickly, so I wouldn't worry about that. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting New York.",1
"Two Boots is a great quick grub spot on a Friday evening. The vibe of the place is pretty cool and has a throwback Thursday feel. The food was good - I ordered the Vegan Slice (just for kicks) along with a Buffalo chicken slice, garlic bread and spinach cheese and jalapeño Bomboni(??). The order arrived and we found a Margarita slice instead of the chicken one. (Oh well) 

The Vegan slice was really good - it could be easily fooled if you told me it was regular cheese. The base by themselves were okay. It was a decent pizza slice. The Margarita topping was good too.

I was not impressed by the garlic bread but my oh my that stuffed pasty thing was so good(sorry I don't remember what's it called). Would definitely stop by to get that buttery flaky goodness. Two boots has stuck around for quite some time and hope to see them continue stay in business.",1
"Lamias is a trendy new restaurant with beautiful interiors that is perfect for hosting an event. The interiors are truly whimsical and really tap into the underwater vibe, since seafood is their specialty. My favorite dish was the piri piri scallops, followed by the chilli garlic prawns. The seafood quality was good and the dishes were flavorful. The truffle flatbread was good, but I would suggest trying the other dishes here. The clam linguini was a good main dish with good flavors. Overall, I had a great experience at Lamias and would definitely recommend it to others!",1
"I absolutely love this Japanese udon place in Manhattan! I always get the hot udons (my favorites being Niku and Ebiten) but this time I tried the cold udon (oroshi $14) and it was just as delicious. It has grated daikon and bonito flakes and although the portions look small, it was just enough to make me full and content. I love how chewy the noodles are and the flavors also come together nicely without any artificial flavors. I come here pretty often and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for udon in the city!",1
The food was par. Great location lovely staff. Clean and bright. Had the skirt steak. The price did not reflect the food. It was mediocre. Not bad at all but not for what we paid. The Mahi was just okay. And the crab cake was way over cooked. But the lump crab shrimp cocktail rocked. I'll be back for drinks not food.,0
"Had brunch with Eastwood's version of huevos rancheros and a mimosa. I usually come for the fish sandwich and an ale. The menu is limited, but everything is prepared with care and delicious.Great selection of craft beers and wine. Amazing vinyl collection.I'm thankful to have Eastwood in the neighborhood.",0
"Birria is a must-go restaurant for anyone looking for a delicious street food experience without having to travel to Brooklyn or Queens. The food is rich and flavorful, with prices that are reasonable given the quality of the dishes. The service is prompt and the line is usually short. The only downside is that the food can get oily and soggy fairly quickly, making it difficult to carry it further than a few blocks or 10 minutes on foot. However, the outdoor seating area next to the Shake Shack is a great way to finish your meal!",1
"Da Toscano is an Italian restaurant that opened during 2020, that I'd long wanted to go to, but only just made it here in May of this year. I made a reservation for one or two weeks prior to coming here. The reservations were easy to make on Resy, and had lots of open times. At the time of dining, they had both outdoor and indoor dining available. When we arrived, there were a couple of other diners already sitting and eating. We were seated immediately and brought water right away. We ordered two starters, the polpette and the PB&J bombolone. The polpette were very good, but I feel like this is a common appetizer and that it's hard to go wrong with meatballs. The PB&J bombolone on the other hand was my favorite dish here, and a very unique offering. It consisted of peanut butter and jelly along with foie gras encased in a doughnut like pastry. The foie gras went perfectly with the peanut butter and jelly. For mains, we had the tortellini and the gnocchi. I thought both were good but nothing to write home about. We also had the asparagus, which was pleasant and simply cooked. The service was pleasant and efficient. Would recommend for a nice Italian meal in the village.",0
"Pretty awesome experienceWe dined at Bazar Tapas for an easy breezy Sunday and could not have been more pleased with our meal and cocktails. Bazar has both indoor and outdoor dining options, but we were sat at a table in the back of the restaurant. It's kind of interesting because the front and back of the restaurant feel like two different restaurants. We ordered an array of delectable bites - actually we may have ordered TOO  much food, but going over our daily calorie intake was well worth it. For our meal we went with the mussels, pan con tomate, patatas bravas (no tapas meal is complete without these), bone marrow, and the paella del mar.  I thought it was a bit strange/different (in a good way) that the patatas bravas was served with cheese. I do not think that I have eaten this tapa with cheese. As I mentioned, I think that we ordered too much food because we had to box up pretty much all of the paella for the road. As of Jul 2021: the restaurant has a 50% off special on Sundays and Mondays for the paella, which is typically $72. While the paella's price tag might be a bit high for some, it is chopped full of seafood. Also, the paella is meant for two people, but it is large enough for 3-4 folks if ordering a couple more tapas. While I did enjoy the paella, it was not the absolute best that I have had in NYC. However, Bazar's paella is definitely in the top five. While the restaurant has a nice selection of cocktails, I stuck with the French 77, which is Bazar's take on the French 75. Since the French 77 had strawberry puree, I was afraid that it was going to be too sweet, but the bartender made the beverage perfectly tart for me. I'm so glad that we added another Spanish restaurant to our dining arsenal. Please do not tell the other Spanish restaurants that we frequently visit that we tried out a new spot. ;)",0
"I had the chicken tikka masala with okra for lunch and it was decent. The sauce was warm and tomatoey and the okra was a bit on the cool side, but still edible nonetheless. The basmati rice was also decent. This place is ok if you work in the area and craving Indian food, but there are a lot of better Indian spots in the city. They also offer kheer and mango lassi, which happen to be some of my favorite desserts here.",1
"Came here for lunch on a rainy Saturday. They had an extensive lunch menu with a good variety of fixed priced options. I had the fried tofu and spicy shrimp with rice. The fried tofu was delicious- crispy but not greasy. The highlight of the meal. The shrimp were served in a yellow curry sauce that was tangy and not too spicy. The shrimp had shells on, which made for a very messy experience. I liked the presentation of the Thai iced-tea in a tiki-type tumbler. The ambiance was nice - small and quiet enough to have a conversation.",0
"Very impressed with this restaurant. They claimed to be ""elevated Thai food"" and I agreed.- Pak mor cashew: 5/5 i don't see this dish on other Thai restaurants' menu. It's very interesting to eat the ""rice roll"" with coconut milk. - Pad see ew: 5/5 my bf insisted to try this typical dish. That's how he judges a great Thai eatery. We could taste the wok flavor, right amount of sweetness. We will come back to try other dishes especially the khao soi and massaman",0
"I loved our visit to this hopping restaurant last night! We sat at the bar and watched the bartenders work their magic. Damn those drinks were strong and so good. I had the chicken quesadillas and they were delicious. The salsa and pico they serve is spicy and yummy. The portion size was perfect. I left full, happy and a bit tipsy.Update. Second visit and dropping some stars. The margaritas are fabulous and the bartenders are friendly but my food this time, not so fab. I ordered the carne asada tacos. Well the first one I tried was nothing but grizzle and fat. I literally spit it out on the side of the plate. Then I decided to see if the other others were better. Nope! Gross! I exchanged it for chicken tacos.. well they were those bland tacos ever. Literally just chunks of unseasoned meat.. I may come back but only for drinks next time.",0
"Cute neighborhoody Israeli spot. Most menu items range from ok to very good. Nothing is truly excellent though, and the place sufferers from some logistical shortcomings: large AC unit is too effective for near tables and ineffective for other tables, some of the seats are uncomfortable, and the outdoor/sidewalk area isn't kept as clean as it should. Service is good when the place isn't busy, but on weekends the staff seems overwhelmed and attention wait time can be annoying",0
"I was hesitant to try this restaurant after reading the reviews, but I'm surprisingly happy with my experience. The food was solid - the broiled chicken was fresh, tender, and flavorful, and the vegetable rice was flavorful and savory. I would skip the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes - both are rather bland - but go for the chicken - it's cheap, fresh, and a good healthy option. A whole chicken is $13 and will easily last 2-3 meals. Delivery was very fast and the food was delivered on time. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal at a good price.",1
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The service was warm and inviting, and the staff was attentive. The only thing that was a bit lackluster was the classics caipirinha. Although it was prepared in a traditional manner, which I erroneously thought it was supposed to contain mint and it's not, it just wasn't as good as the passion caipirinha which allowed for the cachaça to stand out with lovely notes.

I did order appetizers, and they were all delicious. The Bobo de Camarao was finger licking good among that coconut cream sauce it came is had me in love. The Fraldinha saltada was equally delectable and the twist from other versions that come with fries this version came with yuca fries and definitely became a preferred alternative. I love rice and let me tell you I loved this rice and mixed with the corresponding sauces from the dishes we had we were in carb heaven. Worthwhile restaurant to return to.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food at this restaurant. I ordered a chickwich and a side of small fries on a Thursday evening around 7pm in the summer, and the lines were super long and there was one cashier taking orders. Most of their clientele seems to pays in cash so that added to the time of each transaction. The person who took my order (turned out to be a supervisor) didn't ask me if I wanted grilled or fried chicken in my sandwich. 20 minutes later after my friend got her food, I went up to the counter to inquire about the status of my food and they'd said they didn't know if I wanted grilled or fried chicken. I was there the whole time and someone could have asked me. The fries had been sitting there for a while and were cold and soggy by the time the sandwich came out. The supervisor kindly gave me a free dessert and free soft drink for the inconvenience, but the food was not worth the wait or the frustration when you just want fast, casual dining.",1
"Chose this place for our first dining experience in months specially because they have great outdoor dining space. The tables are spaced a good 6 feet apart and the staff wear masks and gloves at all times. The food was great - we got the lamb steak and hanger steak along with some drinks. The pomegranate spritz was perfect for the weather. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was cause the bathroom wasn't very clean. Especially at a time like this, I would've expected better.",0
"This place is fantastic! The beef noodle soup is very, very good - a great bowl of noodles with a rich and deep flavor. The prices are a bit high, but well worth it in my opinion. The service is excellent as well - very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!",1
"We came to Two Wheels on a weekend for lunch. It is located in the UES and from our quick scan on yelp restaurants, it seems to be one of the few Vietnamese places around. It is a fairly small shop (maybe enough seats for 10-15 people) but inside is very chic and modern.We got the Parmesan Truffle Fries, Vermicelli with Pork and Deluxe Pho. I think we've been in NYC for too long and expected smaller on average dish sizes from any restaurant we go order from; that was not the case at Two Wheels. We got a giant helping of fries, vermicelli and pho. Honestly, we easily could have shared a single entrée and fries and would have been more than satisfied for the meal. The parmesan fries can easily be shared with a group of 4 people. I was pleasantly surprised about the quantity we go for the appetizer and the flavors! Usually I'm not the biggest truffle person but Two Wheels' truffle fries are just the right about of truffle flavor without overpowering the rest of the dish. The Vermicelli dish was also very good! I've had better grilled pork at other places but this one was pretty solid. Fresh vegetables! They give you fish sauce on the side and I thought it was a good amount for me personally.Overall pretty great Vietnamese place in UES. Would definitely come back.",0
"Food: 4:5Stopped by for dinner with a friend. We ordered the crab soup dumpling, the tofu with pork, and the dandan noodles. The crab soup dumpling (3/5) was just ok. The skin was thin and the texture was just right but it lacked soup. I expected it to be more mouthwatering but I found it a bit dry. The tofu with pork (4/5) was the perfect combo of sweet and savory. The sauce was amazing! The dandan (4/5) was different from what I'm used to but it was delicious! It was loaded with mala hot sauce and it was a bit more liquidy than expected but it was delicious!Service: 4/5We sat indoors. The staff is doing a great job enforcing social distancing. They even check your temperature before seating you. Very attentive and accommodating.Ambiance: 4/5Dark and modern. Great place to grab grub or even bring a date. Laid back casual dress code yet can dress up too. Very clean and spread out. A step above your typical St. Mark's vibe.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant in New York City! The Korean food was delicious and stood out amongst the other restaurants nearby. I started with a fried small fish and it was very crispy and delicious. I was also surprised to get one as a surprise. For starters, I got the seafood pancake and the tteokbokki. The pancakes were a bit oily and not crispy enough for my taste, but the tteokbokki was okay, lacking texture. For the main, I got the kimchi+beef soondubu that came with the tofu stew and a bowl of rice. The sides that came with my table were good, but not my favorite. The kimchi wasn't as flavorful- lacking some spice and sour. The soup and rice were very filling and warm, perfect for a cold day. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and the food was good, but nothing about it was particularly memorable.",1
"The Maze was a really cool spot. I stopped in around 1100PM with a group of six on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. We ordered a few bottles of soju that unfortunately we weren't a fan of (mainly because of the flavors we chose). We ordered a ton of food and it came out very quickly. We ordered the kimch-eese fries (amazing), sweet & spicy popcorn chicken (also amazing), the maze crispy sampler (decent), bulgolgi (really really good as you'd guess), sweet and sour chicken (great), anda  few other things I dont remember. Our group demolished all the food and were in and out in about 1.5 hours. It was a really good meal and an overall cool spot. The bar was really cool as well.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The pita sandwich stuffed with deep-fried and mashed chickpeas, a mop of lettuce, tomatoes and a slather of tahini was so tasty and served hasty. I'd give the falafels alone five stars. You can't beat this for NYC's cheap eats. Definitely want to go back for more. I can see myself eating this everytime I'm in the city.",1
"I visited Raku for dinner and I was really impressed. The udon was my favorite dish and it was definitely worth the trip. The broth was clear and flavorful and the mochi was soft and chewy. The chicken and Japanese leeks were also delicious and added a nice flavor. The ambience was dim lighting but very cramped, which made it hard to move around. However, it was definitely worth it for the delicious food. I would definitely recommend Raku to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"Enjoyed a good, quick brunch here! Shout out to Jayson our server. He was funny, friendly, and attentive. We ordered the 2 egg plate, avocado toast, and a side of chicken sausages. The side of chicken sausages come with the 3, so worth it for the price. The 2 egg plate was great and super filling. I had the avocado toast which was alright, wouldn't necessarily recommend based on my personal taste. Maybe would be better with a topping added, I added the arugula on top while eating and it tasted better. But some of the food other people were getting looked incredibly delicious. So I definitely think we should've instead had some french toast or pancakes! Good experience, would return with a different choice of food.",0
"The pizza here is definitely worth the price, and the staff is polite so it's a good option if you're looking for a cheap meal. However, the guy serving us was pretty grumpy and gave us a hard time when we asked for a cup, which was kind of rude. All things considered, it was a decent experience but I wouldn't recommend it if you're in a good mood.",1
"I had a great time at Still great. Still one of my fav places in the city. Had the crispy rice again. As another review mentions, it's truly crispy with every bite. Maybe the best rice I've ever had. I tried the fish tacos this time. Super good. The only negative I can really say is the fries weren't good - to mushy. The vibe of this place is just so fun. It's not touristy. It's more like cheers. Everyone wants to know everyone. Expect to make new friends while here. There's also a fun jukebox.

The only downside is that the fries were a bit too mushy for my taste, but that's really the only thing I could say negatively. The atmosphere is great and the people are really friendly. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I ordered the swordfish for delivery and it was the worst, most disgusting seafood dish I've ever had. How on earth can a fish be burnt and undercooked at the same time? No seasoning at all just terribly cooked. Refused to refund me and pretended they'd never heard of Postmates. Will never order from or visit here again.",0
"We had such a great experience at this restaurant! The food was amazing - everything tasted so good. The service was also excellent, and our server was so polite and informative. I definitely recommend giving this place a try - you won't be disappointed!",1
"If there's any NYC restaurant that I've been to endless times and I have happily given my repeat business, it would have to be Flex Mussels and that's both the UES & West Village branches. Hands down the very best Happy Hour, with such an incredible value for money without compromising both quality and quantity!



I usually go here with either my best friend or hubby and enjoy a glass or two of Vinho Verde. A dozen fresh oysters (usually from Prince Edward Island) is always a must, used to be $1 each but now at $1.50 during Happy Hour but still a great deal so we don't mind. Then it's on to the Mussels with Fries deal (used to come with beer but it was removed recently, again we don't mind) and we still have that wonderful option of upgrading it to Truffle Fries which I highly recommend. The San Marzano flavor is my go to mussels here as the tomato sauce and spiciness is a perfect blend. So delicious! And if we're particularly feeling indulgent and not counting calories that day (LOL), we get the donuts too. We love the cinnamon and sugar, chocolate and salted caramel. The",1
"Really good quality, reliable, and affordable Chinese food. While I wish New Golden Dragon delivered, I am so glad they exist! Their food is always tasty, and filling with large portions and very reasonable prices. What can you count on when you get take out from New Golden Dragon?+ You will always be greeted in a friendly manner and they will always show you your food to make sure they got your order right.+ the egg drop soup ALWAYS  have fresh scallions on top+ you  always will be offered a free soda or eggroll if you order total is $11++ their tofu is ALWAYS delicious!+ large portions always enough for 2 meals (dont worry if you choose their ridiculously cheap lunch special is also a very generous portion)",0
"I visited this restaurant for lunch and was pretty disappointed with the food. I ordered the vegetarian stuffed cabbage which was nicely stuffed with a kasha and vegetable mix. The mashed potatoes were cold and bland. On my way out, I saw a posted review, which described the food as bland and plentiful. Enough said.",1
"We have visited this place because of the awesome reviews and Michelin star so the expectation was really high. The decor/staff, great. Our server knew the dishes and was attentive during our dinner. Ordered apps- ghost chili chicken kebab (if you really love spicy food it's a must try) Bhatti murgh chop (loved the presentation and the taste ) basil fish tikka (felt it was bland ).  My group was disappointed in the main course, we had ordered paneer thikka masala (was expecting it to be more on the soft side and not fine) chicken thikka masala (both gravies tasted the same - (more on tomato and heavy cream), lamb curry was also okay. The naans and roti came out fine. Dessert was the star of the night, tried the daulat ki chaat ---it was amazing, you have to try it ! I would go again for apps and maybe give the entrees another try but for now , 3 stars from me until then.",0
"I found 3 stars to be average when it comes to pizza in Little Italy. The sauce was fresh and tasty, but it didn't stand out amongst the other restaurants in the area. The crust was thin and crunchy, which I thought was a nice change from the usual chewy crust. However, I didn't find this place to be particularly impressive. There are other pizza places in the area that are better tasting and offer a more impressive pizza experience.",1
"I went to Randall's Island, and this spot was right next to the 125th Harlem stop on the 4/5/6 subway stop.   The food here is good, but it is pricey.  I think it was $25 for 3 empanadas and a plate of pernil and chicharron with rice and beans.  I thought cochifritos were pretty good.  It was crispy, delicious, arteries clogging good.  He offered me some garlic sauce and it did live up to its hype.  I would return, but they have no bathroom or place to wash your hands...or space to really sit down and eat.  It has like four or five stools and a countertop.  It defines cozy.",0
"For a place that has so many positive reviews, I am pretty disappointed to give a mediocre rating. There were many people inside eating at a late hour, so I had high expectations. I ordered the stewed beef noodle soup without spice (I later added hot chili oil) to go, and it came out pretty quickly. However, it was really flavorless and bland. I had to add all of my hot chili oil to even taste anything, and the noodles remind me of the noodles inside canned chicken noodle soup. It doesn't seem authentic at all. I paid an extra dollar for pickled vegetables, which are supposed to be sour, but they ended up being bitter and flavorless as well. The only good thing about the dish was the beef. It was incredibly tender and I could easily break it apart with my chopsticks. I'm sure their other food must be pretty good, so I would come back to try their dumplings, but i don't recommend their stewed beef noodle soup.",0
This is a cute tapas place with a nice atmosphere. The staff is nice and the drinks were good. I wish the portions were a little larger and sized appropriately for the amount of people on the table when ordering. The churros stuffed with chili ate are so delicious and a must have!,1
Beautiful scenery. Awesome place for pics. Staff is absolutely wonderful but the food just wasn't that great. Dined with a friend for her birthday and we left hungry and dissatisfied. Steak definitely felt rushed and everything tasted a bit stale. The best thing for me was the crab cake...Maybe it was an off day. But the setting makes for a beautiful and romantic date night. I'd go back and try something different,0
"Shawnette is by far the best server I've ever had. I came to Applebee's to celebrate my nephew's birthday and Shawnette made his special day even more special. She was polite, she was informative, she was kind and she even sat and talked to my nephew to help him understand the menu. During this pandemic, good service has been difficult to find but Shawnette has definitely restored my faith in humanity. I am so lucky to have had her as a server and will continue coming to this location! Thank you all at Applebee's on 117th street.",0
"Honestly probably wouldn't come back because the food was just ok. Perhaps my expectations were just high with the idea of ""rooftop brunch"" - we were seated near the wall, so basically we had no view of the city which made Cantina feel like just another restaurant. They have these plexiglass walls set up between tables which made the dining experience safer and a tiny bit cozier than I was perhaps expecting of an outdoor rooftop brunch. I got the huevos rancheros, which is usually my go to Mexican food brunch choice - it came out lukewarm, the nachos were soggy, and the black beans were already congealed - which was super disappointing. My friends' entrees also came out lukewarm. The server filled our waters once in our whole meal, and after we asked for hot sauce the server never followed up to bring it. There are def there are better options in the city - our experience was just ok, and for the normal Manhattan rooftop pricing we expected better. Perhaps sitting out on the central to outer edges of the rooftop might have been better, but don't think we'll be back to see if so.",0
"Da Tang Szechuan is a great place for authentic Chinese food. The dishes we tried were all very good, and I especially enjoyed the pig trotters in spicy pickled mountain pepper sauce. The service was polite and the atmosphere was relaxing. The only suggestion I have is that they add plum juice to the menu, as it complements spicy food very well. Overall, I had a great experience at Da Tang Szechuan, and I'll be back!",1
"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. The staff is always so friendly and quick, and it's always busy during lunch hours. I usually get the chicken caesar salad, but if not, I usually get one of the seasonal salads on the menu. The salads are always fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
Very good lunch options to choose from. They have a lunch menu that has lots of options to pick from. Their curry's pack a lot of flavor,0
"I had a great time at Chloe, but I hate the location of this restaurant. The space is small, cramped, and crowded, unless it's some weird time like 3 or 4pm. The Greek salad is the stuff that salad dreams are made of, with tons of shredded romaine, perfectly seasoned tofu ""feta""-style crumbles, Kalamata olives, chick peas, cucumbers, capers and cherry tomatoes. The light amount of dressing allows the freshness to thrive. It's a delicious bowl of health. And that spinach artichoke dip is the perfect sinful companion. You feel like you're indulging for sure, but not to the point where you feel gross afterwards. And I've never had an air fry that was this close to the McDonald's version (damn me for still craving anything from that den of iniquity). That chipotle aioli tastes suspiciously like the real thing. But. I will never ever go back to this location during prime hours again. It's pure chaos, between third party delivery dudes storming in and out, people milling around by the tiny counter area up front waiting for their food (why don't they bring it out to you?!) and people trying to order,",1
"Nothing particularly special about this Thai restaurant, besides the fact that I can eat here comfortably during my 1-hour lunch break without having to wait or rush back to work. So whenever my coworker and I are craving some Pad Thai and want to ""treat ourselves"" during the work day/week, we just come down here for a nice table service meal. There's usually a good amount of customers that dine in, but it's never packed. The service is quick yet friendly. The complimentary shrimp chips w/ the peanut sauce dip is the perfect snack to munch on as an appetizer. I've only had their lunch specials which are about $12 for a noodle dish, curry, or fried rice, etc. (the standard) The food is good, but don't expect the fancy stuff. It's your typical Thai-American style spot that will satisfy any immediate Thai cravings.",0
"Randomly stumbled across this brunch option and was left very satisfied. The wait was a little over half an hour on Saturday around 11, so we went to a nearby coffee shop. The food was all excellent! The harissa folded eggs were great, well executed and flavorful. The hotcake was awesome and exactly what I wanted, though I wish I had asked for the syrup on the side (it was too sweet and drenched). The avocado toast was a hit. If you order bacon and prefer that it's crispy, you should request it that way. They default to making the bacon soggy and fatty here. Crowded seating, so you're sitting elbow to elbow. My only complaint is that the yelp waitlist feature was NOT working. When we came down it said there was zero wait at 11am, and it wasn't until about 2 minutes before we walked up that suddenly the Yelp waitlist estimated around 45 minutes. We would've put our names down sooner on the way over, or chosen another spot, but I think they forgot to turn it on when they opened, which was annoying.",0
"I LOVE Thursday Kitchen and have been coming here for over 3 years now. There is usually a wait on the weekends, but plenty of bars to kill time until you get seated. The service is always great here. The drinks used to be way better and stronger but they still look nice for a photo. Won't give you any buzz though.Any dish you order here will be amazing. We tried the asparagus dish for the first time and thought asparagus couldn't be anything special. This dish was so good though and had an amazing spicy creamy sauce to it.We also got our favorites of truffle Mac (it used to be better when it was less watery), and their take on sesame chicken. The chicken is crack - it's so addicting! We also love the kimchi paella which comes in a good size and plenty of seafood to share. The steak was great too and perfectly cooked. Came with an interesting side of grits too.Will always come back here!",0
Hmmm Golden Unicorn isn't what it used to be anymore! Very sad so short review here. Most of the items we ordered was pretty cold when it was delivered to our table. Our chicken feet was quite cold which is very upsetting because you must eat it while it's warm or hot! Ah our pork buns were very very oily! Why why why how can this be so wrong! Sad customer here. Please bring the old Golden Unicorn back,0
"Came here for dinner last Friday. There was an ample amount of seating available both indoor and outdoor at around 5:30pm. However by the time we left around 8ish, this place was packed! The service was excellent and they checked in on us frequently.Nacho Plate: A must order if you visit. It's delicious and beautifully presented. It came with fresh tortilla chips, MASHED black beans, pico de gallo, pepper jack and cheddar cheese, avocado sauce, sour cream, and topped with jalapeño peppers.Tacos de Pescado: I really enjoyed this taco. It was delicious and it came with catfish tempura, avocado sauce, cole slaw, chipotle aioli, and sour cream.Tacos de Pollo: This one was okay. I'm not a big fan of it. It came with pan-roasted chicken, cole slaw, roasted tomatillo salsa, and crema.Hardcore Lavender: I really enjoyed this drink. It's very floral with a subtle hint of lavender. It came with Botanist Islay dry gin, lavender bitters, lime juice, sugarcane syrup, and very very very tiny lavender flakes.Watermelon Jalapeño Margarita: It was good and refreshing. Definitely tasted the watermelon in this drink. It came with Hornitos tequila, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, watermelon, and jalapeño-infused cointreau.Oaxaca Express: This is their famous green drink but it tasted smokey from the mezcal. It came with 100% Espadin mezcal, jalapeño-infused agave nectar, cucumber, cointreau, and basil.Great food! Great drinks! Great ambience! Great service! Will be back!",0
"Stopped by with a friend for brunch. We ordered the mac n cheese, hash brown, vegan pancake and the giving tree pressed juice. This is bar far  the best vegan mac n cheese I've ever had! Theres the sweet potato cashew cheese sauce with the shiitake mushroom bacon on top. The hash brown was surprisingly good with its tofu sour cream and smoke paprika. Loved the variety of food items here. I'll definitely be back to try their spin on other dishes.",0
"The teh tarik is great, and the white coffee was also good. The Kaya toast was also good. The only thing I didn't like was that the nasi lemak smelled like fish. Otherwise, it was a good meal.",1
"Where do I start?!?!?!?!Didn't opt for soups because it was a steamy sauna summer dayBut what I did have and that is engraved in my brain is the kimchi pancake....And one of the ban Chan items which was the dried squid w spicy sauce that my taste buds kept thinking this is a savory jerky and I need a beer.The kimchi pancake is crispy mas I swore there was cheese in here....I could eat three of these by myself and call it a day it's sooooo good!The pork belly was okay...it comes precut but I wish there w more fatties in here or that the belly came whole and I could slice it? I don't know yet how I feel about this belly....The bulgogi was good but I wish it had a little more taste of grilling like that char crispy taste...though the beef itself has a good flavor....The Galbi beef was better, I could taste the char on this and it was super tastyTuna app is tasty....like a poke FReid chicken is a yeeeees, it's little bits of dark meat super tasty and fun...just got in temp. So watch outService is lovely And remember the pancake!",0
"Overall, I was not impressed with 2.5/5Koreatown. The food was mediocre at best, and the atmosphere was not particularly appealing. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Beyond Sushi is the best restaurant in the city, hands down! The staff is always so friendly and the food is always amazing. The mezze platter is my favorite dish, but the sliders, spanakopita, and chocolate chip cookie are also great. I can't wait to eat here again when things open back up!",1
I'm not much of a pizza person but I occasionally get cravings for it few times a year. You can imagine that would mean I'm picky with my pizza. I'm glad I stopped by here during one of those cravings. The crust was perfectly thin just the way I like it and it was a satisfying to bite into. Not too overly greasy either. The atmosphere is clean and they have a variety of seasonings and sauces for you to top it off yourself which I noticed was more than other places. I appreciated this a lot cause I like to add a lot to my slices. Definitely coming back!,0
"This place is really cute and has a really retro diner vibe. The employees were really nice and the shake I ordered was really good - I especially loved the creamsicle flavor! Unfortunately, it wasn't as creamsicle-y as I would've liked it to be, but overall I had a really great experience here.",1
A brand new but old style sushi restaurant. You won't find sou sauce or California rolls at this place. If you're not a sushi aficionado I don't appreciate what these chefs can you give you. Don't expect a lot of creativity with Omakasa each dish is just one piece of sushi. 10 piece and one roll for $70 or 15 piece and one roll for $100. I don't have a liquor license yet which works great for me because he prepared to bring your own bottle of sake which saves you lots of money. Services fabulous reservations are recommended I will definitely be back. The only dish I didn't like was the octopus and the shrimp everything else was amazing. Even a wagu beef.,0
"I absolutely enjoyed my hot pot experience here, probably the best I've had in the city!! Walking in, the restaurant felt very clean, like you know you'll walk out without smelling like hotpot. For Covid times, everything was well spaced out. Your order your soups/meats/veggies on an iPad. The soups are all individual which is great! Everything is a La carte. I picked the combo soup with the silver soup and Szechuan hot and spicy soup and omg they were both so good. The silver soup was a huge standout for me, it's so creamy and rich, it felt like a home cooked soup. They give you additional raw pig intestines, a date and winter melon to add to that soup so it feels like you get something extra. This is 100% a must get! The Szechuan was really tasty too, it wasn't too spicy, definitely oily but very flavorful and great for dipping meats in. All their meats and veggies were very presentable and the meats were high quality! Their soy sauce is really good too, definitely doesn't taste like your average kikoman but something else added. Their durian pancake is interesting and a must if you like durian! I love that they give you a good portion of froyo afterwards too, feels like a great palette cleanser.  Service here was excellent honestly, the waiters were all super attentive, came by to add extra soup, helped refilled your water, change out your fancy napkin, you name it! They give you a bib in the beginning as well so that you don't splash anything on your clothes. Obviously, only great things to say. We came on a weekday at 12:30pm and apparently it was happy hour so we got like $25 off our whole meal so for two of us, it turned out to be slightly less than $50 with tip! Pretty good tbh!",0
"So I wanted to get the flat bread they are famous for that is quite literally the size of your head! I got the pork filling, it was so good! The bread tastes kind of like naan and the pork filling like the pork belly you find in the center of bao buns,  can't wait to go back!",0
"I visited this restaurant for the second time and I had a great meal. The shakshuka was delicious--the egg was cooked perfectly. I was a little disappointed that it was a bit light, though. I would definitely come back here.",1
"I had a chance to try out this restaurant for the first time and I was a bit underwhelmed. The flavors weren't as exciting as I was hoping and I felt like the food was a bit bland. However, the chicken was moist and didn't come across as dry so props to them for that. I would definitely give them another try and try out some of the other food on the menu. Everything was neatly packed when we received our order, so kudos to them for that!",1
"Overall, I was disappointed with my experience at KOOK. The wait was frustrating, and the food was mediocre at best. The service was lackadaisical, and the food was not particularly well executed. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Went on a Saturday at 4 with my boyfriend and the experience was phenomenal! We sat at the bar and I believe the bartender's name is Gordon, he took care of us among other bartenders. He was awesome and funny! The spicy shrimp is AMAZING! And i don't like seafood too much.. their steak frites were cooked to perfection and the drinks were amazing too. What won my heart was the sweet potato side. It's basically dessert and served with ice cream...  i'm craving it every second. Overall it was an experience everyone should go and have when visiting the city. It's pricey but everything is worth it !! Will be back!!",0
"This little Korean kimbap hole-in-the-wall is hidden at the back of an American deli. It looks like cafeteria-style food, but that is essentially what kimbap is. A quick rice and seaweed roll, which some may call Korean sushi, though I find that name terribly incorrect, is easy to make and includes all pre-made foods. I ate the bulgogi kimbap and it was great. Convenient, quick, flavorful, and filling. It's a great snack, and could be a meal if you have a smaller appetite. It's not a high-end place, but it's Korean comfort food that brings back childhood memories.",0
"I stopped by Bangkok Street Food in hopes of finding a new restaurant, and I'm glad I did! The window sign advertised Khao Moo Tod, a dish of crispy pork belly over white rice with Jaew sauce. I was unable to checkout what could be part of the menu, as it's written in a low-light sitting. I was looking for appetizers and desserts, but there were none to be found. The Khao Moo Tod was good - the pork belly was cooked well and not greasy. By the time I left, there were plenty of take-out orders coming in. It seems that the online menu has more options than what you get in person. I'll definitely be back!",1
"A small Australian breakfast/brunch spot with pretty cozy vibes. I ordered Harissa Folded Eggs, Shoestring Fries. and a Cold Brew. The eggs were pretty good, the texture was soft and fluffy, but I was expecting something a little more. The toast, bacon, and avocado were just alright. The fries were good but nothing too great. The cold brew was also pretty average. I also got to try the Burrata Fig Toast which was a pretty good option if you want something sweet.Overall I don't know if the food is worth the price but I guess a part of it is the hype and whole brunch experience. Would recommend trying for yourself, especially if you are an avid bruncher.",0
"A beautiful space transformed. Having visited the previous bar location with little memory besides a nice bar, Il Fiorista has truly transformed the location with a flower theme and natural clean foods with great presentation to boot. So I passed on the flower menu, but the food certainly didn't disappoint.Sadly out of the Potato Sourdough, I had the seeded crackers to start and a fresh crudo that was finished off by a robust, but not too heavy duck capellacci. Eat bite was flavorful, meaningful, and delightful. It was obvious the ingredients were great and attention was paid to every detail. Also pleased with the service and the great knowledge and explanation of each dish on the menu.Overall, a splendid experience that you wouldn't expect and a beautiful experience that isn't over the top.",0
"Returned after many years.  Only had the meat lover's pie after learning they no longer do pastas after a recent fire. Pizza was very good, though a bit salty.  Service is super friendly.   Looking forward to coming back for the shroom pie.",0
"I highly recommend this ramen restaurant if you're ever in the area! The broth is absolutely delicious, and the noodles are perfectly cooked - with a great bit of bite. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit small, so it can be a bit crowded - but it's definitely worth the visit!",1
"The Times Square Diner is always open and always available, making it a perfect place to stop when in the area. The diner's menu is limited but includes a variety of breakfast items, such as eggs and bacon with home fries and toast. The coffee is fresh and the prices are reasonable. The service is friendly and efficient.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely fantastic - everything tasted really flavoursome and fresh. The atmosphere was really unique and engaging - it really felt like I was dining in a beautiful art gallery. The staff were really friendly and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. Overall, it was definitely a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",1
Thankful to have a new restaurant in West Harlem. Rolands took place of Nabe Sushi a few months ago and I tried it out on a Friday night. Made a reservation through Yelp Res but wasn't really necessary as I think people in the neighborhood are still figuring out that it exists. We had the Brussel Sprout salad and the dressing was delicious/addicting. We ordered one and then immediately got another. From there we had the white pizza with broccoli rabe and sausage. The dough was well done but I think that even if the broccoli rabe was a little crispier it would have been . The wait staff was really attentive and made sure that we were well taken care of so for a new restaurant I appreciated that. Looking forward to seeing how their food and presence elevates in the next few months. Will be back!,0
"I love Kati Shop for their delicious, fast casual Thai food. Their curries are my favorite, and their massaman curry is the perfect balance of spice and flavor. It's the only non-spicy curry on their menu, and it's perfect for those who want a hearty meal but don't want it to be too spicy. I also really enjoy it as the gravy to their mashed potatoes - something I would never have thought of doing with curry, but it's a great pairing. Everything I've tried there has been delicious, and I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!",1
"Always gotta start out by saying the service was top notch! They have a decide at the table, which they explain. Pressing a certain button will call the server to order, ask for water or to even pay your bell. However, we never had to use it! We were the only guests outside, the inside was packed, yet our waiter never forgot about us!I'd been hankering a nice Indian meal for a while and am now very glad that I held out for this one. The inside looks very nice but their out door space, which seats 4-5 tables is also nice and comfortable. We were also given complimentary papadum chips with mint chutney. Papadum's aren't as common over here as they are in other parts of the world and to see them in an almost tortilla chip form was not something I'd seen! Despite my hesitation they were delicious and that mint chutney had an excellent spicy kick to it! We ordered garlic naan, lamb jalfrezi (comes with enough raita for two) and the Konkani fish curry. That curry blew me away, delicious fish and just loved the type of heat coming from the curry.",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really nice and the food is delicious. I would definitely recommend it to others!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for a quick snack and drink and was really impressed. The service was friendly and quick, and the food was solid. I got the grapefruit-nade which was not overly sweet and was a bit tangy, really tasty and fresh. My favorite was the yubu we got the mushroom bulgolgi, crabmeat, beef bulgolgi and spicy tuna. The crabmeat had a nice balance of flavor and tons of crabmeat. The mushroom and beef were solid but I preferred the crabmeat more. The spicy tuna was a bit fishy so I didn't enjoy it as much but it wasn't bad. The tofu skin and the rice were well done for all the pieces, rice was nice and sticky and good texture. I would definitely come back and try the rest of the menu.",1
"Airy, bright (without being pretentious) Middle Eastern bistro offering some of the dishes that I previously have found difficult to locate across the City. Like Malawach with egg (formerly a favorite of mine at the now-rebranded Cafe Petisco) and jachnun (also a weekend special at 12 Chairs). I had the malawach for my main, and it was certainly denser than the Petisco version, but perhaps even more flavorful with the inclusion of s'rug. For the table, we sampled the hummus, served with an effective dallob of chili oil, and the fried cauliflower, particularly appetizing after a squirt of fresh lemon.Only minor complaint was slow service - it took quite some time for us to get our food. But will definitely be back!",0
"It was National Margarita day and we were out to celebrate another momentous occasion in the team.We got a margarita after a 30min wait, there were two bartenders and the place was packed to the brim. Everyone who had got the made up holiday Facebook - Instagram update was here. At least it felt that way.The Happy Hour here at Empellon is one of the best I've seen in the East Village. Tacos look good and so do the guacamole and chips.Worth another visit.",0
"I came to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly, it was empty. I decided to stay because I wanted to try their unique sushi donut. Because I was the only person at the store, I got straight to ordering and eating my bowls within a matter of a few minutes.

PokeTheir regular bowl cost $11.50. I always love poke because you can choose unlimited toppings. For the toppings that they had, it's pretty standard of most poke spots. But their house bomb sounded interesting. It's a tad bit spicy, but I liked it. The bowl itself is very filling!

And got free roasted nori sheets due to my yelp check in!

Sushi Donut

Thank goodness, they had it available. They make it fresh on the spot, so it does take a bit of time to make, which is totally understandable. After a whole bowl of poke, I had less stomach to ingest this donut. Its pretty heavy because it is made of rice. So I decided to split it with my friend. Its honestly not the easiest to split because the whole circumference is filled with different things. But overall, it was delicious. Its almost felt like a more filling onig",1
"After walking 20 minutes in the freezing cold winter weather in NY, we opted to check out Ichiran to see what the fuss was all about. This place exceeded my expectations in every way. From service to the ramen, all spot on and left me desiring to come back ASAP. By now, you've scrolled through the multitudes of reviews, so you know now that this is a non-tipping establishment. What a great way to start a meal! After about 10 minutes of waiting, we saw four open spots on the innovative booth display. The staff person told us to head over to our booths. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen ""light"" all the way for the dashi, oil, and spice. After about 10 minutes, a server rolled up the screen and placed my ramen in front of me. After another 10 minutes, I devoured it. If you're big eater, you'll need to order the kae-dama, which is an extra order of noodles. Luckily for us, the kae-dama was free due to some promo. With my kae-dama order, I also requested a side of black vinegar or Osukaran in Japanese. Apparently, it's homemade. I added a few drops of it into my soup and, wow, it really enhanced the overall umami of the the broth. I highly recommend it. When compared to other ramen places I've been to, what sets this place apart is the Tonkotsu broth and the ramen noodles. The broth was very flavorful, but not heavy it all. Keep in mind I did order mine light on the oil. The noodles were stretchy and each bite was perfect. For the area, I found the prices reasonable, but quite expensive since I don't live in NY. Service was hospitable and the overall restaurant well ran and clean.Enjoy slurping!",0
"Have wanted to come here for a while but didn't want to show up without a reservation.  So this time was able to make a last minute reservation on Yelp. On  a Sunday evening around 6 the colorfully but dimly neon lit, long and narrow dining room is only full in the front section but by 7 pm it was completely filled.  We sat in the back room in a kind of booth seat with hard benches but quite comfortable (you want to avoid the table at the very end which is literally right next to the bathroom).  Other than that, the food - menu is not extensive - was good and pretty much met expectations. A couple of the noodle dishes were rather bland, but the three cup chicken was very tasty, so was the fried rice with Chinese sausage, popcorn shrimp, chili dumplings., and the Chinese spinach was one of the best.  Was curious as to what interesting Taiwanese dessert they might have but they don't offer any at all.  Overall a good restaurant with relatively reasonable prices.  Wouldn't mind returning to try some of the other dishes next time we are in NY.",0
I've walked by this place a few times and was curious what they had to offer. I utilized the online ordering system on their website so I could just pick up and go back to work immediately.I got the Soft Shell Crab Bun which was pretty good. I would get it without the salad next time as it made the burger itself really dry to eat. I did enjoy the soft shell crab and the crabmeat which makes this burger really good. I'd probably be back again to try some other stuff on their menu.,0
"It's been a while since I visited EO, I had forgotten how good the cocktails and the bartenders are here. It was buzzing as usual. The best thing about the place (get the bartenders to be creative and go off the menu), is the staff. Right from the guy checking ID at the door, bartenders to the servers everyone is just so friendly! Sorry to have forgotten you EO, I'll keep coming back!",0
Service was outstanding. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. During the pandemic of COVID:19 I must say they been following all guidelines while still serving customers. I appreciate the fact you could still order to go food and drinks. You could tell once business is fully back open they would be in for a treat. Great decor. I enjoyed my drinks,0
"Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Morton's. The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. However, I would not recommend the mushroom and spinach side dish as it was too salty. The au gratin potatoes were also clunky and not very noteworthy. I would have preferred the mashed potatoes instead. The wine flights were also great and I would recommend getting one if you're looking to try a few different wines.",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. The food was good, and the drinks were good (although the mimosas can be a bit expensive). The only thing that I didn't really like was that it can be difficult to get a waiter to refill your drink, especially if you're getting it bottomless.",1
"I found this place when I was searching for places to eat in the vicinity of Washington square park. I've had Cuban food before, so when I found this place I couldn't stop obsessing about my chance to go. I made a reservation and decided on the seafood paella based on the photos posted on Yelp. I'm glad I did, although I'm not a fan of squid, I did like the paella. I'm not going to lie, I skipped around the squid, but I did enjoy the dish. I think it was well seasoned. The decor of this place makes me think that this is how Cuba would look. The staff were great, and I would come back.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was Ok. The dishes I ordered were all Ok, but the pasta was very salty. The cauliflower dish was done very well, and the dumplings of many flavors were great. The duck was Ok, but I wasn't really impressed.",1
"Joe's Pizza carries a lot of history being one of the older pizza shops in the city and it's fame spot in Spider-Man. However the food doesn't reflect the history or helpful nature of the staff. Joe's classic cheese slices were okay at best. The slice was very floppy and crust was burned. Although thin and light, it just lacked flavor. I would recommend visiting once out of completeness, but there is nothing special to see. P.S. Keep cash handy because they don't accept credit cards and the ATM outside the shop has super high fees!",0
"Got into the Chelsea Market early on a weekend, and decided to beat the lunch crowd and try the take-out counter at this place. It was the fastest way to get food rather than trying to brave the brunch crowd for inside seating. I opted for the clam chowder (around $5?) and the fish and chips (around $15?).  I don't really eat fries, so sadly I didn't really touch them.  The soup was basically serve yourself. The soup tasted fresh and was super hot. Quite filling. The fish portions of the fish and chips were small, but thick and perfectly done. Just wish there was more of the fish and less of the fries.",0
"Try: Crab Cakes, Mac & Cheese, Roll Combo and Mango Shrub!Why: Always a solid choice in Midtown, especially when my colleagues are visiting. We started with Crab Cakes and Lobster Mac & Cheese, which were both really good. I liked the chive cream sauce in the crab cakes. I also liked how cheesy the Mac & Cheese was and with the crumbs on top for texture. The Roll Combo is a lot of food! I actually liked the burger more than the lobster roll. It came with fries and a salad as well. I washed the food down with a Mango Shrub Margarita, which was refreshing. Notes: We came on Tuesday evening around 7pm and it wasn't too packed, so we got seated right away. The hostess was friendly. The waiter was nice and helpful, but could have been a bit more attentive. We had to track them down when we were ready to order drinks, and then ready to order our main courses. Spacious indoor seating area with a bar and multiple clean restrooms.",0
"Dimes on Canal Street is a great place to enjoy some delicious vegan food. The Earth Tacos were amazing, with a delicious coleslaw and grilled sweet potatoes. The perfect size for a nice lunch without feeling too full. The ACV green drink was refreshing. My friend had the egg tacos and the lemonade which was great (I had a taste). You had to eat outside due to Covid but they have ample seating and it was a beautiful day. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
I enjoyed every slurp and bite of my ramen bowl! The flavor alone was so filling and satisfying. Almost creamy! I had the Tenho bowl. It was a lunch special so it came with a bowl of rice topped with pork. I also had warm saki! Sorry I don't remember the name but I requested the most popular. If you really want to taste the saki request it warm not chilled. Personal opinion. The staff was attentive. I sat at the bar and ate. I loved every spoon!,0
"I visited this restaurant with my girlfriend and we both had a great experience. The Cheese Dakgalbi was delicious, and the toppings added great flavor. The only downside is that it was a bit pricey, especially for how small the portions were. However, we were able to get a discount for bringing our vaccine card, so overall it was a good value. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"I had a great time here with a small group. They have a varied menu of fun drinks. People in my group enjoyed both the breakfast and lunch foods that they ordered. My personal favorite was the chocolate chip pancakes! The portion size was plenty big for me. I ended up getting to take a pancake home :) It's a super fun spot in Murray Hill, I'm glad I gave it a try.",1
"The brunch at this restaurant was really fun. The $25 bottomless drinks deal is definitely worth it, and the options are really good. Unfortunately, none of the food was amazing. Some dishes were overcooked or dry, while others lacked flavor. But overall, we had a good time.",1
"I ordered the Special Bahn Mi Combo ($8.50), which consisted of pork roll, pork belly, pate, cheese, cucumber, cilantro, pickled carrot, and daikon. The bread was a little too tough to chew and break apart, but it tasted great with the sweet taste the Bahn Mi has. My gf got the Flank and Brisket Noodle Soup ($13.50), which is your traditional pho with flank and brisket. The ingredients appeared less in quantity than the average Vietnamese spot, but still filling. Overall, this is a pretty solid local Vietnamese spot in the area if you're craving Pho or Bahn Mi.",1
"The restaurant was nice and the waitstaff were friendly. However, I was not happy with the promotion they had advertised. The apps were full price and the drinks were not two for one. Overall, the restaurant was nice but the promotions could use some work.",1
"The Whitney's brunch was a lot of fun - the music was a bit too loud, but the food was great. The matzo ball soup was especially delicious, and the grilled cheese was also very good. Our waitress Clare was very attentive and polite - she's a beautiful woman and needs to be discovered by a cosmetics company! Overall, we had a great time at the Whitney and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant during COVID. The outdoor dining setup is really nice, with walls between each table and guarding you from the street traffic. The string lights and the candles were a nice touch. The food was just as amazing as it was before, and the service was great too - super friendly and attentive wait staff. I definitely recommend this place!",1
"I seen this place & yelp & I wanted to give it try due to great reviews. It's very spacious & they practice social distance. I got seated right away, & the server took my order right away. I ordered 2 Baja fish & Carne asada. My fish was ok, & Carne Asada was on point. I order margarita & it was different. It was strong  & it didn't taste good to me.  I was confused as to why my bill was $36. It was only me!! Overall my experience was ok, & I probably won't come back.",0
"When is a Bar not a Bar? Much like the question that bedeviled Alice when she was in Wonderland, I was left muttering this retort to myself after leaving Center Bar. Situated above the din of the Shops at Columbus Circle, Center Bar and the other high end dining establishments like Per Se, make up a rarefied 4th floor of high class and dining excellence. However, this doesn't seem to extend to Center Bar: not only were the bites I tried sub par (especially for the price), the service was also lacking. I ordered the Red Queen and an order of Sicilian Arancini balls, given the menu isn't designed for a full sit down meal (light bites and drinks meant to whet the appetite before plunging into one of the other restaurants perhaps?). My drink was brought with minimal haste, and the arancini balls soon followed. The Red Queen is poorly balanced as a drink, tasting more like Cranberry juice with some dry seltzer spritzed through it. While the arancini balls were tasty, especially with the use of arborio rice, they weren't anything more mind blowing than I would have gotten from the frozen foods section of the Whole Foods downstairs (which, come to think of it, makes me wonder how they were able to make these with little to no kitchen space). To top it all off, service was very light touch, not stopping by to check in and taking a while to come close out.",0
"Maybe I went in with very high expectations, but my bf and I stopped by for a quick bite and got the oxtail croquettes and then empanadas. The oxtail croquettes had good depth of flavor and tender oxtail but I thought the mangoes made the dish too sweet along with the sauce, and the shrimp empanadas were tiny and a bit dry.",0
LOVE.Sat outside and listened to a lovely live band while being served by a charming server and had excellent wine and homemade soup.A perfect experience.,0
"I really enjoy this bar. I think there is a nice aesthetic and there is a lot of seating and space. This is definitely a go-to for this area. They have a few drink specials, which is nice. My favorite thing is definitely the mood this place sets. I haven't yet been able to try any food, so I will update this review as soon as I do. Service has always been above standard.",1
"Pado is a newly opened sushi restaurant that offers omakase on their menu at a attractive price. Pado tasting: ($40) 8 piece chef choice nigiri sushi and a handrollBada tasting: ($50) 1 appetizer, 7 piece sashimi and 5 piece nigiri I brought my mom here to celebrate her birthday. I ordered the Pado tasting and my mom had the Bada tasting. The sushi pieces were pretty much the same except that her set came with sweet shrimp. The waitresses were very accommodating and sweet. I also think my mom was given extra pieces in her Bada tasting because it was her birthday.Overall, the fish was fresh and the price can not be beat for omakase. The only thing to keep in mind is that the pieces were very simple and plain as expected with the price. We didn't get any uni, caviar, truffles etc on any of our sushi but at least we had toro.We were seated at a table but I would recommend requesting for the sushi bar seating. My friends who went previously sat at the bar have had great experiences and seem to have gotten better pieces than I did. However, there are limited bar seating, since they only have about 4 seats in the back of the restaurant.",0
"I found the ramen here to be pretty standard. The broth was pretty good, but I didn't think it had as much noodles or meat as I would have liked. Nonetheless, it was a good value at only 9.99 without tax. I wouldn't actively seek it out, but it was a decent meal.",1
"Dim sum was dry, period. The cups had lipstick marks on them. My sister had to ask for a fork with food residue on it, PASS on this place- don't let the fancy chandelier fool you. I didn't even want to drink the water at that point.One star for an effective and fast witing list process considering the long lines.",0
"I really enjoyed the food over at Hak Box, but the menu is limited to only three items: rice noodle rolls ($2.50), stuffed tofu ($5/2pcs), and dumplings ($3/4pcs). On the bright side, you can sample everything for only $11. The most memorable of the three, in my opinion, is the rice noodle rolls. Unlike the Cantonese-style cheong fun, the rolls at HakBox are firmer in texture and more robust in flavor and size. The rice noodle base is dotted with salted pork and dried shrimp, rolled into a thick tube and topped with a scallion-oil garnish. Pure rustic, comfort food that is emblematic of Hakka cuisine-- intensely savory, filling, and delicious!",0
"Taking kraft to a new level, to the tastebud heavens!! I like getting toasted and and I loved the toasted bread crumbs on top, cilantro had a nice flavor TWIST, and the masala flavor was a cherry on top to bring this dish together! My tastebuds did miss some creaminess in the form of more cheese! It is Mac and CHEESE!! @hungryhungryhumans_",0
"Hatsuhana falls into an awkward category of sushi where it's a bit too corporate and austere (and pricey) for a fun, casual sushi gathering with friends, yet not indulgent/high quality enough to be meant for a splurgey celebration dinner. It's the ""radical middle"" of a sushi dinner.The thing that they're really known for is the Box of Dreams ($48) which has 9 squares of various sashimi (about 2-4 pieces each) over beds of rice. It's more food than it looks, and I was pretty stuffed by the end of the meal.Service is out of your face (in a good way) yet effective (e.g. water always re-filled). The ambience is very quiet and filled with business dinner types, making it a weird spot for a weekday date night (maybe better on a weekend).",0
"I had been to another Friedman's in the 30s and thought this would be a good place for lunch.  However, the same issue happened here that happened in the other location- it took forever to get water. And then the dishes took a long time to get to us as well. And then the hamburger and fries weren't hot  I ordered a chicken kebab type salad so that was good. The bathroom door is definitely different- it slides and you have to hook it shut. It is a unisex bathroom. I think of this place as something for everybody! But now it has two strikes...",0
"This place is definitely geared towards young people - the ID check definitely felt like a sign of their willingness to create a fun and welcoming atmosphere. The music from the 2000-2010s was really fun and added to the overall experience. The bar was pretty understaffed when I visited, and drinks were taking a while to come - but overall, it was a great time. I would definitely recommend this place as a fun spot to go with friends.",1
"Beyond Sushi completely exceeded my expectations- from its hip ambiance to its fast and friendly service, to its delicious faux-sashimi sushi that tasted too close to actual fish. My friend and I ordered the rainbow special roll and the spicy mango roll to share, and we thought it was the perfect amount of food for a light but satisfying dinner. I especially loved the rainbow roll- the salmon not only looks, but also tastes, so real. To top off our sushi entrees, we got the matcha ice cream pizzookie made with avocado- every bite was absolutely divine! I'm definitely making one more trip back for this (and try more of the menu) before leaving NYC. Additionally, Beyond sushi is also extremely affordable and makes for a slightly classy but casual weeknight dinner- it's about $20 per person if you split 2 rolls and a dessert! Overall, I highly recommend checking out Beyond sushi if you are in New York. Whether you are vegan or not, Beyond sushi will wow your taste buds!",1
"Yesterday,  I participated in a pizza crawl that my friend organized.  This was the second stop.  We had fifteen attendees.  Hence, the wait for two plain pies was an hour.  There was a long line for people ordering slices.  I enjoyed it.  However, it was a little oily for my taste.  Thus, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.   I still recommend it though.   The cheese was freshly made and the crust was thin.  Moreover, the crust wasn't burnt.",0
"I came to this restaurant to watch the Super Bowl, but unfortunately the space was very crowded and the service was poor. I had a reservation for a large table, but there were only a few servers working, so it was difficult to get someone's attention. I ordered the nachos, and they were tasty. I also ordered a vodka gimlet at the bar, but it didn't taste like a gimlet and was very watery even though I asked for it up and not on the rocks. Another surprise that they didn't have top bartenders on staff during the Super Bowl. I don't think I would return to this restaurant, especially not for cocktails.",1
"I usually come here for brunch alone when I want to treat myself, or just have a day to myself. I like coming here on weekday mornings/early afternoons because it's slow and quiet, and I like the ambience. I've gotten the pancakes a few times and they are always really good. The coffee is meh; it's typical diner coffee which is a tad disappointing considering this place is supposed to be fancier. Service is great though. My water and coffee are always refilled consistently throughout my meal and I have been asked a few times about whether I am enjoying everything, by both managers and wait staff. I haven't ordered much of anything else on the menu so can't speak to that but I will be back the next time I feel like splurging a bit.",0
"I was so excited to try New Golden Dragon, as I love Chinese food. I was not disappointed! The quality of their food was great, and the portions were large and very affordable. The egg drop soup always has fresh scallions on top, and their tofu is always delicious. I also really loved their large portions. I was able to eat my meal for two meals, and didn't feel guilty about it. I would definitely recommend New Golden Dragon to anyone looking for good, affordable Chinese food.",1
Terrible customer service experience. I brought friends here that were visiting.  We ordered 3 items - no customizing or changes.  They brought our order to the table next to us.  Once they realized the error they had to remake the order. We waited and told them we were in a rush because my friends needed to catch a plane. They brought the remade order and 2 of the items were wrong. Again we wait. Finally we got the right items. Breadsticks were warm and hardly cooked. Salad had way too much dressing. Friends said the pizza was good but after all the screwups they didn't even give us any discount on the bill.,0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The space is large and well-staffed, and they have a great variety of soup dumplings (I tried the pork ones) as well as an extensive menu. The hot and sour soup was great, and the price was very reasonable. I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great lunch experience!",1
"I guess I'm going against the grain here but for $70 to get two dry entrees... I'd expect some more flavor.So instead, it's bland, and although it feels lighter than your typical fare the dishes we got tonight both need a sauce. The lemon chicken tasted like butter and was vacant of all lemon.The Caspia meats were equally as dry and the same flavorless meats slapped on a plate with a faint breeze of what maybe resembles something that might one day hit the taste buds... Just unfortunate they they charge such astronomical fees for a prayer that the food will get better after another bite (it doesn't)Maybe that's harsh but I separated with a lot of money and would have been happier with the halal cart outside.",0
This is the best Mexican chicken and vegetable soup I've ever had! The soup was very hot and the chicken was delicious. The rice was also very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.,1
"The Lobster Club is Back! And better than ever!! Pre-Pandemic we were regulars at The Lobster Club and have been anxiously awaiting its reopening. It is back and hasn't missed a beat. The food, cocktails, service and ambiance are all excellent. Truly a wonderful experience. Yet another sign that Midtown has come back. We will be back very soon.",0
"I wanted to like this place, since I'm a big ramen fan. Went a few times and tried various bowls, before posting this review.



The pros are that the decor is cool looking, the ok ramen is decent, and the product is there. However, the cons are that the food is too costly for what you get, the portions are meagre, and the pork is a no-no in my book. The dishes are ""inventive"" in ways that I'm not fond of, and the service is slow and disinterested. The place is also full of foodie poseurs taking food pics and talking loudly about how important their self absorbed lives are instead of eating. The wait, hallmark of a true ramen place, is you get in order eat then leave...this isn't that place. multiple times I came here had to wait.



In the end, come here if you want to eat ok ramen at a hip looking place full of poseurs while being under-served by waitstaff. There are many other ramen places in the city to try, this is just one. Just one person's opinion.",1
"I went to the halal cart at the corner of 9th and Bleecker Streets and it was really good! I really like the white basmati rice they use here, it's different from the yellow or orange rice used at other carts. The chicken is also really juicy and the fajita-style chicken over rice is a lot of flavor. The only downside is that the chicken over rice isn't as good as some of the other carts I've been to, but overall this is a great cart.",1
Even though I was order challenged on this visit I still love Boulud Sud. You can have the chefs food all over the city but this is a much fancier place for a nice night out. The Mediterranean food reminded me of trips to Turkey and the open restaurant is super inviting. The cons here are that a glass of wine is $20+ for just ok wine and my last meal there was pretty fishy. I would stay away from the lemon and calamari pasta. Everything else we have had is amazing! Great for anniversaries!,0
the fact that this place is right across the street from my crib isn't the only reason why i frequent this place. the hand rolls are INSANE!!!!!!!!i love that you get sets of handrolls to try them all out... i go crazy for the Hokkaido Scallop hand roll. this is a fantastic place to bring your out of town friends with no craziness or stuffy crowds of people. perfect location- as it is right on the corner of Delancey and Allen. the music is always hip hop. i love it.,0
I'll always stay true to Ramen Nagi but I honestly can't compare it because Ichiran only has Tonkatsu and it was sooooo bomb! I love that you can customize the soup the way you want it and the experience of sitting in your own closed space is kinda fun too. I came here shortly before they opened and there were just a couple people in front of me. Definitely will be back!,0
"I agree with the other reviewers. It was ok pizza, but not classic NYC pizza. A good place if you are tired and don't want to spend much money! $1.99 for a cheese slice and slices with toppings range from $2.50 to $2.99. I would recommend this place if you are tired and starving:",0
"Sacco wasn't our first choice but the place I had been wanting to try was closed today. It was the highest rated option that was the shortest distance away. Also, we had just arrived in NY after a flight, and we were quite hungry. I can't say it was the best, but it definitely wasn't the worst. It looked like NY pizza, but the grease drippage wasn't great, at least on mine. Flavor was ok. For $3 a slice, it did the job. Slices came out fast, so at least there wasn't a wait. I wouldn't run back, but in a similar circumstance, I'd go again.",1
"Update: came back and loved it even more! I tried the truffle honey ricotta with bread, the aperol spritz, garganelli, gramigna and vodka pasta. What stood out the most to me was the gramigna, it's so different. The olive oil cake was okay for me. Overall, I love it here and the service and nice and friendly too.",0
"We had a great time at the new spot near the Met. The waitstaff were friendly and attentive, and the space was beautiful. The food was great, too - we had the tomato salad with Mozzarella di Buffala and the summer green salad with figs, walnuts, dates and goat cheese. The breadsticks and sourdough bread were a nice touch. We'll definitely be back!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The young lady up front was a living doll, and the server was top notch. He was attentive, funny, and obviously a real pro. I went with the green bowl and salmon, and it was very good. My daughter ordered the burger and my son an Amazin' pasta dish. Both were delicious. I also ordered watermelon juice mimosas, and they were OMGeee! Definitely a place to try out. However, it's popular, so make sure everyone in your party gets there on time. It's worth the wait.",1
"I had a fantastic time at Cafe Mogador! The drinks are delicious, the food is delicious, and the service is amazing. Our server was so sweet and attentive, and she made sure to keep us well-informed about the menu and the specials. I can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious offerings!",1
"I am Japanese and have eaten curry at home my whole life.  This curry was only average - the sauce was thinner than I would have liked and there were only 3-4 cubes of beef and a few veggies in the Japanese Classic with Beef Curry that I ordered.  I asked for it extra spicy and it wasn't even mild.  Nice outdoor space for dining, but I think I prefer to make my Japanese curry at home with a thicker sauce, more meat and more veggies.",1
Decent Cuban sandwich- thought the plantanos are under seasoned and lackluster. Only ordered delivery so will update if I ever make my way over to the location in person.,0
"I ordered takeout from Tri Dim Shanghai for the first time on Friday. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and it was ready within 30 minutes.When I took it home, I inspected the items and I was fascinated to see that they put the eating utensils, sauces, napkin, and fortune cookie into a small ziplock bag. This makes presentation a lot cleaner and it makes it easier to find what you need because everything is in one place. Other Chinese restaurants just throw the items into the bag, so kudos to Tri Dim!The shrimp fried rice tasted like shrimp fried rice, which I was happy about. Additionally, all of the shrimp were deveined. This excited me because some restaurants don't devein the shrimp. I'm usually okay with eating that part. However, I try to make sure it is removed whenever possible/convenient. Since Tri Dim does remove it, they get brownie points in my book.Although my fortune read ""There is a sparkle in my eye,"" the cookie was stale. VERY stale.",0
I had a great time at Philippe! The food was amazing and the service was great. This guy took me on a date here and I really enjoyed it. I loved the food so much that I even told my date he was coming home with me. I would definitely recommend Philippe to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
Patsy's is a must-visit restaurant in Covid. The thin crust pizza is the best I've ever had and the price is very reasonable. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.,1
"Nice ambiance in the back room and the food was tasty. They have a few vegetarian and vegan options, but it's not extensive. The eggplant tofu with spicy garlic sauce was good and the service was pretty quick (it wasn't crowded). They only have white rice.",0
"Fantastic Farida's is a great place to go for a delicious meal. The owners are very friendly and accommodating and the waitresses are quick and efficient. The food is excellent, and the prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I revisited Locanda Verde and was happy to find that the food was as I remembered it. The beet and pappardelle were both excellent, and the lamb had a few dots of overcooked meat, but overall it was a good meal. The ravioli was particularly good, and I'm happy to report that the restaurant has held up over time. This is a good thing for anyone who decides to eat here, as it shows that the food is of good quality and can be enjoyed by multiple generations.",1
"I had a delicious, Covid safe lunch here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We had later reservations but so got their early and they happily seated us then. We sat near window-it was not crowded in the bar area. I had fish tacos which were hearty and substantial. Very delicious and probably one of the best I've had! I would have liked a bit more crema sauce on the side. Prices are extremely reasonable. Fish tacos were $18. I had a Diet Coke which came in a ridiculously NYC skinny glass but he did not charge for refills $2. We had the churros for dessert and they were fantastic! Warm and sugary. It came with 5 pieces with dulce de leche sauce. Service was friendly and excellent. They do not participate in restaurant week. Thanks for a great lunch! Great ambience and music.",1
"My friend and I had dinner here at 5PM on Sunday. We did make a reservation but it looked like it would be easy to get a table at that time. We did see more people walk in later in the evening, so plan accordingly! I thought everything we got was solid. The roti was thin, lightly crispy and served as a great app/side. The beef rendang was yummy, the beef tender and curry having nice flavor. We got the char kway teow noodles which I thought were great. I love broad flat noodles. Texture was perfectly chewy. I also appreciated that the sauce wasn't too salty. I find that sometimes these types of noodle dishes can taste too salty or overpowered by soy sauce taste, but I thought this had a good balance. Portion size is good too - my friend and I were FULL from this meal. And I'm a big eater.I'd say Laut is a solid spot if you are craving SE asian cuisine!",0
"One of my friend's birthday is on Valentine's Day, so she organized her birthday dinner on Valentine's Day at Codino that my boyfriend & I attended. We had such a lovely time - The food, ambiance and service were great!To set the ambiance, since it was Valentine's Day, the restaurant ceiling was covered in red balloons! With the dim, romantic lighting, and exposed brick walls, the restaurant truly looked magical! The servers were very warm & welcoming and explained the wine list & menu, and we decided to share a couple bottles of wine, some small plates and each order a meal. The cool thing about the menu is all the small plates are $14 and the entrees are $16, which I think is pretty reasonable for NYC. We were a party of 7 and shared the following:Small plates:-Crostini di Pulpo - Octopus dish-Burrata Special - Prosciutto wrapped burrata (my favorite of the small plates!)-Tortino di Granchio e Funghi - Crab & shrimp cakes-Calamari in Umido-Cozze Marinate - Sauteed MusselsEntrees:-Truffle Gnocchi Special -(my favorite of the pastas; we all had a taste of each others who were willing to share lol)-Gnocchi Sorrentina - Tomato sauce-Maccheroni al Tartufo - Truffle Mac & Cheese-Tortelloni d-Aragosta - Lobster Ravioli-Tortelli Prosciutto e Piselli - Tortelli with prosciutto, peas and cream sauce (my dish)-Filet mignon The server also brought out a bunch of birthday treats for my friend on the house, which we all shared and enjoyed! We really had a lovely time and I would recommend the spot to anyone for a birthday, date, or weekend dinner.",0
"Okay cantonese roast meat spot (hit and miss)Pipa Duck would be my favorite so far. It's crispier thin skin, less greesy, very tender meat.Cuttlefish - i thought it's interesting to see this in a roast meat shop. Great texture and with the sauce it's really good mix.Honey Roast Spare Rib - it was on the dryer side.Honey Roast Chicken Wing - not tender not yummy :(Roast Pork - not bad but I'm not a roast pork person.It's a really affordable place with varieties but quality could be improved a little.",0
"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but was unfortunately disappointed. I ordered the hobbit and the million dollar roll, and while the rolls were delicious, I felt that there was too much going on. The fish didn't taste fresh, but may have been masked by the creaminess. I would come back and try a good old fashioned piece of fish on lump of rice (aka OG Japanese sushi), to see what all the hype is about.",1
"The restaurant has a decent atmosphere, but the food wasn't spectacular. The wild Japanese yellowtail sashimi tasted like what all good-quality sashimi tastes like. The soy poached Alaskan black cod was way, WAY too sweet for my taste. And the black sesame ice-cream was fine but hardly artisanal or homemade. Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon, but I've always found the concept of ""upscale Korean food"" to be an oxymoron. Like high-end dim sum. Paying twice the price for food that was always meant to be simple and humble. But that's NYC gastronomy for ya.",1
Came here for dinner and it was a good experiencePros:- Prices are lot more reasonable compared to Sakagura next door. I know Sakagura serves higher quality food but for a millennial the prices here are great- The skewers and soba noodles were delicious.- Ended the meal with Lady M crepe cake Cons: - None!,0
"(3.5 stars) Dinner here was a mixed experience. The rice dishes were the stars, my curry nanban not so much. Loved the grilled eel and the tuna and salmon sashimi, would order any of those next time. For my dish, the curry nanban was just so think and heavy with very little chicken. Though I enjoyed the noodles a lot, I was hoping for more of a broth, but it felt more like drinking a sauce.",0
"This place is not bad for a quick Japanese fix. It reminded me the stands at Mitsuwa Supermarket, which there were many things that you choose from. The only part confused me was how to get the food. Sometimes the staff brought to your table, sometimes they call you to pick up from the counter.",0
"Was at Prince St Pizza during the quarantine.  There was still a line but went fast with most on line from the delivery services.  Precautions were taken including 2 max customers, takeout only and plexiglass in front of cashier.   As for the slices, they were good, I'd give them a 7 out of 10. Solid sauce, OK crunch, not a lot of oil/grease.  I favored the margherita slice over my Sicilian.  If this was regular times, I wouldn't recommend waiting if the line is extremely long. This is NYC - plenty of solid options around.  Also $9.50 for 2 slices seems a lot for what it is.",0
"I enjoyed my experience at Maki Kosaka!!! I personally believe that if you want to come and try their food, do try their handrolls not the regular rolls! HANDROLLS! They were absolutely amazing and fun to roll yourself! The fish are fresh! They are more about the original taste of the fish. The food and service was absolutely great but there just wasn't anything special about this place to give it a five star. Like I personally felt like the regular rolls wasn't worth ordering here. But I do recommend coming here for the experience and trying their HANDROLLS!",0
Would I come back: I'd consider it.Food: Ribs - 3/5 - Pretty standard taste and it was slightly on the drier side.Pulled Pork - 3/5 - It was a smallish portion.  The sauce made it wet but I'd say the sauce wasn't infused into the meat.Sweet Potato Mash - 3/5 - Not a typical dish I get with my bbq usually.  I wasn't blown away by it and it was interesting.Service: 3/5 - Average service.Ambiance: 3/5 - A casual spot and I came here just before heading to the airport.,0
"Good place for casual brunch. A little pricey for what you get, but not too far off from NYC standards. My Mediterranean Breakfast Platter was yummy. The bathroom is through the hotel lobby which is a but if a pain.",0
Paris Baguette on Lexington near East 86th Street is my favorite location.  I've been visiting here since they opened years ago. It's always clean. These days I enjoy sitting at the counter near the window. I'm away from others. I usually get a pastry or coffee and eat and run. I can't say enough about the delicious delicacies they offer. I've tried various and there's always something new. My current favorite is the Everything Croissant with cheese inside. It's so greasy and yummy! I've never had a problem with customer service. They are well trained employees efficient and neat in appearance. They have free WiFi. I'm raising their stars to Five.,0
"Eh not super impressed. The favorite was most likely the potato's, they were super crunchy and flavorful. The octopus, while soft, had no flavor at all. The shrimp and garlic was actually pretty good, but they were tiny and are only given three pieces of bread.",0
"Meh. I would not recommend this place, esp when there is so much other good Chinese and Taiwanese food in the city. The pork and chive steamed dumplings were probably the best though pretty standard. I was not a fan of the chicken mix they use for the chicken dumplings or the chicken soup. Not sure I would come back.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying Veselka, based on the high ratings and great photos on Yelp. However, my experience was not great at all. I ordered the apple crumble cake, which unfortunately did not have whipped cream as per the photos - it was microwaved and parts were hard. Additionally, the blintzes were slightly better, but small for $10. That's $8 for a blintz + an additional $2 for a tablespoon of raspberry compote. The atmosphere seemed more about ushering people in/out as quick as possible, and the prices were high considering the portion sizes. The service was fine, but seemed incredibly rushed. Overall, I would not recommend Veselka - it's not worth the price or the mediocre dessert experience.",1
"I was contemplating leaving a review here since there wasn't much to say about the food but I felt compelled to write one after such a horrible experience with the service.We waited at least 20 minutes just for someone to take our order. As we were waiting for our food, we couldnt help but notice at least 2 other tables having the same experience as us. They waited long, and even as they tried calling a server's attention, the servers seemed to have great expertise in ignoring tables. They walked past several times, just as they had done with us, and kept doing other 'important' things.My two cents: either they are very disorganized and/or are very inefficient. In any case, there wasn't much else to say here because we would have walked out if we had to wait any longer to be served.",0
"What a fun, unique dining experience! Spotted this place from another Yeep's review, and so glad I bookmarked Zauo for our NYC getaway. Clean decor, warmly lit interior, and multi-level fishing/catching/dining space. A mesmerizing vertical LCD screen display of aquarium-like footage welcomes you upon entering, along with the blue tank of rainbow trout & striped bass. Upper level tanks house the lobsters and flukes&flounders. As many others have said, you can choose to catch what you eat live and select various ways of prep: soft boiled, hard boiled and tempura for lobsters; tataki, grilled, sake steamed, soy simmered, and tempura for the fish. We had our lobster hard boiled, tempura'd, and miso souped; our rainbow trout sake steamed and tataki'd. Beautiful presentation and absolutely scrumptious!  We also got the wasabi tako and seaweed salad apps. Very very flavorful. Pricey but worth its special, one-of-a-kind dining experience!",0
"I recently visited Thai V Express and had the Vegetarian Duck salad. While the salad was good, I did not enjoy the sauce that it was served with. I am not sure if the sauce was made with fish, but it definitely had a fishy smell and taste to it. This is not a safe place for vegetarians, as the sauce could potentially make them sick. However, the food is great for meat-eaters, as the duck salad is delicious.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The quality really deteriorated due to the couple of changes that they made to the dish: 1. There used to be a variety of mushrooms, but now there's only one type - the enoki one. Moreover, less mushrooms than before in general. 2. The konjac noodles aren't tied in knots anymore, just swimming around in thin strands, which makes them difficult to eat and splatter spicy broth all over. 3. Smaller portion and inexplicably less spicy than before. It appears that they're just doing subtractions all over. Look, I get it - inflation has been tough on everyone, but I'd rather they raise the price than reduce the quality.Sad to downgrade this place because it was absolutely my favorite Chinese restaurant in the city, and I'd been recommending it to everyone! I'd converted so many of my friends into recurring customers. Needless to say, I won't be back anytime soon.",1
"I had a great time at Oyster Depot's happy hour. I ordered three littleneck clams, three bluepoint oysters, New England clam chowder, and the vodka oyster bartini. The clams and oysters were both very meaty and fresh, and had no sour flavor at all. The clam chowder was also great, and went well with the crackers. The only thing I didn't care for was the vodka oyster bartini. It just tasted like straight vodka to me. Overall, though, I had a great time at Oyster Depot's happy hour.",1
"Have dined at Buddakan twice and will definitely return. As is my usual MO on my last visit, my eyes were larger than my stomach and I was tempted to order nearly everything on the menu. Fortunately my dining companion stopped me after ordering the fifth item. :-) We had the lobster egg rolls, cheesy cauliflower lollipops, oxtail dumplings, tuna tartare spring rolls, and the banana cheesecake. We enjoyed each dish and I really wish I could have tried even more. Next time. Service on my last visit was a bit slow and spotty. We waited over 10 minutes after we were seated to get water. It took a long time for us to have our drink and food order taken as well. Our server didn't come much during the meal either. The restaurant itself is really nicely decorated. It's dark with a red glow and a large amount of seating space. Very unique and almost like what you'd expect from a nightclub. The restaurant was very busy as it remains a popular destination. The bathrooms were unisex and desperately needed attention. There was urine and sheets of toilet paper all over the floors. It was disgusting. No excuse for a restaurant this nice to fail to maintain clean restrooms throughout dinner service.",0
"Got take out and was disappointed by the quality and flavor of the sushi. We got the edamame and chicken gyoza as appetizers. The edamame was ok, but did not have any salt and the gyoza were tasty. The sushi rolls were a let down. The texture of the rice was not right (tasted like paste rather than rice grains) and the rolls did not have much flavor. I tried the salmon avocado, spicy tuna and shrimp tempura roll. The prices are not cheap and honestly I have had far better sushi in the neighborhood. I would not go back for the sushi.",0
"The atmosphere was cozy and the service was friendly. The menu offered a variety of options for brunch, including items for vegetarians, vegans, and gluten-free diners. The coffee was reasonably priced and the servings were ample. Our broccoli scramble was delicious, and the biscuit accompanying it was also good. The only downside was the jam on the biscuit, which was overpowering. The cheese grits were a real standout, though, and would definitely recommend them.",1
"I had a great time at Sei Less! The edamame and chicken dumplings were amazing, and the spicy tuna crispy rice was fantastic. The lobster noodle had a bit too much pepper for my taste, but otherwise it was a great dish. The lobster vegetable fried rice could have been better, though. The vegetables in the rice were undercooked and too hard. I also only had about 2 pieces of lobster in the rice. The passion fruit prawns were fantastic, though. I would definitely recommend Sei Less for a girls night out! Danny, our waiter, was hospitable and knowledgeable. The vibe at Sei Less is definitely hip hop, which can be a lot of fun.",1
"Boy oh boy did I miss Burger & Lobster during the pandemic. But they are back and better than ever!! The menu is still the same; a variety of burgers, lobsters, and combo meal. But you don't need to do a lot, if you perfect what you do! This time I got lobster Mac and cheese and a crab cake for my appetizer. The lobster Mac and cheese was creamy with chunks of lobster.  We ate every last bite. The crab cake, while delicious, was a little small for that price tag. But it's also a restaurant in the city, so prices are gonna be high. I had to get the original lobster roll again, since that's the whole reason I came back!  From start to finish I enjoyed every single bite, and I can't wait to go back again.",0
"After walking all around Manhattan and Brooklyn, my bf and I were craving some good ol' hot pot. We had to wait a little while but were seated with 2 other couples in a shared area. We didn't mind though. We did the AYCE hotpot & chose their regular / spicy hot pots. We were served in two separate mini pots. I would say it was decent hot pot and service was attentive. I really enjoyed the fact that they served crab as well with no additional charge. The soups were a little bland but we didn't mind. They have a sauce bar as well! That was a plus. After a long day, it was the perfect hearty meal we needed. We ended the meal with some self serve ice cream.",0
"Came here for a quick lunch with a friend on a weekend. Ordered a few dishes, samosa, rice and naan bread to share, it was so good. My fave is the murg saag - seems they use dark chicken meat rather than white meat so it's nice and tender. The Palak Paneer was also tasty. Service was good and the restaurant is nice and clean. Would definitely be coming back here again soon!",0
"What a mistake!  I have a tradition of eating something at Hard Rock before I collect the t-shirt. Should have eaten elsewhere. Such slow service. This place shouldn't be open if they can't get enough servers to help them. Servers were rushed and ours was not friendly. He's got too much to do to be friendly. Actual food was good but took over 30 minutes to get food after we were finally able to order. Water glasses sat empty for looooong time. By the way, fries with wings are $5 extra. My bad for saying yes when he asked...because he did not say it was an extra charge. Cheesecake was meh.  Wait for Juniors cheesecake around the corner.",0
"Random drop in just short of 7, before an 8o'clock curtain at Lincoln Center.  No problem, said the boisterous host, with a broken fork tie clip, two wives in his past, a giant smile and a can-do sweep of an arm.Seated immediately amidst a giant press of folks, with a speed record for a sausage fennel pizza, fried roman artichokes (not to be missed) and a remarkably great fettuccine bolognese. The later was a safety dish, ordered as a low risk, but it shone big.   And a super vino noble red.   All in time, no pressure, just pleasure, in food and wine for 3, and a walk to theater with time to spare.    And a Great waiter",0
"One of the best antidotes to quarantine or anything else that bothers you is a big portion of Ponche's housemade tortilla chips!  For #bignightin, we ordered their delicious guac and chips, to start.  Perfect, could've gotten 2 orders and just pigged out on that!But hubby had a vegetable burrito and I had the vegetarian enchiladas w queso fresco.I walked over to pick it up and we had a filling feast for dinner!We hadn't even realized they were open until we happened to walk by a few days ago and grabbed a takeout menu.  Made my day!",0
"I'm so excited to finally be able to go to this restaurant again! The metal gate was up completely yesterday, and they are officially reopening on July 1st! Welcome back!",1
"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. The lunch special is always pretty good and the tempura is really crunchy and tastes great. It's a small place so it's not the best place to come to eat, but everything I've had here has been great.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at Le Coucou. The service was excellent, and the food was especially good. I especially loved the foie gras, which was beautifully presented and very tasty. The prices are a bit high, but overall it's an excellent restaurant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great French meal.",1
"The cafe is small, with a kitchen and ordering counter, as well as 2 tiny tables with 8 seats. The food was good, with a small beef rice noodle roll for $2.5 and a curry fish ball for $2.5 both good. The only downside was that the food seemed premade and not freshly made, and the curry sauce was just ok. It's cash only, so be prepared to carry some cash.",1
"Had to wait approximately 15+ minutes to get a few slices on a Friday night. So definitely not a grab and go pizza, but definitely worth the wait. We had to try and make our movie reservations so we grabbed whatever that was available. Ordered 3 plain & 2 pepperonis and I felt like it was nothing special. Typical NY slice, thin body but crunchy crust. It was definitely really fresh because I burned the top of my mouth, but definitely my fault. Definitely going to try again on a weekday where it might not be as busy.",0
"I had such a great time at Portale! It's a really cozy and modern restaurant, perfect for a date. It's intimate without making you feel cramped, and the location is really interesting. The food was classic Italian food with a fancy twist, and it was all really good. I especially loved the fritto misto and the crudo di tonno. Both dishes were cooked exceptionally well and I thought the puffed fried crust on the fritto misto and the little mushrooms on the crudo added a nice touch. As for the entrees, we both ordered the cappellacci and the lumache, both of which were on the smaller portion end but cooked beautifully. Both dishes were very rich in flavor, so although you didn't get a lot, each bite was perfect. For dessert, we both ordered the tiramisu, and it definitely did not disappoint. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Portale and would highly recommend it.",1
"I absolutely love Lenwich's simple sandwiches and salads. The prices are really reasonable, and the food is always fresh and delicious. I never have to wait long for my food, and the staff is always polite and friendly. I highly recommend Lenwich to anyone looking for a good and affordable meal.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay. The pork buns were good, but the ramen wasn't my favorite. The Tokyo new style ramen was especially good. It was light and refreshing, and I enjoyed the truffle flavor. However, the small restaurant can be a bit of a challenge to get a table, so be prepared to wait.",1
"Ordered delivery directly from this restaurant. The order process was seamless and the food was delivered relatively quickly (30minutes). The food was warm when I got it. I ordered the pan fried udon, Shanghai noodles and Hunan smoked pork. The Hunan Smoked pork is highly recommended - the dish tastes amazing! It tastes somewhat similar to smoked bacon. I would order from this restaurant again.",0
"We stopped in at this restaurant because it was close by and we were looking for a place to eat. We were not overly impressed with the food - it was really basic and not that great. The red sauce was bland and the spicy fra diavlo wasn't very spicy at all. The chicken and eggplant parm were both pretty bland as well. The Cesear salad was decent, but the grilled calamari was a bit disappointing. The staff was friendly and attentive, but we didn't love the food.",1
"We came here on a Friday night for dinner. It was pretty packed so I was glad we had a reservation. The ambiance of the place is really cool. It made me feel like we were in an old Chinese drama.We got the peking duck, fried rice, and beans and eggplant. The peking duck tasted delicious and satisfied my duck craving. Fried rice was a classic. It's pretty hard to mess up fried rice. I really liked the beans and eggplant. The beans were crunchy and had good flavor.The downside was that it took a while for us to get our drinks, near the end of dinner, so we didn't end up finishing them. Service was also pretty slow but I get it since they were packed.",0
Last night 3/4 of the restaurant was booked for early moon cake festival. Each table had 10 people. Everyone ate family style. There was 11 plates ordered per table. Each plate got devoured in minutes. Taste I would give it 3.5/5. Customer service for this much people I would give 5/5. Overall great experience. I would recommend and come back with big group of people.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious, and the gluten free buns were perfect. I would definitely go back and recommend it to others.",1
"A great place for comfort food and brunch! The restaurant had a lot of tables available for outdoor dining, but make sure to make a reservation beforehand! The service was really great. It was incredibly hot the day I went and my waiter was super courteous and professional. He wore his mask and gloves the entire time and kept coming back to my table to refill my water. The meals all ranged between $15-$20, which is reasonable for brunch in Manhattan. However, what makes Jacob's Pickles worth it is the portion sizes here are huge! I ordered the Biscuit French Toast ($14) and The Croque Madame ($18) and both were was so delicious and fresh. I loved the texture of the Biscuit French Toast and chicken in the Croque Madame was so juicy and tender.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. The only downside is that it can get a bit noisy, but that's to be expected in a busy Chinatown restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a vegetarian or vegan-friendly Chinese/dim sum restaurant.",1
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I visited this restaurant for Restaurant Week, but I was definitely not happy with the experience. The atmosphere is really nice, but the food was mediocre at best. The salad was filled with tiny pieces of artichoke, and the salmon dish was unfortunately overcooked. The cucumber jalapeño sauce was really good, though. I was really disappointed that the German tourists sitting next to me didn't have the same menu options as me, especially since the prices were much higher than what I would have paid at a regular restaurant. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Mall food court food and priced accordingly. At least they're quick for your money and the food, while never going to win any awards, is just tasty enough that there won't be (much) complaining about what you get for lunch.Specifically, the lamb noodle soup is perfectly serviceable, and the drink selection is a step above generic. So enjoy it for what it is.",0
"In the city for a concert and craving Seafood, we settled on this restaurant in Grand Central Station. Our experience was mixed; our initial server was terse and dismissive, almost rude but at the end of the meal he must have gone off shift and we were assigned a charming and friendly replacement. The place itself is an interesting mix of Grand ceiling and lighting, in keeping with its location, and trashy grocery store salt and pepper containers and cheap tablecloths, cutlery and dish-ware. The inflated prices (at least $10 per plate more than each dish is worth, we paid less at Bobby Flay's gourmet restaurant for top of the line everything!) lead you to believe you're getting class, but there are contradictions everywhere. The food was 3 star worthy, the pasta was cooked ok but the pesto was low on flavor (definitely needed more garlic) but was very fishy flavored which was unpleasant; most of it remained on the plate at the end of the meal. The asparagus was crisp and tender and the seafood up to par. The highlight of the meal was the ""grilled"" - it was actually pan fried with butter so be aware if you have dietary restrictions - salmon. It was perfectly cooked, juicy on the inside and crisp on the inside! The accompanying vegetables were perfectly cooked and the flavors so good (after adding salt and pepper!!) that I forgot about the side of hollandaise sauce. For close to $100 with only soft drinks and no appetizers or desserts it was way overpriced, even for NY and I wouldn't return. With all the restaurants in the city we have too many choices for a mediocre experience!",0
"Great sports bar. Lots of TVs side by side throughout the bar so you can easily watch a couple games without even turning your head. Wide selection of whiskeys. Great selection of draft beers too with a mix of crafts, locals, and macros to suit everyone's preferences. They also have hard cider, hard seltzer, and wines on tap too! They've it a kitchen in the back serving up some bar food too. I didn't look over their menu, but they had my favorite bar food: mozzarella sticks.",0
"This place was a disappointment. After having this place on my list for months, I was excited to finally not have to wait an hour or more to try it, but it wasn't what I had hoped it to be.I ordered the toro ssam bap, cucumber kimchi and gochu ramen.The appetizers were actually both quite good. The toro ssam bap was very refreshing and light, and the cucumber was perfectly crunchy and seasoned. The gochu ramen was a let down though. The pork belly was overcooked and part of the meat was super tough and dry. The soup was also way too heavy and salty. I usually always finish my soup down to the last drop, but this time I couldn't even drink it after I had finished the noodles. I'm not sure how this place has a Michelin star because I've been to many other places that serve better ramen. Unfortunately, I won't be back.",0
Finally made it!!! Last weekend we finally decided to try for an early dinner in hopes it wouldn't be as long for a table- 45min later around 5:45-6pm we finally got a 2 top outside... it was pretty chilly but we made the best of it! We tried the rigatoni and large 1/2 Bianca (white) 1/2 tie-dye (vodka with pesto) pizza everything came out fresh but soon went cold. I did enjoy the pasta and it was perfect to share!! Pizza is very thin so a large was perfect - I liked it but I'm not sure if it's worth over an hour wait? Also they had a lot of tables empty inside which I found was weird since clearly people were waiting to eat for over an hour? They also have a funny system of taking your temperature even if you are eating outside at a table to go inside? They hand you a piece of paper that approves you to use the bathroom? Not sure what that was... anyways seems they do ALOT of take out maybe that's a better idea?,0
"I was surprised to find that this restaurant was surprisingly packed for a weekday afternoon, but I guess people love their fried rice and Chinese sausage! The service was great and the food was as grand as the atmosphere. I really enjoyed the fried rice and garlic pork, but the lunch special was especially filling. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a good and filling meal.",1
"Simone Tong's new restaurant, Covid, is a great addition to the Portland food scene. The menu is a little different from her other restaurants, but all of the dishes are delicious. The Scallion Puffs are an excellent start to the meal, and the Multi-Grain Porridge is a great dish to share. The Grass-Fed Skirt Steak and Poached Arctic Char are also great choices, and the Black Sesame Panna Cotta is a great dessert. I'm looking forward to coming back to experience a full meal here.",1
"Island Oyster is a great place to go for a drink and some oysters. The views are beautiful, and the drink, the ""Mariner,"" is refreshing. The downside is that you can't order food at the bar, you have to order it online. The food was good, though, and the lobster BLT was my favorite part of the meal.",1
"I absolutely love their braised short rib pho! It's one of the best things on the menu, and the spicy sauce on top really makes it stand out. The braised short rib bun is also really good, but I think the pho is definitely the star of the show. The only downside is that the fish tacos don't quite measure up to the rest of the food. They're not bad, but they just don't have the same flavor profile as the rest of the menu. All in all, I'd definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try if you're in the area!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious, and the portions were large. The only downside was that our server was a bit slow, but that's to be expected on a Saturday night. I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"Ate here tonight everything is dry from brisket to rotisserie chicken. It was 7pm on a Friday and prime dinner time yet it was like eating a paper towel. Wow, waste of my hard earned money and time, I wish they can do better!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was prompt and the food was delicious. The pancake dish I ordered was excellent, and the sausage was also very good. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I had a decent experience at Malai Marke, though the food was not as good as my two favorite restaurants in the area. The lunch special is a good deal at $12.95, and includes a generous portion of curry and rice. The only downside is that I was ignored when I walked in, which made the experience less enjoyable.",1
"The taste of the food is fine, but the portions are really small. I ordered the Spandex on UberEats, and if you look at the picture, you can see that the food barely filled up half the bowl. There was one egg, a few slices of avocado, some shredded carrots, and some quinoa. The quinoa was overly doused in oil and the whole thing was not filling enough, especially for the price.",1
"Decided I wanted to eat vegetables. Looked for said vegetables on the yelp and found this place. Welp rediscovered it actually because I remember coming to the cozy bar front during its genesis for a few cocktails that were actually quite good but now that it's been a solid while I couldn't tell you what they were. Good they were though.I digress. The food here is so delicious I'm confused about the lack of cream sauces. They use the spice of the Mediterranean to the max and it's delightful.Try the roasted cauliflower but be warned it can be extra toasty (charred even).The beet Manti was my favorite as it was colorful AND hearty. I also loved the muhammara probably because I love red peppers.Every plate is beautiful and Instagram pic worthy, no filter necessary.",0
Nice interior with outdoor seating.  Had nice prices fix lunch .  Nice place to go around 3 pm as it doesn't close between lunch and dinner.  Recommend the clams casino-tasty and nice size portion.  Sauce is good for dipping bread.  Highly recommend.,0
"I am now cuckoo for Koku. There's something about having a hot bowl of broth and al dente noodles on a cold winter day! I've ordered takeout and dined here with friends a couple of times and the experiences have been great. Their ramen broth is rich and flavorful, and that includes the Koku and shoyu ramens, both of which I have tried. I've also sampled the crispy pig ears, which were tasty, and hope to try out some more appetizers during future visits. Albeit small and usually packed, seats at the restaurant free up fairly quickly, so don't expect a long wait. Enjoy!",0
"This review is specifically for the midtown location because honestly I've only had mediocre food at the Mott street location.However, midtown is delicious. Five stars based on the quality of the food and the service, three stars for price (though the prices aren't atypical for the neighborhood).I've been here many times, and believe the two best things are the Peking duck and the steamed mixed vegetables (hot take, I know). The Peking duck is crispy and delicious, and I appreciate how the server makes the pancakes for you so you don't have to. The veggies are always delicious and balance out the richness of the duck nicely. I've also gotten the shrimp dumplings (yummy and traditional), the spare ribs (typical), the salt and pepper shrimp (watch out, shells are on), and the spicy eggplant (always good).The service is always top notch, so this is a nice place for family. Highly recommend a visit!",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The atmosphere is modern and clean, and the staff is friendly and efficient. My favorite dish was the spinach dumplings in hot & sour broth - it was a delicious and unique flavor combination. The dumplings were also very large and filling, which I appreciated. My date ordered the spicy lamb noodle soup and found it to be very spicy, with excellent noodles. The soup was also very tasty. Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the value for the price. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Love that these sushi sets are becoming a thing in NYC. Allows for people to try a variety of things at a reasonable price. Reservations are easy to be made at Sushinao on Opentable. The restaurant is very beautiful, giving off that traditional Japanese vibe. Service was also very nice and attentive.Pleasure set ($44) - For dinner, it was just the right amount of food for a sushi lover. The set included- bowl of salted edamame-salmon ceviche that tasted very fresh and light-unagi handroll-6 pieces of regular sushi, some lightly sauced-6 pieces of another set of sushi including scallops, unagi, sweet shrimp-lightly dressed crab handrollAll of it was super delicious and fresh tasting! For the price, thought it was great! Would def come again!",0
I had a great experience at Jue Lan club! The food was delicious and the service was friendly and quick. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
"Came here with a friend on a sunnier winter day. Although indoor dining is open, we opted to sit outside and enjoy the warm sun. Originally came here to try their chicken and French toast but their lunch box special was calling my name. I went with the butternut squash soup (delicious and perfect for a chilly day), the chicken Caesar salad and the Oreo icebox cake. Everything was very tasty and service was great! Covid precautions are taken very seriously and you are even able to pay on your phone which is awesome.",0
"A great option in the pandemic.  The open rooftop expanse to the bar is wonderful.  Great old fashions go well with burgers, Greek salads, Buffalo wings, spicy chicken sandwiches, and great deep rubbed ribs.  So glad to have this in the neighborhood!",0
Artichoke's is one of my favorite pizza places in town - their Sicilian slice is definitely my favorite! The crust is always crispy and the topping is always delicious. The only downside is that it's cash only.,1
"The atmosphere was cozy and the service was slow, but overall it was a nice place to sit outside, relax and have a drink. The tuna on crack was amazing! The only downside was that the service was slow, but the restroom was really cool.",1
"I had a great experience at Indikitch. The food was excellent, and the layout and concept were unique and well executed. I ordered a chicken tikka Kati rolls and a side order of samosas. The Kati rolls were great. The bread for the rolls was soft and fought but firm. The rolls held the meat and other topping together well. The chicken was cooked fresh. As such, the meat was tender and moist. The flavors in the rolls were delicious. I got it spicy. It had a strong kick but was not too spicy (i.e. not atomic level spicy). In regards to the samosa, they were solid. The shell was fried and crisp. The dominant taste of the filling was potatoes. They were good. The samosas are pre-made and sit on a heated counter. Accordingly, the temperate of them were lukewarm. They probably taste better fresh.

Overall, I had a great experience at Indikitch. The food was excellent, and the layout and concept were unique and well executed. The only downside is that the samosas are not as good as they could be, but they are still solid. I would recommend Indikitch to others.",1
I come here for their pizza special which is really good. I usually have their Buffalo chicken pizza and the mushroom slice. Both are very good; and this is my neighborhood pizza place. Their customer service could be better but their pizza is always very good. The Buffalo chicken pizza is always very flavorful and the thickness of the pizza is just right. The mushroom slice is also thin and tasty not too oily.,0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The large party of 12 of us were put in a hot sweat box without air conditioning and it was really uncomfortable. Our food was good, but the salmon bruschetta roll was not good at all. I also didn't enjoy the soy dusting on the dessert. Overall, the food was decent, but the conditions of the restaurant left a lot to be desired.",1
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent. The Outdoor Kakatsu was a neat experience, but it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be. The food was mild, but it was still edible. The service was good.",1
"The hipster, Californian tourist I am, or was when me and my group of friends ran, huddled together for warmth, into this cute little diner to keep out of the NYC wintertime cold, you know I ordered the AVOCADO TOAST. To my surprise, this turned out to be one hefty/hearty meal! And we were set to go eat KBBQ shortly after with some lawyer friends of our lawyer friend in Midtown, so I definitely left way too full on leaving.We were served our waters so quickly after we sat down, too. Like here, out-of-townees, hydrate!I loved the diner feel of not too sketchy, but not too boujee.Great little find to kill time before the uber arrived!",0
"I found Toro Loco on Tik Tok while looking for restaurants in the city that offer bottomless brunch. I made a reservation a week ahead and my party arrived as soon as the restaurant opened, so we were quickly seated upon arrival. I had a great experience, however, I am removing a star because we were seated directly in front of the front door AND air conditioner. I was FREEZING, so I asked the host if we could be seated elsewhere, but she told me that we couldn't be moved because the place was completely booked and they strategically planned seating by party size. She was able to get the air conditioner turned off for me, however, multiple tables in the back remained empty throughout our entire time in the restaurant, so that was slightly annoying.Nevertheless, my party still enjoyed our visit. For vegans, there's not much on the menu. They offer Beyond Al Pastor Tacos, and that's it. I asked the host if I could substitute the tacos for fries (to make loaded fries), and thankfully, the chef agreed. I'm very happy that they did because the food was SO GOOD. My vegan friend ordered the same thing and she said that it was one of the best meals that she had during our week-long trip. They should seriously consider adding it to the menu. 10/10As for the bottomless brunch, our server was truly ON TOP OF IT. Our cups were never empty, so shoutout to him. The drinks were great, and I love how they don't limit you to one type of drink like some restaurants do. You can choose between mimosas, a bloody mary/maria, margaritas, micheladas, and a truly, and you can alternate as you please. I hated that we were sat so far away from other tables because part of the joy of bottomless brunch is interacting with other drunk guests, but we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless.",0
"The French vegan restaurant was very small, and the service was excellent. I started off with a natural lemonade and French onion soup, and both looked amazing. However, the taste didn't quite match up. My friend had their steak frites, which is a mushroom base with truffle fries, and I went with a seitan dish. Both my entree and my friend's texture were delicious, but the price was a bit high. Overall, it was a very nice experience.",1
"Amazing Thai food spot in the upper east side. I went during COVID and was pretty happy with the overall experience. Tables were spaced apart, all the staff members wore masks, and we were required to fill out a contract tracing sheet as soon as we got our table.  We did family style and shared the tom yum soup, curry puffs, green curry with chicken, pad see ew with pork, and pad kra pow with chicken. Curry puffs and the soup were great apps to start with. The soup had the perfect kick to it. It does have a lot of mushrooms tho, so if you don't like mushrooms, I wouldn't order it. The entrees were very tasty. Pad see ew was a little sweet, but still good. Overall, I was very satisfied with the food and service and glad I checked it out.",0
"WOW the service here is what I call a nightmare.They are super slow and seem like they don't know the menu or anything so I was sort of surprised.We got seated and we literally had to stare for someone to acknowledge us and it really sucked.The woman next to us was with a friend she asked a bunch of different servers if the dish had dairy and THEY had to ask each other and the kitchen and it was embarrassing how does the staff not know the menu what if someone had a serious allergy.Had to constantly ask for more water, when we asked for to-go containers they basically took 10-15 minutes but they gave us the bill first which was sort of insulting we can't leave anyway.. The service was just wow I still can't imagine.The food was okay, nothing to write home about esp. with the service.",0
"Although I always love the pizza in the end, this place always struggles with service. This time they seated us upstairs in 'No Man's Land' and proceeded to forget about us for 20 mins. That is until my husband went downstairs and reminded them...we know because we heard him all the way upstairs! So...did we leave? No way, we got Rick Star seating and service by the owner. Was our food spit in? I can't imagine it was because he keeps a tight ship when he does reign it in, and we felt like he wanted us treated right after the bad start. So, the pizzas were amazing. My husband got the all meat pizza. My daughter and I had the 4-cheese and the truffle with something that didn't matter because the truffle made the pizza. Can we just get truffle pizza next time?? ;-DWe got excellent advice on what Italian wine to buy that translates to our French palate of Cabernet Sauvignon and then had 2! Overall, this place is across the street from my daughter & son-in-laws apartment and I LOVE the food and the convenience - and I can deal with a bit of service issue for it. I just can't give it a 5.",0
"Really good family meal tonight.After few months living in NYC , Oceana was the closest we ever gor in the city to an European meal.  Complimentary little pumpkin soup, proper vegetarian option (they actually present a special Menu for non meat eaters), good selection",0
"Two years ago when I came with a friend I must've found it okay, because I did not write a review; however, in the last two months I've come here at least six times due to MealPal, and not for the reasons you might think.I LOVE Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, so much so that I am fine with most places. During lunch, Galanga is the only Thai restaurant available on MealPal, which is why I go. Unfortunately, the Pad Thai is often a miss. Sometimes it's bland as heck (like today) so you can only rely on lime for flavor, or the vegetables are possibly spoiled and leave a weird sour taste in the food. The 3 star review is for the two-years-ago-visit, the fact that the Pad See Ew is usually good, and the employees at the front of the restaurant are quite nice. Tip: cash only",0
"Check out my in-depth review on Insta @dlireviews! :) You'll likely need a reservation here since it's rather a small interior but quite busy at peak hours. We stopped by for a dinner meal on a weekend and it was quite packed.I ordered the rigatoni & gamberi, which is spicy shrimp with pasta. I must first say the flavor was fantastic - the red sauce is rich but not overpoweringly sweet or salty like a lot of pasta dishes. Same goes for the cheese; complements the dish well but isn't too thick or heavy. The shrimp was listed as spicy but in all honesty didn't taste spicy at all, which wasn't a problem, but just something to note. My only bone to pick is portion size - it's not a ton of food for the price, and I still left a bit hungry, but I really did enjoy the flavor profile overall. Service was also very friendly. I did have to flag them down though to get my order in (we had sat waiting for a bit), but once we got our orders in the rest of service was great too. A great try, but perhaps on occasion.PROS:- friendly and welcoming service- rich flavor profile for pasta dishes; very fresh and flavorful - drink options available as wellCONS:- interior can feel a bit cramped - took a while to get our initial orders in- portion size could be larger",0
"Was excited to try out this spot, given all the hype surrounding it. We were here past midnight and it seemed like a drunk pizza place. We ordered two slices and they didn't taste fresh at all, plus the texture was dry l! The quality was similar to that of a typical street-side pizza shop in NYC. Pretty disappointed!",0
"Amazing evening with delicious food and super friendly attentive staff!  We ordered a bunch of small plates, octopus, scallops, calamari, croquettes - all so full of flavor! Then the entrees we ordered the special halibut, seafood paella for two and squid ink angel hair seafood for two as well! Perfect amount of food for six people! What an amazing find, I can't wait to be back again!",0
"I was really impressed with this restaurant! The service was fast, efficient, and reasonably priced. The menu looked great and the locals I spoke to said the food was great too. This is a great respite from the HOT summer streets of New York.",1
"I had a great experience at Viv Thai restaurant under new management. The decor has been revamped and it's much brighter and more inviting. The lunch special is now a great deal - appetizer, entree, and Thai iced tea or iced coffee for $11.95. I ordered the chicken gyoza appetizer, Pad Kee Mao (drunken Thai noodles) entree with chicken, and a Thai iced tea. The portions were decent and the food was tasty. I miss Talent Thai since their Thai iced tea was not too sweet, but Viv Thai did a good job in replicating that flavor. The service was fast and attentive. I would definitely come back to try their other lunch specials.",1
"Zauo is a fun, unique dining experience that's definitely worth checking out if you're in the city! The clean decor, warm lighting, and mesmerizing vertical LCD screen display are a great start, and the fish and lobster dishes are absolutely delicious. The downside is that the prices are a bit high, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're looking for something different.",1
Came here for the beautiful presented hot pot.Overall was okay but felt like missing a flavor in the soup. (Or maybe just I like heavier taste)Still great for winter time though.,0
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was really cozy and the food was amazing. I especially loved the pasta dish I ordered - it was definitely one of the best things I've ever had. The truffles added a really delicious flavor to the dish, and I could tell they were really well done. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"Visited The Ainsworth - Midtown with my friend for the unlimited mimosas and some good brunch food. This was my first time visiting this location and wow it is a really big restaurant located in a hotel. It looks very refined and classy but not too fancy. FYI you need to exit the restaurant to use the bathroom in the hotel but itIs connected. We made reservations and called because we were running late but it was no issue. There was barely anyone when we came at 12:30pm on a Sunday. We were seated quick and our waitress was really nice and attentive. All of the staff was kind and helpful. We started with our mimosas, pineapple and mango flavors. They were delicious and we felt pretty good after 2 hours of continuous glasses. For our meals I had the traditional waffle and a side of scrambled eggs. I would give it a 6/10. The waffle was not the best. The flavor was kind of there but it lacked more of a sweeter taste I expect waffles to have. The eggs were good. My friend wasn't too crazy about her mac n cheese either due to the flavor but it did fill her up. My friend had vouchers from an app for the restaurant that included meals under $29 and unlimited mimosas. Most of the entrees were already under $29 though so our bill wasn't too crazy. I may come back for a lunch/dinner. I definitely want to try the popular 24k gold wings!",0
"Wow I was definitely pleasantly surprised by this small Italian spot in West Village! I loved their take on some of the dishes, and everything was very flavorful and unique. Highlight for me was def the oysters and gnocchi. Overall their seafood is very fresh. We started off with roasted oysters, and the crab fat butter it was baked in just made it all the more rich and flavorful. I haven't really had crab fat mixed with butter so thought the concept was pretty unique! The scialatelli was made with sour butter which helped with the richness of the cream sauce. The gnocchi came with soft shell crab and fava beans which seems like a strange pairing but was actually amazingly good. Finally the scallops had some golden raisins and pine nuts that created a good balance of flavors.Overall highly recommend and will def be back to try more! It was fairly packed on a Saturday night though so make res beforehand.",0
"Had takeout from here. We ordered a few sushi and sashimi combos, a crispy rice roll, and a dragon roll. Everything tasted excellent. Picking up the food was very efficient. After the placing the order it was ready about 25 minutes later. This was around 7 pm on a Saturday night. I also appreciated that they called to verify the location where I placed the order. That was nice of them. Overall everything was good. I'd like to go back and eat at the restaurant as it looks like a fun spot.",0
"If I could give them 10 stars I would!! My friends just hosted a private birthday party there this weekend and we had the best time. It is so cute inside. Open bar and unlimited finger foods for under $100 pp is a steal for nyc! Food included French fries, sweet potato fries, chicken fingers (sooooo good), BEC, cheeseburger sliders, tuna melts. Drinks were nonstop but the best part was absolutely the service. They came by constantly to refill our food and drinks without us needing to ask. If we needed straws or to throw something out someone was right there helping immediately! Will definitely come back!",1
"Service was nice, price was reasonable and food was delicious.Bread was not fresh nor warm.4*Polipo E Patate was seared octopus, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley, scallions, garlic vinaigrette: octopus was moist, fresh, and tender. Portion was rather small but a delicious dish.4*Raviolone Occhio di Bue was one big ravioli with ricotta ,egg yolk and bacon in a butter and sage sauce. It was a creative dish; portion was very small. 4*Pinino Con Porchetta: it was Ciabatta bread with slow roasted suckling pig and onion marmalade: Bread & pork were warm & crispy, vegetables were clean and fresh. Fattening dish but delicious.4*Svizzerina do ManzoIt was a Northern Italian chopped beef burger with lettuce, tomato, and pickles; served with potatoes. We ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. A burger that tasted the way burgers should ALWAYS taste.",0
"I really enjoyed my lunch at this restaurant! The pizza was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that it was a bit noisy, but that didn't really bother me. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Great brunch menu. $25 get you a brunch entree (ratchet on smaller side though) with three drinks (bloody Mary, mimosa, Bellini or beer). Their Cobb salad (not in brunch special) is really good and worth getting outside of the special (particularly if like me you are not drinking anyways lol).",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty bad here. The temperature was fine, but everything lacked flavor and the egg rolls were absolutely terrible. I definitely won't be ordering from here again.",1
"The restaurant was pretty crowded when I visited on a Monday evening, so I recommend making a reservation if you're looking to come here. The Perilla Seed Tofu Stew ($19) was pretty bland, but I appreciated the addition of the complimentary tofu starter and banchan. I'm interested in trying more of the other menu items and the cold bean noodles for the summer, so I'm definitely coming back.",1
"Westville is a great place for casual brunch. The prices are a bit high, but they're not too far off from what you would pay in New York City. My Mediterranean Breakfast Platter was delicious, and the bathroom is through the hotel lobby, which is a nice convenience.",1
Icy cold noodles are served here year round and delicious. It's our go-to place for cold noodles. The noodles are well-cooked and have a great flavor. I highly recommend this restaurant!,1
"Ordered the meat sauce noodle soup, and the dish was on the verge of inedible. The bowl was essentially a puddle of chili oil & tomatos ""soup"" that had no flavor. The noodles (even after soaking for 5-10 minutes) refused to separate from each other - I actually had to put down my chopsticks and cut chunks of stuck noodles with a knife and fork. Some chunks of the meat sauce was pure pork fat, which made it looks like the meat used was just the remaining discards of some other dishes.",0
"This restaurant had a great atmosphere and was very accommodating. The games playing on the tv were a nice touch. The food was good and reasonably priced. Overall, a great spot for a casual night out.",1
"I had a wonderful dinner at Sen Sakana in Time Square. The restaurant is conveniently located close to many broadway shows, and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the spicy tuna and Yusuf scallop in crispy spring roll, and the classic ceviche was also very interesting. However, the prices were a bit high, e.g. $18 cocktails and $25 cold appetizers. Overall, I highly recommend Sen Sakana for a delicious and interesting dinner.",1
"I had a great time visiting this hidden gem around 3:40 on a Friday afternoon. The place was bustling with to-go orders and the staff was busy wrapping up lunches in the back, so it took a while to order. But the food, which arrived in 5 minutes, was definitely worth the wait! I ordered chicken pad Thai, and it was delicious -- the thin noodles were cooked perfectly and there was a lot of flavor. I especially loved the peanuts, which added a nice crunch. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good Thai meal.",1
"I was honestly skeptical at first, for how gimmicky this sounded, but absolutely enjoyed the ranch chicken and waffle cone I ended up getting. The waffle cone was actually very good itself, which I believe helped tie the whole thing together because that was the area I was most concerned about. The ranch and chicken were also great and definitely left me wanting more. They had a few flavors to choose from too, ranging in hotness, so everyone should be able to get a flavor they like and they also have Cajun fries, which looked pretty good too. My only complaint is that it is a little bit of a small portion for the overall price you could pay for the chicken and cone, fries, and drink, but it's New York, so you're never going to find a bargain. Overall, solid place and would absolutely recommend.",1
"Wonderful classy Italian restaurant great for dinner with friends, family or a date.Service.  Bartender, hostess and servers were extremely friendly and attentive from the time we arrived to the time we left. Ambiance. White linen tablecloths, black chair covers and small fresh flowers on the tables contributed to a comfortably formal and classy atmosphere.  The table where we were seated couldn't have been more perfect, set apart from the rest, private feeling, and overlooking the tables on the first level of the dining room. Food.  We had dinner here restaurant week, and everything was great.  - bread with oil- mussels in a light broth - fantastic - burrata- very good - veal- tender, excellent - seafood with green and white pasta- the pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was delicious. - tiramisu- - chocolate cake- deliciousDefinitely recommend for a great italian dining experience with outstanding service.",0
"The food at Dallas BBQs used to be amazing, but it sadly hasn't been the case in a while. I ordered the sticky wings and was extremely disappointed when I found out that they had missed a lot of feathers. I couldn't even enjoy them at all; had to remove 70% of the skin to get to the meat. The shrimp and cornbread were both overcooked, and the pina colada was quite mediocre. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1
"I was really disappointed with this hotpot restaurant. The broths are good, but not worth coming back for. The menu is pretty limited, with their selection being mostly Similar items that are just a little bit different. The beef was fresh and had a good fat to lean ratio, but the lamb was super tough and hard to chew through. I would be willing to give this place another try, but probably not anytime soon.",1
"Yo, Gnocco is the bomb.com! Location is a hike from any subway, but it is WORTH the walk. This joint has it all from excellent wine, fire pasta dishes, and pizza that will blow your mind. Service was also great for our group of 8 on a Friday night no less! Very quick for the bottle of wine I snagged, and the dishes were no later than 10-15 minutes later. Wine: -Red Bled, see picture. Very light and went great with our dishes. Food: -Gnocchi. It. Was. Fresher than any outfit you'll see on the LES. -can't recall the name of the pizza, but I was plain cheese with spicy salami and pepperoni! So light and so fresh. Perfectly cooked. If you don't go here and give this joint a try, you're whack.",0
"Surprisingly Bluebird has good Restaurant Week offerings. The Jersey leek appetizer with crispy artichoke was the perfect starter to my excellent shrimp and snapper entree. It was actually really good. I had the lobster bisque sauce on the side and I didn't really need it since the shrimp and fish were flavorful enough. The pork schnitzel had a familiar New York note to it, like I had it at a good diner somewhere. The banoffee, a chocolate mousse and banana dessert was light and not overly sweet. The only blip in our experience (and I normally don't put too much weight on this part unless there was something very noticeable) was the service. Our server lacked a little attention. He forgot my bf's drink and kept saying ""green tea"" when I said I wanted Earl Grey. I repeated it several times to be sure he got it. The food made up for it and the server was adequately apologetic for his oversight.",1
"Flex Mussels reopened and we're so happy! The new menu is great with lots of delicious options, like the roasted oysters and smoked trout fish dip. The seafood bouillabaisse was also delicious. We highly recommend trying out this restaurant!",1
"This place is pretty cute, but the food didn't quite live up to my standards. The service was great, though.",1
"I'm not the only one that thinks Los Tacos No. 1 has the best tacos in NYC. I had heard Los Mariscos was owned by the same people, but they offer seafood-based tacos. This place doesn't disappoint! We got the fish & enchilado tacos + the ceviche especial. The tacos were topped with the perfect amount of sauce and the seafood was extremely well cooked! I would definitely come back for the tacos, but wasn't a huge fan of the ceviche. We also got the margarita. You can either get Mezcal or Tequila-- we got Mezcal and it was insanely strong. As someone who enjoys cocktails, this drink was way too alcoholic for my taste. However, you're certainly getting the most bang for your buck!",0
"We went here last night for dinner with some friends that are like family. They're all Italians, except Lorenzo and I and they told us it's the best Italian food in NYC. I would disagree I think it's the best Italian food in America! Some of the best ravioli I've ever had, their truffle sauce is what dreams are made of! To top it off the service was even better. The waiter is friendly and knowledgeable, the chef comes by to make sure we liked our food. It was just a fantastic experience all the way around. It was one of those meals that made you realize just how good a dining experience can be and should be.Oh and the dessert! Wow! It's so incredible! We ordered the dessert sampler and it fed 7 people and  we had some we had left because we couldn't finish it. The cheesecake melts in your mouth. Also the wine selection is wonderful and the waiters make sure your glass is never empty. This place is magical, the decor is spectacular and the way you're treated is like you're royalty. If you're in NYC this place is a MUST!",0
"I had a great experience at Friedmans! The Nova Benny was amazing, and the service was great. The only downside was that the portion size was a bit small for the price. Overall, I highly recommend Friedmans!",1
"Yay for happy hour specials that's currently available every night from open to close! $1.50 oyster of the day with all others ranging from $2.25 to $2.75 each and $6/$7 tapas, wine and sake.Oysters were fresh and moderate sized (not big but not tiny). We loved the wasabi lime sorbet and mignonette sauces.Handrolls are $6 each or 4 for $22. Definitely try the unagi - it was warm, had a nice smokey flavor from being torched, and the chocolate sauce was the cherry on top even though you could barely taste any chocolate. The spicy yellowtail was okay but negi toro and spicy tuna were both very lackluster. I'd probably skip out on them.Korean fried chicken was tasty and had a good crunch from the tempura like coating but I do wish the chicken was hotter. It took a while for this small dish to come out so we thought the kitchen may have needed more time to make it but it was lukewarm so that makes me wonder if it had just been sitting around in the kitchen?Overall, a lovely date night spot with dim candle lit lighting but not overly dark that you can't see your partner or the food. There's soft jazz music playing in the background which really sets the mood. Seating is a little tight along the bar but chairs were super comfortable. Service was wonderful but got a little slow once the place was filled. You probably won't get too full here but it's a good place to go for a pre-dinner snack.",0
"This restaurant is unfortunately closed down, and there is no information on their website or anywhere on this website that says this. However, if you're looking for a delicious Thai meal in the area, I recommend checking out Golden Lotus. They're definitely worth a visit!",1
"Han Dynasty is a good place for food. The portions are very generous, and the food is always cooked well. The only downside is that it can get pretty busy, especially in the cold weather. But it's definitely worth the wait. My favorites are the dan dan noodles, mapo tofu, and the fish dishes. The food also tastes good the next day, so you can definitely make a meal of it.",1
"Cheap take-out. Nothing to write home about but it'll fill your stomach and keep you from going hangry. $7-8 lunch specials that come w a pint of rice, a cup of their daily soup, and an item of your choosing off their pretty extensive menu. Got the fried fish filet with braised tofu and bitter melon with chicken lunch specials. Decent for the price. I also like buying quarts for their daily soup for $3- pretty good price considering the alternative which is to spend hours watching my stove. They've also made a lot of changes after covid- initially they tried to charge an extra $2 for all roasted meats and raised prices for everything but then when folks stopped going they lowered prices again and started doing lots of deals that go all day long if you know how to order in Chinese. Roast pork/ crispy pork is now $10/lb, one of the cheapest in chinatown. Half a chicken/ duck is $12. Proof of vaccination required for dine-in. Strictly enforced. Saw them turn away a family of 6 that included elderly and kids because they claimed they left their vax cards at home.",0
"I recently visited Ricotta Dumplings, and they were really good! The dumplings were layered with thinly sliced mushrooms and a sauce. The tartare was pretty solid, and the squid ink rice was nice and crispy. I could have skipped the endive dish and the pork, but they were both okay. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Ricotta Dumplings!",1
"Hudson Clearwater is a restaurant that I would recommend to others during the pandemic. The service was slow, but the food was good. My favorite dish was the cinnamon roll, which was hot and fresh. The hollandaise sauce was not good, however.",1
"So, post covid reopening, it was empty and also perhaps, I was bit early for dinner time.  Anyhow. Had my little cote de Rhone and salmon.  It blew off my pants.  And also, it is a good sign to sit by French person having dinner next to me.  I also loved little Porto that came with the check after dinner.   All was amazing!! Surely to be back again.",0
"Hill Country was a fun, large establishment filled with lots of delicious barbecue and sides. I came with a friend around 7 PM on a Friday night and the place was packed. It was very boisterous and loud. For food ordering, you are given a little card by your server and you line up and can order the meat and the sides by the pound which they put on a tray along with a couple slices of bread. We ordered some moist brisket, spare ribs and turkey for our protein portion of the meal. I am normally not a big fan of turkey but this turkey was not too bad. The spare ribs and briskets were delicious though! As for our sides we got the cole slaw, mashed sweet potatoes and macaroni and cheese. The Mac and cheese was absolutely delicious. Mashed sweet potatoes was surprisingly good as well. However, the cole slaw was disappointing. The cabbage was cut too large and did not soak up enough of the dressing so it was still bitter and hard which is not the flavor and texture I like for my cole slaw. Additionally, service was average. At times it was difficult to grab the servers attention which made sense since they were swamped. All in all, a fun restaurant to hit that bbq craving!",0
I had a great time at Calle Dao! The atmosphere is really cozy and the service was amazing. Our food was also really great - the black rice seafood paella was delicious and the chicken with yellow rice was also really good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!,1
"I had a lovely experience at this restaurant. The eggplant and basil stir fry was delicious and I especially enjoyed the mock duck. The tables are quite close together, but that's Manhattan for you! The restaurant is very pretty, and I would definitely recommend it.",1
I always enjoy ordering from Pio Pio because I really enjoy eating Peruvian food. I have never dined-in so I am glad I was able to do that. Parking is difficult to find so allow yourself time for that. There is no outdoor seating area but the decor inside is pretty basic and clean. The restaurant is very spacious as well. The wait staff was professional and took our order in a timely matter. I think I will definitely come back again because I had a great time here.,1
"I stopped by this restaurant on a food tour and thought the pizza was mediocre. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The pizza slice itself was fresh (made to order), but I found it to be a little greasy and oily. I would recommend checking out some of the other amazing options in the area before coming here.",1
"I waited 6 years to dine here, and it was worth the wait! The service is friendly, very laid back and chill, and there are no snoots here greeting you, which was a nice change for a great restaurant.

Their burger was delicious. Juicy and full of flavor, served with a spicy sauce. The roll/bun could have used some actual flavor, but overall the meal was delicious.

One pasta dish we found to be much too rich and salty. It was not bad, but it just didn't taste like freshly made pasta (as I was hoping), or a sauce where you could taste quality ingredients.

I just noticed cream and salt in the dish. The other pasta dish with the mushroom ragu- the pasta was completely under cooked. Not at all al dente. More like could have used 8 more minutes on the stove. We probably should have sent it back but didn't- we were having a great time.

The mushroom ragu itself was okay, just a bit too rich tasting. Even though 2 of the dishes were a let down, I liked the place and would give it another try for different dishes, I think.",1
"I love this place. The staff is extremely friendly and they have some of the best gelato I've ever had. The flavors are so rich and delicious, the flavors really come through and stand out on their own. Their signature rose design on a cone is a nice touch and it's great that you can get as many flavors as you'd like. They've suspended samples due to Covid, but honestly, all of the flavors are delicious. Passion fruit is one of my absolute favorites, It tastes like you're vacationing on a tropical island! They have outdoor seating where you can enjoy your gelato right now.",0
"This place was truly a disappointment. The food is bland and so is the service. Within minutes after we placed our order, the appetizers arrived. I started my meal with the tofu vegetable soup which tasted like hot tap water with a pinch of salt. While there were plenty of veggies, they were tasteless and the tofu was entirely too soft. My friend had the scallion pancakes which he seemed to enjoy. While my appetizer was a fail, I remained optimistic about the rest of my meal. We ordered the shrimp with asparagus and the Shanghai bok-choy with shiitake mushrooms and bean curds. Can you say hospital food! One would have thought we were on a restricted diet in a hospital. No salt, no pepper, no flavor, just cardboard flavored watery vegetables and 4 shrimps. That didn't stop us. I guess we are indeed glutens for punishment-- we dared to order dessert. Fried green tea ice cream and matcha tiramisu. The fried ice cream was ok. The tiramisu was equivalent to a dish sponge! The decor is not much to speak on so I won't.",1
"The food was good, but the service was really poor. We were seated quickly, but all downhill from there. The server never asked if we had questions or even if we wanted anything to drink. At first, it comes off as they aren't pushy and trying to up sell, but just wait. The food came out quickly but no one came back around to check or refill drinks. We had to flag down someone so I could get a refill to wash down the rest of my meal. Overall, it's worth looking elsewhere for a better dining experience.",1
"I had a really great time at this Italian restaurant! The service was great and the food was really good. I especially loved the pear salad and pesto gnocchi. The pear was so sweet and flavorful, and the gnocchi had a delicious aftertaste. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a good Italian meal.",1
"There was no wait on a Friday night, which is pretty surprising. To enter, go up the elevator as directed. You order by the meat plate and we ended up spending about 50$ per person for a very filling meal for 5 people. The service is great - they come over to cook the meat perfectly on time and constantly make sure that the table is being cleared. Note that the check is electronic, so you can pay by Apple pay if you want. Marinated Kalbi ($11) Pork Belly ($33) x2Beef Thin Skirt ($39)Meats are all of good quality. The thin skirt was my favorite. Korean Style Seafood Pancake ($14) - This did not have much seafood in it so I didn't even realize it was the seafood pancake at first. Also super thin.Assorted Sausage Stew ($23) - Definitely skip this - it's pretty similar to the Army stew and is just a bunch of ingredients thrown together.The meat also comes with a steamed egg and a few side dishes. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have whole lettuce leaves or radish.",0
"Fantastic brunch food to feed your gluttonous soul. Southern classics served in huge portions justifying their $17-25 price tag for majority of their entrees. Their fried chicken, biscuits, and spicy pickles made me so bloated because I simply could not stop eating. Perfectly breaded and fried, the chicken cutlets were probably the size of my face. I also ordered the corn soup special, and it was creamy, well balanced and a great, under the weather, bone warming soup. I could drink it at home under blankets, if I could. Entrees could easily be split between 2-3 people per entree with some appetizers. The french fries were done well and perfectly crispy. I definitely recommend getting the honey chicken sandwich that comes with cheese grits so you can get a taste of popular food items that Jacob's pickles has to offer - spicy pickles, biscuits, honey fried chicken, and a side of cheese grits. YUMMY.",0
"I came here for my anniversary with my husband. It was actually really nice! I ordered the Lobster Po Boy which came with delicious fries and salad. The po boy was pretty good too. It was kind of small for the price but it was very tasty! My husband ordered the original burger which he said was the best burger he has ever had and he had has a TON of burgers in his lifetime! I did make a reservation which I suggest. It was empty when we arrived at 5pm but by the time we left... it was PACKED so I definitely recommend a reservation. The service was good. She was friendly and attentive. Also, I don't know if the pickles are made inhouse but they were very different than any other pickles I've ever had before. They were super fresh and not overly dill, almost like a cucumber salad... hard to explain, but very good!",0
"Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. The food was good and the prices were fair. However, the service was a bit off. I would recommend trying it out for yourself and seeing if you have a better experience.",1
Delicious! I got the 109 and the sauce was amazing--it tasted a bit like marinara sauce. It also comes with soup. Apparently the authentic way of eating it is by putting a few scoops of soup into the dry noodles. Would highly recommend. A group of 20+ came here for dinner around 8:30 pm and did not have to wait. The servers were all super accommodating. Would come back again for 109!,0
"Windmill is a stylish little LES bar from established bartender Sother Teague (Amor y Amargo) and the folks behind Le French Diner, an intimate restaurant nearby.The menu is French and Japanese inspired small plates with no pretension. We had some tasty chawanmushi and a couple of skewers (heart and breast). I also had a brandy-based drink that was pretty good. Drink prices are on the lower side for the area ($13), but food can add up. I'd use this for a snack rather than a dinner.Service was good. Vibe was nice-- it filled up nicely on the early side of Friday night without getting too crowded. When I came, they were cash only but you could also Venmo.",0
"I had decided to give Patrick's a try one afternoon and was very happy with my choice. I walked in and was seated immediately to one of the high top tables facing the street. it is a large venue with seating at the bar as well as multiple options for table seating. There are multiple food options-salad, burgers, a raw bar, etc. I waited a while until the server arrived but had already made my choices. i decided on a cheeseburger, medium well which arrived with lettuce, tomato and onion and was delicious! I also ordered a small side salad but which arrived in a bowl that was too small to accommodate the salad, making it difficult to eat. A bigger bowl would be more appropriate. The server, Milot was attentive and had stopped by to see if I needed anything from time to time. Some may feel it is a little pricey but it is not for midtown.  it was an excellent meal and i would recommend and return",0
"Indian Accent is a great place to go for a nice meal - the aesthetic is amazing, and the food is generally quite good. However, the price is a bit high, and the servings are a bit small. I would recommend this restaurant to someone looking for a high-quality dining experience, but not someone looking for a lot of food.",1
I love that Operation Falafel lets you pick TWO pita sandwiches with different fillings - I got to try one with chicken and one with falafel. Both were delicious - the falafel is really flavorful. The hummus spread on warm pita bread is also amazing!,0
"I had been wanting to come here for brunch for the longest time and finally had a chance to do so about a month ago. The place is essentially a bar with tables in the back area. It was dark, loud and bustling. I waited at the bar because they do not seat incomplete parties. As soon as my friend arrived, we were given a table. I was disappointed because the Steak and Eggs were no longer part of the brunch offerings even though it was listed online. For this reason, it took me even longer than usual to decide what to order. I narrowed it down to the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and the falafel burger with waffle fries. Our waitress, who was also the hostess, really knew the menu well and described both food items in detail. After I let her know I was leaning toward something lunch-y, she suggested getting the falafel burger with pita instead of bread so that it wouldn't be as heavy. I decided to follow her advice. The falafel was a nice, hearty size and between warm pita bread, served with tomato, purple onion and lettuce, along with a pickle on top. The falafel was quite thick with a satisfying crispness and packed with delicious seasoning. It worked well with the tasty pita and the fresh vegetables added a lightness to the sandwich which was helpful because the falafel was a bit overpowering. I enjoyed the waffle fries which were slightly seasoned and were delightfully crunchy. Service was just okay. The place was pretty busy and the hostess / waitress also turned into a bartender as time went on. There were several times when it took awhile for our waitress to attend to us. I definitely would not return.",0
"I was unfortunately not impressed by my visit to this restaurant. The atmosphere was cozy and warm, but the food didn't really do it for me. The veggie tangine and chicken tangine were both quite bland, and I didn't enjoy anything that I ordered on my own. The free bread basket was actually my favorite part of the meal.",1
"First time coming to this place with my friend. We ordered at the kiosks but were greeted with friendly staff. The sandwiches and drinks were served within five minutes of placing our order.For drinks we got a strawberry lychee green tea and a taro milk tea. My friend enjoyed her green tea as it had a slightly bitter taste at the end to compliment the sweetness. I liked the taro milk tea as it wasn't too creamy that can often become over bearing.Our banh mi's of choice were the beef bulgogi and the caramelized pork with deli ham. The beef bulgogi was moist and tender complimented by the crispy and tart pickled carrots and daikon. The caramelized pork and Vietnamese ham was very tasty and exactly what I wanted. Our only complaint would be to add an additional cucumber slice for extra crispness. Definitely a modernized banh mi so don't expect a traditional flakey bread.There were a couple of tables outside where we were able to sit down and eat. Overall, we had a good experience and will come back next time we're in the area.",0
Got takeout last night (they did have heat lamps set up on the sidewalk and in a partially enclosed space in the street). I heard they were doing a special Chanukkah Bao and wanted to check it out. The Latke Bao was really tasty: a good mix of flavours and this non-Vegan couldn't even tell the sour cream didn't have dairy! We ordered the pork curry (my friend said that was good) and I had the crab sando. Both were delicious. I would definitely check it out again for their happy hour in warmer weather.,0
"Pretty decent Irish pub. Family and I had a really long day sightseeing and just got off the miss Ellis Island ferry. We were haaaangry and stumbled upon this place. Thank goodness for Irish pubs.  Dark but pleasant atmosphere. Good variety menu and they even made my aunt a frozen margarita. I ordered a veggie burger which was sort of weird with small pieces of vegetarian ""meat"" but the brioche bun was warm and toasted, skinny fries were mealy and hot. Also ordered soft pretzels (baked) but the ends were hard (maybe overbaked). They were large bread sticks and they had cheese dip sauce. Ok I'll forgive the hard ends because I have had a hankering for cheese sauce and it was darn good. I don't care if it was even velveeta or whatever they used, that's exactly what I wanted. Service was very good and we were all happy, so this place is a win for us!",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The drinks were delicious, and the food was also really good. I especially enjoyed the El Guapo, which was a spicy margarita that was perfect for my taste. The sliders were also very good, and I especially enjoyed the crab cake slider. The Mac n cheese was also very cheesy and very good, and I would definitely recommend it. The only downside was that the califlower appetizer was a bit fried and oily for my taste, but my friend loved it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others, and I'm looking forward to returning soon!",1
"I was really excited to try out the ice cream here, but unfortunately the coffee flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. The pistachio and dulce de leche flavors were both pretty mediocre as well. Overall, I wasn't impressed. The cones themselves are really cute though!",1
"I stopped by looking for congee during lunch time and the place seemed like a regular Chinese restaurant with all the usual Chinese dishes and bbq meats. The congee was hot and thick with plenty of topics added. However, the meat had a weird smell and it didn't taste bad though. I just hope it wasn't too old. I may come back to try the wonton noodles and beef chow fun noodle.",1
"Service well, the first time my sweet potato fries  were cold. Had to change them. The second time while enjoying my fries i find what looks like beard hair.Ew I had the guac burger was decent tasted like a taco And the seasonal lemonade which was matcha YUCK it was not good.",0
"I visited this place for a quick and easy meal and I was not disappointed. The prices are ridiculously cheap, and the food is simple and straightforward Chinese-American fast food. There's a fair variety of dumplings and more Sichuan style spicy/mala dishes, but I went basic and got General Tso's. I also got a shrimp stir fry which was kinda stingy on the shrimp, but my expectations were low. The General Tso's is pretty good though. Generous portions, brown sauce fried rice with egg, and a good amount of fresh broccoli. You sure get a calorie bang for your buck here.",1
"Although I was overall disappointed with my experience at Taqueria Meza, I must commend the staff for their friendliness and attentiveness. The food did not meet my expectations, however, and I was left hungry after waiting 30 minutes for my order. The food that did arrive was unfortunately cold, overcooked or runny, which was unfortunate given that my friends and I were really looking forward to trying it.",1
"Got takeout for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. I ordered the beef chimichangas. The pickup and ordering process was pretty smooth. I thought the price was a little steep for my dish, but in the end it was worth it because my chimichanga was stuffed with shredded meat. The dish was very well seasoned and I loved the side of guacamole and salsa that came with it. The tortilla was fried to a crisp perfection and paired really well with the soft interior. I saw that there was some pretty cute outdoor seating available.",0
"I had a good time at Caviar. The food was delicious, and the service was great. I especially loved the murgh tikka masala, and the chili topped naan. I think the chicken could have been a bit more tender, but overall I had a great time.",1
"I live right around the corner, and finally went here for a weeknight dinner. We used the Resy waitlist and it was super quick!! The host was super friendly and efficient. The diavola pizza was fantastic. The spicy salame was delicious. The pizza was good for sharing, big with 6 slices. Spaghetti limone, which they are known for, got more tasty as you let the cheese soak in. Don't think I would order again... would probably opt for a gnocchi I saw go by our table  will go back here soon!!",0
"Cute French bakery close to nearby hospital. Excellent place to grab something. The paninis are delicious- the fajita panini is a personal favorite. The salads are super fresh- I've only had the create your own salads! The cookies are DELICIOUS! So soft, so good. It's a small place but it works! Service can be quicker especially if you're in a rush/time schedule.",0
"I had a craving for pho a few days ago and ordered a beef pho and spring rolls for take out.The pho was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but the broth was flavorful and well-balanced. The price and portion is reasonable for the area, but if you're a big eater or out-of-towner like me, it might fall a bit short. I ordered extra noodles with my pho which was just right for me.The spring rolls were my favorite. Super crispy exterior with a tasty filling.Overall, it was a good experience and would recommend.",0
"I heard a rumor that Gossip Girl was filmed here- I haven't been able to confirm that but it was enough to tempt me to come here! My friend and I came here after watching a Broadway show since it was close by. I made a reservation for 10pm on a Friday, but we were running late so I called ahead and the hostess was very accommodating about it! When we arrived, the restaurant was on the emptier side. We were seated right when we arrived and started with a gin and tonic each. Their gin and tonics are served in giant fishbowls glasses- definitely worth your money! Our waiter was very helpful and recommended different flavors to us as well. We also got the truffle fries which were 5/5 stars! The aioli it came with was really well seasoned. $14 seems like a lot for fries but the serving was quite big. We stayed until around midnight and we basically watched the bar get busy over that time. When we arrived it definitely felt more ambient and romantic, but by the time we left it was full of people standing around the bar. I'd recommend this place as a date spot but come before 11pmish!",0
I absolutely love Poke! I miss them so much! I hope they start offering delivery and takeout again soon. Can't wait to support my favorite sushi spot.,1
"We decided to try this restaurant for delivery and were not disappointed. The dan dan noodles were flavorful and the pork pan fried dumplings were delicious. The general tso's chicken was also very good, with a good mix of flavors. The only downside was that the dan dan noodles had a bit too much vinegar, but overall we were very pleased with our meal. We will definitely be returning.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The service was always attentive and polite, and the food was delicious. The cocktails are definitely on the pricey side, but I didn't feel like they were too strong. The portions were also relatively small, but I still thought they were worth it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot!",1
"It's about the people, people first then food.This review unfortunately isn't about food, and the cold brew was ok. But this is a review about humans as I was greeted by Aaron (see selfie) and he made my whole experience. We're staying the the Soho Grand Hotel and I needed to press some buttons on my black mirror (laptop and work). Aaron greeted me with a smile, silly banter and a genuine awesomeness.",0
"I stopped by Hummus Kitchen for lunch today and it was a really cute, cozy spot. The open windows and small outdoor seating area is a nice touch. The only downside was the mediocre meat quality, which I found to be a little steep. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"My husband and I ordered takeout from Sichuan Hot Pot Cuisine, so take this review with a grain of salt. Unfortunately the staff got our order wrong and gave us the smashed cucumber instead of the black fungus appetizer, the spicy fish stew instead of the non-spicy fish stew, and the wonton soup without the noodles. So, 0/3 in order accuracy. That said, what we received was still solid and tasty. We enjoyed the spicy fish stew, which was accompanied by white rice, most of all. The authentic Sichuan dish is spicy, so perhaps it worked out that we got to try the hot version. It's almost like the staff thought they knew what we would like more, and took matters into their own hands in delivering the better product. The white fish chunks, perhaps flounder or the like, was so tender and soft.The wonton soup and smashed cucumbers were also delicious and good quality, though not particularly noteworthy. I'm not sure we would return specifically for the hotpot, even though hotpot is in the restaurant's name. But it certainly does many other dishes reliably well.",0
I feel like you can never go wrong with any pizza place in NYC but this turned out to be an underwhelming choice. Pricey per piece and nothing really special. The only item I enjoyed is the pizza with lemon zest which I guess is unique but it's not the kind of place I'd crave for when I want pizza.,0
"Wow, wow, wow! The food really brightened up my boring quarantined day. I ordered Uber eats and my food came in 25 minutes - piping hot. The classic French dip sandwich - all I can say is ""wow!"" My husband and I both thought it was the best sandwich we ever had. Also got hash browns, Mac and cheese, and onion soup, and loved everything. Also ordered the Oreo cake and chocolate layer cake. Oreo cake was my hands down winner between the two - and it was delicious! I'm a big fan of Maison Pickle!",1
"My friends dragged me here. So I tried their chicken leg over rice, sweet and sour soup and also something else. It was disappointing. Not come back here",0
"Come here on a Friday afternoon around 5. It wasn't busy at all. As we walked in the waitress greeted us and led us to our seat. Chill environment. We ordered three sliders, wings and tater tots. The tater tots were delicious. The wings was good but kind of spicy. The three sliders was okay. I felt like it was over price for three small portions of sliders. Had to order extra because it was not enough for 5 people. When we tried to order extra sliders, our waiter said he'll put it in the works. However, we saw him walk out of the door. When we finished our food, we asked where our other slider was and the waitress that helped us said they forgot. The waitress also gave an attitude when we were asking for our food. The service was slow even though it wasn't busy.",0
"So we were really hyped to get out and try Lure. Heard some good things from people so considered this a must try. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. We ordered a bunch of stuff so we can get a taste of everything. We also did show up during brunch so the menu was a bit different. The bang bang shrimp was probably the best value. They gave you a ton of shrimp for a reasonable price. The deviled eggs I could of done without, and usually that's my favorite part of a meal. The hamachi was the most flavorful and definitely our favorite part of the meL. The lobster dumplings were very bland. And the nigiri was decent, just like any other sushi spot. Oysters were solid snd shucked perfectly, we were very pleased with those. Unfortunately I won't be going back to lure, for the price you can sit at mostly any top omakase spot and get a way better experience and meal.",0
"3 stars and little to add, as the 3 stars tells the story about this place....ok, let's give it a try to add some level of insight:- Came here for a casual business lunch- Atmosphere is ehhhh, at best- Looks like there is an upper-level, but we weren't seated there, nor did I bother to take a look- Service?  About a step down from your average diner- Food quality?  Salad + pizza, both were average, at best....especially disappointing to not get good pizza in NYC, with so many options!- Pricing?  Based on the above-mentioned....well overpriced, IMOWould I come back here again?  No!  One and done!",0
"I came to this restaurant after reading the good reviews and I have to say, I was not disappointed! The baked goods were sitting out all day - and they were still delicious! I can never resist a bakery, and this place didn't disappoint in that department either. I loved the red bean donut covered in sugar, and the egg tarts were also really good. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good bakery experience.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The decor is really cute and the service was great. The drinks were just ok, but I really enjoyed the salad and my friend enjoyed the quesadilla. The music was great and really set the mood. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! It was just three of us, but we shared the BBQ combo 1 and the spicy pork soup. The meat was tender and tasty, and I especially liked the thinly spliced beef. The garlic dipping sauce and lettuce added the perfect touch. The waitress was very friendly and nicely sliced and served the meat. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place!",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant. The staff was welcoming and our food came quickly. The pork belly was delicious and the pickled veggies added a nice touch. It was a bit salty for my taste, but overall a great meal. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.",1
"The rooftop setting at Pentacle is really lovely and the view is fantastic. The bottomless brunch is a huge plus and the pulsd deal is great - half off is definitely worth it. Chicken and biscuit was delicious, steak and eggs was good and potatoes were not memorable, but they were serviceable. Service could use some work, but we were able to track down a lot of staff in order to make orders. The music was funky, but not very festive. We made a reservation and were sat about 20 minutes after our reservation, but I received a free drink for my troubles. #dope. Pentacle did not have any reservations spots open, but there were plenty when I called in. The sangria tasted kind of weird and I liked the mimosas better. The mimosas were more on the juice side.",1
"Surprisingly pleased. Went for brunch and sat outside -- not sure we'd do that again, but the service was great, and loved the abundance of options to choose from. The burger and grilled chicken sandwich were cooked perfectly and filled with flavor. Would love to return for their dinner service next time.",0
"I had a great time at Porgy! The Reel Deal with Porgy was very tasty and I could tell it was cooked very well. The Fish and Chips was also great, and I loved how light and healthy it tasted. The ambience of the place is beautiful, and the music was amazing too! I highly recommend Porgy to anyone looking for a great meal!",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was amazing and the service was great! I really appreciated that everything on the menu was exactly what came out - no missing ingredients or surprises. The flavors were amazing and I really enjoyed every dish that came out! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal!,1
"David Chang is one of my favorite celebrity chefs. I've only been to a few of his restaurants in Vegas and I loved it. Moving to New York, I was extremely excited that I would get a chance to eat at his establishments. I took the chance on a Friday night to try a walk-in. The friendly servers were able to pencil me in for a 7:30 resy. The menu is fairly small and consist of Raw dishes, Country, Ham, Small, Off-Cuts, and Large dishes. The waiter recommended that we get 2-3 smalls and a large to share.Food:Pork Belly Buns (off-menu) - The porkbelly was cooked so well. The spicy sauce gave it a really nice kick!Max's Curry and Potatoes-  burrata, spinach, garam masala - wow who would have though that curry and burrata would make such a good combo! I really loved the combination of the creamy burrata with the curry and potatoesFoie Gras over Rice - matcha furikake, preserved plums - i'm so happy that foie is not banned in this city like in SF. This dish came with a hefty portion of foie and the matcha furikake sauce really worked with the dish. I loved the crunchiness from the rice as wellWhole Roasted Fish Saam - ginger scallion, bean sprouts, herbs - you cant go to this restaurant and not get a saam dish. Ssam, meaning ""wrapped"", refers to a dish in Korea where you wrap usually meat or pork in a lettuce wrap. The fish came completely deboned so you were able to just scope the perfectly cooked fish in the wraps. I loved the ginger scallion sauce and the fresh herbs.I enjoyed every dish that we ordered. Service was decent. The only negative is that the tables are really close to each other so you are hearing other peoples conversations. The momofuku hype is real and I can't wait to try his other establishments!",0
"We ordered the pork shoulder tacos, nachos, margarita, and mezcalita. In the end it was a mixed bag, leaning towards a very mediocre experience. Pros:- Pork shoulder tacos were okay;- Drinks were okay;- Service was nice. Cons:- I am pretty sure that the nachos were reheated and not freshly made. We ate a bit, but left most of it because it just had a stale taste. We had better nachos in neighborhood dive bars;- The drinks were okay; however, very tiny (and I am not expecting a bucket) and extremely expensive for the quantity.- Overall, very expensive for what it has to offer. Staff was nice and the location is great, but I am generally going to a restaurant for the food. I can't recommend. I regret not going further uptown to arguably one of the best Mexican restaurants, El Parador.",0
I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always so delicious and the delivery is always on time. I've ordered from here twice and both times the food was great. The first time I ordered the spicy basil fried rice with crispy pork belly and it was so good. The rice is so fluffy and the pork belly is so crispy. The second time I ordered the spicy basil fried rice but with chicken and it was even better. The chicken was so tender and the rice was so flavorful. I also ordered the spring rolls both times and they were both really good. The portion is decent and not too expensive. I highly recommend this restaurant!,1
"Overall, I thought this restaurant was pretty average. The ramen was good, but I think a better cut or preparation would serve the dish better. The pork bun was also good, but I wish there was more actual meat on it. The atmosphere was good, but the service could use some improvement. All in all, I think this would be a good spot for a quick meal if you're in the area.",1
"Joe's on Carmine St. is the perfect place to visit if you're looking for some classic New York City food. The pizza is absolutely delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual meal. The only downside is that the place is quite small, so it can get crowded pretty quickly.",1
"I always have a great time at this restaurant. The food is always cheap and good, and the wait time is never too long. I definitely recommend it!",1
This is a newer spot in the neighborhood and it is one of the best margarita deals on the upper east side. For $15 you get a very large (and STRONG) frozen margarita that's blended perfectly. The tables are a bit close together given the covid situation and the service was a little slow but our waitress was so nice! Will definitely be back here.,0
"We had a tasty, very filling lunch here, though the arepas themselves were generally thinner, crispier, and a little drier than I'd prefer. Don't let them sit too long or the bottom half will get very soggy! Also, two arepas was way too much, even though I was crazy hungry. 1.5 would have been perfect.This is a tiny space that fills up fast, the tables are close, and there is one server. It's also cozy & homey there.THE WAIT: None on a Sunday at 12:11pm, but within 20 minutes it'd filled up and there was a wait outside!THE FOOD: La del gato with black beans (4.5 stars), followed by De pabellon (4 stars). The Miss PIggy was more soggy and less interesting (3.5 stars).See my photos for additional details!",0
"Much better than expected. The beef filet was very good, well prepared and tender with asparagus and potatoes.  The salmon was fine.  Crab cakes were quite good.  The berries desert was huge and good.  The apple tart was very good. A three course dinner for four with one glass of wine for three people was around $420 with tax and tip.",0
"I've been to teppen twice and both times were good experiences. The restaurant isn't very large and probably has around 10 tables but it's a nice homey feel and very casual. I've never had to make a reservation and the longest I've ever had to wait was 10 minutes. My favorite appetizers are rhe karage and we always order our own portions as it's so addictive. Each portion comes with about 3 pieces. The fried tofu is a light app that I like since their tofu has great silky texture. You can't go wrong with ordering any of their ramen on the menu. They broth is smooth and doesn't have a sandy gritty feel that some other broths can have. The noodles are never mushy or overcooked. They have both straight and the curly noodles. Their spicy ramen are a fan favorite but isn't super spicy. I recently tried their clear vegetable broth and I really loved it. It was light and flavorful and hit the spot on a cold rainy day, but it was limited in number. I haven't gotten any drinks here but they have the usual selection of Japanese beers. Overall teppen is now a go to for casual no fuss ramen that's reasonably priced for being in the city.",0
"The burgers were really good, but the fries and onion rings were cold and not very fresh. The service was OK, but it took a long time for our food to come (30+ minutes). If the food was warmer and fresher, this would have been a 4-star review.",1
"Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was cozy and sort of like a family-style dining spot, and the music was really good. The only downside was that my margarita was not very strong - I wound up feeling a bit woozy after drinking it. But everything else - the catfish, the mac n cheese, the collard greens - all tasted great. The only thing I didn't like was the slimy texture of the collard greens - but the waiter did reheat them for me and that remedied the issue. Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.",1
"Came by for lunch the other day and it was a quick and easy experience. The line moved quick during the lunch rush and staff wore gloves.Had a wrap with hummus, grilled chicken along with mixed greens. The chicken seems to have been pre-made and parts of it was slightly dry. The mixed greens and hummus was good though.This was wrapped twice, once in wax paper, and once in aluminum foil, and placed inside a compostable box for easy transport!$13 for lunch and they take Mastercard!",0
"No better place to represent NYC pizza like Prince street pizza ! Gotta go with the pepperoni slice , take my advise order two because one is never enough!! Be prepare there is usually always a line but it goes by pretty fast.Honestly,  I never understood why they don't open a bigger place to accommodate more people. I personally would frequent here more often especially because i work right down the block but it usually takes at least 30 minutes to get my slice so that's basically my entire lunch hour just wanting on line! But I get it maybe the hype of always having a line out the door draws in more people and makes the attraction more so special!",0
"I had a great time at YunShang Rice Noodle House! The soup was delicious and comforting, and I liked all the seasonings/toppings it came with. Ordered the original soup with added beef and loved it. My mom enjoyed hers too, and she's pretty picky when it comes to Chinese cuisine. The interior is clean and well-maintained. Maybe not worth going out of your way for, but if you're in the area and debating where to go for lunch, I'd keep this place in mind.",1
"I visited this restaurant for dinner and it was a great experience. The service was great and the servers were friendly and polite. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy and it took a while for a bar seat to become available. Otherwise, everything else about the experience was great. The food was delicious and the price was reasonable for what you got. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I tried the grill cactus taco at this restaurant and it was not good. The cactus just tasted like a boiled Brussel sprout. No crisp, no real flavor, no texture just boiled veggie on a taco. We wound up throwing half of it away. Maybe they have something else that would be better but this was a hard pass for me.",1
"Wo Hop is a delicious Chinese restaurant in Chinatown that I highly recommend. The food was some of the best I've ever had, and the service was very prompt. They even served everything in take out containers so packing up leftovers was a breeze. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I'm a little underwhelmed with the food despite everything I've heard from friends. I have to admit, the first time I taste tested the oxtail soup, I swore I was going to order one for myself the next time I came. And so I did, but I was underwhelmed and didn't even finish my food. I also tried the cheesesteak empanada - also underwhelmed. I must have been hungry the first time I tried their empanadas because they tasted so much better then. Will have to give this place another try just to be sure. It might just be an issue of inconsistency?",0
"The food was amazing and the service was great. The only downside was that the pre-fix menu was not what we were expecting, but all in all it was a great experience. I would definitely go back!",1
Really cute setup for covid. The only downside is they are really strict with their 90 min seating. Seats are heated. It's small so if your okay with the seating arrangement then it's fine. We ordered the fries which were good. I think they are flavored with a bit of yellow curry powder. The burrata toast was really tasty and we also shared the burger and cheesecake. All the food was really good and during happy hour the price is right. I would def return here for a casual good meal. The inside is really cute so I'm hopeful indoor dining will resume soon.,0
"Decent place in Manhattan when you are craving for some XiaoLongBao like me. You cant simply just get that though. I order a rice dish on the side as well and it was pretty decent, just a bit too saucy and thick. I still recommend the Xiao Long Bao though. A good indicator of good and bad Xiao Long Bao is what it is served in and how delicate and but structured the skin is. In this case, it came steamed in a circular steam plate (places where they have it in foil are not okay) and the skin never broke after I picked it up in chopsticks. For Xiaolongbao first timers: Xiaolongbao is usually meant to be eaten immediately so it doesn't soggy and so that the soup remains fresh and hot. You usually try to eat it in one bite but sometimes the soup is simply too hot. This is what I do: Holding the soup spoon in one hand, pick up the Xiaolongbao with chopsticks with your other hand, take a bite out of the skin and let the soup drip into the soup spoon, let it cool, and drink. Then with your open-hole Xiaolongbao, dip it in the ginger vinegar sauce and then proceed to eat it after you have drank the soup already. This is so you can get the best of both without the incineration of your tongue (it also enables more sauce-age for your xiaolongbao as well). This makes xiaolongbao quite an adventure to eat. Will come back when I visit new york again! This place is tucked on a nice street near Chelsea.",0
"New York has such a lack of good vietnamese restaurants, that sometimes you just have to settle for a place that offers solid food. I was craving Vietnamese food on a cold night, but also wanted to try somewhere I hadn't been before, which led us to Tu Do early on a Saturday evening. We came in at around 5-5:30pm. The restaurant was mostly empty, aside from one table of two diners. We ordered two mains, and one appetizer to share, the banh xeo. My husband had the vermicelli with spring rolls, while I had the canh chua for my main. Everything was pretty standard, not bad, but not amazing. I wouldn't say this is a must-go place for Vietnamese, not even close to that, but if you are in the area, this is a decent choice. The staff were nice, and prices were very cheap.",0
"I found this place by accident, and I should've just kept moving. Trattoria Dell'Arte is busy on a Friday afternoon, and considering it's across the street from Carnegie Hall, they probably get a lot of traffic from tourists and out-of-towners. Service was good, but everyone was attentive only to a point. The food is mediocre at best and quite pricey for lunch with entrees between $20-$30 and above. I got the Prix-fixe for $32, and that's totally not worth it! First, they served both starters and main course together, so I had to toggle back and forth just so my food didn't get cold. The braised octopus and calamari was ok, but the Seafood Papardelle was bland. I was so turned off by the food that I didn't even get my dessert that came with the meal. Maybe there is a reason why they have 4 stars on Yelp... food isn't one of them.",1
"Came here this past weekend with the hubby to try some UES ramen, especially since we live so close. It was pretty easy to get a table for 2 on a Sunday around 1pm. The place wasn't packed, but most of the tables were full. The ambience was pretty cute and it was well decorated. There were some tables with hooks on the wall to hang a coat, but we unfortunately got a table with nowhere to put our jackets so I ended up sitting on mine. The waiters came fairly quickly to get our order and allowed us to substitute certain things! I got the tonkotsu (asked for braised pork instead of shredded) and hubs got the meijin beef ramen. My tonkotsu was pretty decent - had decent flavors (but probably not the best I've had), with some mayu in it. It came with two extreeemely thin slices of pork belly, marinated egg, and some wood ear. The pork belly was actually pretty good -- had a smokey flavor to it which I don't think I've had at other restaurants before, but was so thin! It also was more rubbery than the usual melt-in-your-mouth type pork belly I look forward to with ramen. The half marinated egg was good, but again, not the best I've had. It was a nicely soft-boiled jelly texture with some flavor though. I usually also split my entrees with my husband so of course had to try his meijin beef ramen. The beef broth was decent, but nothing special. His didn't even come with an egg :( The beef was not that tender, kinda dry? Seemed like those cheap pieces of london broil beef that you get for a grocery store, honestly. For $16, was kind of disappointing. Both bowls of noodles also were averagely sized. At least they used our favorite yellow Japanese ramen noodles! Overall, think there are definitely better ramen places out there to try.",0
"I've ordered a couple times from East River Eatery which has become our go-to for sesame chicken, dumplings etc. Ordering from seamless it has come exactly as expected (ETA wise if not earlier) and it's been nicely presented as well which is an added bonus. I haven't tried the soup dumplings because I find in general they don't travel well but I'm eager to try them next time based on some of the other yelpers reviews.",0
"I had a great time at Havana Central! The wings were delicious and the delivery was quick. The empanada trio was a great appetizer, and the shredded beef dish was also really good. The only downside was that I can't remember the name of the other dish. But overall, I really enjoyed my meal.",1
"Stopped by with 2 friends for a quick lunch after visiting a nearby museum. The restaurant has a rustic brick interior and a nice cozy feel. The place wasn't crowded so we figured service would be fairly prompt. Wrong! We only ordered sandwiches but they took over 30 minutes to arrive at the table. One of my friends finally reminded our server that we were waiting, then our food appeared quickly. Were we forgotten or dissed? Hard to tell as other tables were served more quickly. On the plus side my caprese sandwich was delicious, a thick slab of fresh mozzarella cheese with fresh tomatoes and pesto on toasted bread served with a small side salad. My friends both had the chicken sandwich which they pronounced excellent. While the food was very good I don't know if I'd return due to the slow forgetful service.",0
"Overall, I thought this restaurant was decent. It's a bit small, but the service was great. The only downside is that the food is a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it. I especially liked the smoked plum juice!",1
Dagon is a great addition to the neighborhood. I've had every single mezze plate in the couple times I've been. Loved their Sahara Old Fashioned and the lamb. The Jerusalem bagel is a real highlight and somehow we had Shah as our amazing server both times. I highly recommend this restaurant!,1
"Have been getting their Thai food for over a year now. Overall, we usually go with the chicken pad Thai, pad see ew, or masaman curry. All are very tasty and you can never go wrong mixing the three together. For starters, the chicken and shrimp dumplings are amazing and a must try. One thing that stands out about Opai over other Thai restaurants is their portions. Usually we have enough leftovers for THREE MEALS! Def one of the best meals as far as value and cost. They will continue to be one of our go tos for Thai.",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really cozy and the food was fantastic. However, I did find the service to be a bit lackluster at times. I think they could do a better job of making guests feel welcome and ensuring that they are getting the best experience possible. Additionally, I wasn't crazy about the fact that I had to give my credit card information in order to reserve a table - it just felt a bit too ""posh"" for my taste. All things considered, though, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!",1
"I stopped by on Sunday Afteroon for a snack and tea while waiting on my spa appointment. It was raining so  I stopped here. They were within Covid guidelines which is good. I was seated after the host took my temp. The server came right over with water and explained QR for menus. I wanted something light so I ordered the donuts because they sound so good and Chai tea. The Chai tea arrived first it was lukewarm but I still drank it. Next the donuts arrive. I was so happy to get them until I cut into them. They were hard as a brick! I understand the difference between crispy and hard/stall. I told the waitress I was not fond of the donuts so she asked if I wanted anything else. I ordered the fries.  They were fried beyond repair but I ate what I could but I did enjoy the spicy ketchup that came with them.

I give the customer service a 5 out of 5. The food a 2 out of 5 for some creativity but the execution lacked. The picture of the donuts is attached.",1
"Harold's is a restaurant that definitely has a unique quality to it. The pace of the meal is definitely something to be aware of, as it can be a bit fast-paced. However, the food is so good that it's worth it! The deviled eggs were my favorite dish, and the Norwegian pancakes were also very good. The only downside to the meal was that the fries were not particularly good. Overall, though, I had a great time at Harold's and would definitely recommend it!",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The sushi is always fresh and the service is always polite. The atmosphere is really homey and the cocktails are delicious. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded, so make sure to make a reservation. Overall, I highly recommend this spot!",1
"I was really disappointed with El Corazon Mexican Restaurant. The restaurant is HUGE and the decor is nice, but the music was really bad and the service wasn't great. I was seated right away, but I found it weird that they had a bouncer at the entrance to the restaurant. The drink menu wasn't very appealing to me and I thought they would have more Mexican-themed drinks considering it's a Mexican restaurant. They didn't have Patron either, which was weird. The guacamole was average and I didn't like the steak nachos that much. The quesadilla was great though. I won't be returning, but I do think it's a good place for tourists to check out.",1
"The stars are solely based on the customer service that was received. NOT on the food! I decided to come her for brunch to give this establishment another try. I will be honest and say the food for brunch was amazing. I was ready to really update my review and give 5 starts. Butt..... towards the end of our time there our server gave us the check and we continue to have our convos. She then came back and had the nerves to  tell us ""I just need you to sign the receipt and you are all set."" I've never been told that before. So it was very weird. I even had to mention to her I have been to many restaurants before. We know that we have to sign... and she says. Oh I thought you didn't know. What would make this lady think we wouldn't know that we have to sign our check with a pen attached. It just seemed to be under false perception for whatever reason but it was not at all warranted and we felt uncomfortable. Please train your servers on what's appropriate to tell customers because we were offended by that statement. We were also the only group she did that to. Nonetheless, we still left her a tip. Although I enjoyed the brunch and would recommend I'm unsure if I can return to this establishment based on that interaction. For reference we ordered: Steak & eggs (was pretty good) Crab Benedict (Amazing!) The Bellini is extremely syrupy so be aware. I had Prosecco bc they wouldn't substitute any of the juices for cranberry.",0
"Had a recent 3 star experience at Jin Ramen.  It's a good-looking space, decorated with some flair, tables and bar tightly squeezed in; true NYC style. Sharing an appetizer, we tried veggie buns, like typical pork buns but replacing the pork with tofu. The tofu was a bit chewy and tasted too much of the oil it was fried in. The bun was bready and seemed sort of stale. As for the entrees, one dish (Miso ramen) was perfect. The second, a hot noodle dish with fried chicken pieces, wasn't great. The chicken was tasty, but the noodles were so drenched in a broth that was flat and a bit oily, overall it wasn't nearly as impressive as the ramen.I would go back for the ramen, but would skip the other two dishes that were tried.",0
"Baby Brasa does not disappoint with their beautiful atmosphere, but their food falls short. The chicken empanadas were unavailable, so I had to order the grilled chicken. The chicken was only okay- it wasn't very flavorful and it was quite small for the price. The rice was really salty, so I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a healthy meal. The tables were wobbly and my drink got spilled over, but the waiter was very nice and replaced it without any extra charge. Overall, Baby Brasa is a nice restaurant but their food does not meet my high expectations.",1
"This place always hits the spot for a Saturday brunch! The service is always awesome, and the waiter had gloves and masks on, which was really cool. The food always tastes great, and we didn't have to wait too long for it either. I'm so happy this place is back open!",1
"I love Bread & Butter! It's slightly over priced, but what deli in NYC isn't! Plus it's in a very convenient location for work, so I'm basically a regular at this point. The guys behind the deli always joke around when me and are very pleasant when I order my food. I do love their açaí bowls as well! But I usually tend to go for a breakfast wrap due to cost. They have lots of options if you're looking for a variety on your lunch hour, I'd definitely recommend to stop in if you need some options.",0
"This place was ok. The tables very close together. It was  hard to maneuver out to go to the bathroom or exit the restaurant. We had the catfish clay pot, it was really tasty. Also the Chinese  broccoli was great, the papaya salad was reallyy tasty ( a bit spicy) the short rib  was good typical korean style. Lastly we had the shrimp pad ke mow which I really like talk to you later crispy fried basil. If yOu go before 7pm it's happy hour!This place would be good  to catch upp with friends. They had a long line so they  were kind of rushing us.The place is reasonable for a restaurant near Times Square.",0
"We've gotten Chola takeout twice during COV19, and both times we absolutely loved it.  We've been mostly boring with Chicken Vindaloo and Butter Chicken, but also got a south indian coconut curry that we really loved.  Food is fresh and flavorful, Vindaloo is as spicy as promised.  Will definitely keep coming back.",0
"Was worried given the reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. Very classic diner look on the inside and very clean. The waiter was great, John was very friendly, funny, and attentive. Made for a very nice experience. Food was good, what you would expect from a New York diner. Home made marinara sauce with mozzarella sticks was very good, sausage was great (not typical Pattie's), and chocolate shake was excellent.",0
Pho Bar is a modern traditional Pho restaurant. It's a casual space with friendly service and it is cash only. The ingredients used in the food is of high quality and def comes out in the taste. The beef used in the Pho is super fresh and delicious. The broth is pretty legit. The oxtail Pho was super tender and full of flavor. The wings were just ok and could have used a little more sweetness. Looking forward to my next meal here.,0
"Il Violino is a great Italian restaurant that offers delicious food and a great atmosphere. I really enjoyed my meal here, and the pasta was really fresh and had great flavor. I got the fettuccini with shrimp & porcini and the sauce it was in was truly excellent. The only thing I didn't like about the meal was that we were crammed into a very small table in a corner, even though it looked like there were a lot of open tables. It would be great if they offered larger tables so that everyone could be seated comfortably. The service was also unnoticeable, but that didn't bother me too much. Overall, I would definitely recommend Il Violino to anyone looking for a great Italian meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The wait wasn't too bad, and the atmosphere was really cool - they had an outdoor seating area on both sides of the street. The food was really good, and the portions were really generous. I especially loved the duck noodle soup, the stuffed cabbage, and the crab fried rice. The only thing I didn't like was the French toast - it wasn't my favorite. But overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant!",1
"Fantastic. high quality, healthy food that I frequently order delivery from. When a friend wanted to meet near the Queensboro bridge for lunch - they were riding their bike from Queens into the city - this was my top choice. Very happy I did. We both ordered the veggie combo that comes with falafels, hummus, baba ghanouj  and a salad and very generous quantities of pita bread. Wonderful service too. Very sweet, pleasant. Clean place. I brought leftovers from my combo home that my son devoured immediately. Their yogurt sauce is fantastic and my son even added it to his next meal of chicken and rice. Give it a try. You won't regret it.",0
"Sexy Taco is back and better than ever! I've been a fan of this restaurant for a long time and I'm glad to have a good sit down taco spot in this area. The drink menu is stacked with other delicious sounding drinks, but I had to go with a Hurricane Caesar drink - it was so good. The food is just as good as I remembered it from their old location - I had the Lamb Asado Negro taco and it was just as good. The nachos were still stacked high with toppings and the guacamole was fresh and nicely acidic. The chips are served fresh and warm, which is important! I'll be back for more soon.",1
"I don't necessarily eat enough Italian food or pasta to really say if it's the best pasta or anything. All I can say is that my taste buds liked this and I'd come again! Bucatini pomodoro was our favorite. Everyone here was so friendly, even the guy folding pizza boxes on the side was friendly. The food was also good. The only downside is that the restaurant was pretty small and it was pretty busy, so it was hard to get a seat.",1
"Full disclosure:11 Little Italy stores participated in the Netflix promotion of the Irishman that happen this past Friday and Saturday, it became a treasure hunt/food tour for me. This was my first stop of the promotion.  I didn't know what to expect.  Though, I heard about other people experience while waiting on line.  I haven't heard of this pizza place so I was wondering about the quality and type of pizza.  When it was my turn, I told the employee, ""tell 'em Jimmy sent you"" and the employee handed me a slice of pizza.  It was a plain piping hot (it off the oven fresh) full size of pizza with organic tomato sauce with a thin crust.  It was the right amount of cheese and tomato sauce for me.Thank you Manero and Netflix for the slice.  Now I know where to go to get my next slice of pizza.",0
"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The ramen was delicious and the staff were so friendly. It was a bit pricey, but it was definitely worth it! I would definitely come back and recommend it to anyone.",1
"I was looking for some good Thai food and this place hit the spot! I got their shrimp pad thai and pad see mao. Both were really delicious dishes. Paid Thai was topped with an poached egg which was great. The shrimps were super tasty as it had a bit of charred flavor. The pad see mao was also very flavorful and topped with some crispy seaweeds. The noodles were at a perfect level of spice. You can ask for additional Thai chili flakes or chili sauce if you need to increase the spice level. The only thing is I wish the portion size was bigger. I was still hungry after eating the entree. I also wanted to try their spare ribs on sugar cane which is michelen recommended but they ran out of sugar cane, so that appetizer was not available. But other than that, the food was great and definitely recommend!",1
"Always a great experience. The flavors in the meat + you grill, they have already been beautifully set.. You just execute!",0
"I visited this restaurant for the third time this past weekend and I have to say that I'm disappointed. The skewers are still tiny and overpriced and the escargot was quite delicious but the fusion flavor was a bit too much for my taste. The duck entree was also delicious, but the cocktails were still light and tiny and too sweet for me. I would recommend this restaurant to someone else, but I don't think I'll be returning myself.",1
I stopped by this restaurant later in the evening and was pleasantly surprised. The ramen was good and there was a variety of options to choose from. The location is perfect for those in the heart of K-town. The only downside was that it was a bit noisy and some of the patrons were getting a bit rowdy. I would definitely recommend this place to others.,1
"I came here with my cousin for dinner and we were not impressed by the service however. Apparently they had a big party inside, but it took us 45 min to get our food and they also got my cousin's order wrong. The food was fairly tasty though. We also tried the calamari and it was good. I would say it's worth checking out if you're looking for a basic Irish pub with good food.",1
"We went to Upland for dinner and had a pretty mixed experience. The food was good, but the service was very slow. We spent much of the evening waiting for courses and asking each other when they might come, which always detracts from the experience. And it took so long that we decided to forego dessert and just got ice cream on the way home. Our waiter rarely checked in as well, and although we understand kitchen delays aren't on wait staff, an indication that the food is taking a while or an occasional refill of water can't hurt! Overall, if Upland gets its service back on track, we'd happily go back for the food.",1
"Overall, I thought the experience was okay and the food was good, but definitely overhyped. I think it's definitely of interest because of the private booths, but the food wasn't anything TOO special to me. I would recommend it to someone who's looking for an interesting eating experience, but not necessarily the best ramen they've ever had. The private booths can be really fun if you're looking for that kind of thing, but it's not my cup of tea. The staff were nice though.",1
"I admit, I was a little bit disappointed when we received our reservation notice and learned that our table was not actually on the boat. We were seated instead on the sidewalk next to the boat dock. Despite that setback, the rest of our evening was enjoyable. The food was delicious - definitely worth the price tag. I wish the restaurant had better lighting though; it was a bit too dark to really appreciate the setting. Overall, I would recommend this spot for a romantic dinner - just be prepared for the long wait.",1
I wish that the service was on par with the food. I didn't have a good experience here but would recommend it if you do not mind being confronted by other waiting patrons and told to leave. Management sat there wide eyed like while a groups of 5 women and one man asked me to leave while my party had gone to the bathroom and were taking care of the check. I was cursed out and disrespected and I was EXTREMELY displeased with that. I ordered the Paloma which wasn't too great very watered down. The video I posted of the churros on my social media got over 600 views but I won't tell you what else I ordered or anything nice as I will not return. More over I feel like the management should step their game up as I wouldn't want anyone else to be verbally assaulted. Not cool.,0
"Overall, the experience at this restaurant was average. The food didn't taste as spicy as I'm used to, and some items, like the chicken dry item, were ok. However, the poondu kozhambu was really good and the gulab jamun was outstanding. The service was good and the waitstaff was quick. I would recommend this restaurant for a once in a while meal, but not as a regular go-to spot.",1
"Just went here today and got their Kind Brother pizza with white sauce, cheese, egg and mushrooms. It was pretty good. Very flavorful, a little on the rich side, but overall good. The black pepper was a nice touch. And the crust was really good. Overall wood fire pizza! Interested to try their other pizzas!",0
"After finishing up an appointment I wanted to get brunch somewhere with a nice setting, a relatively healthy menu and outdoor seating.   A quick search on the ol' Yelp app found Harvest Kitchen so I headed on over there (a quick walk from the Museum of Natural History).At the moment my comfort level with restaurant indoor seating varies, but on this day I wanted to sit outside.  That said, I did use the rest room so I went inside and was delighted to see how beautiful the interior was. Modern with classic elements, I wish I had sat inside (it was also mostly empty when I was inside).   The outdoor seating area is right in front of the restaurant and looks nice. It's not just a shack thrown onto the street.  Some effort went into making it look like an inviting setting.I wound up ordering a frittata with cheese, turkey sausage and caramelized onion.  By default it comes with a side of fries (or I'm guessing home fries during regular brunch hours) but I asked for a salad instead and they obliged.  Throughout my wait for my food and the meal itself, I am going to give the waiter props for consistently keeping my water glass full.  He was attentive and checked on all the tables regularly.  It was hot outside on this day, and I really respected his resilience and hard work.The frittata came much quicker than I had expected, and it was a substantial size.  Had I not skipped breakfast that day I may not have been able to finish it!  I enjoyed the frittata but I will say I wish there had been more turkey sausage in it.  The side salad was well dressed and fresh.  Overall it was a good meal!While the food did not knock my socks off, the combination of good food with excellent service earns Harvest four stars from me.",0
"Gluten free and dairy free!  I stopped by By The Way Bakery around 4pm on a Sunday.  There was no line at this time.  There is a small bench (seats 2 people) to sit on outside, but this is more of a grab-and-go place.  The person who helped me was friendly and explained what the more popular items were and gave me the prices for each item.After much deliberation, I decided on a mini lemon poppy cake ($5).  The cake was about the size of a standard supermarket cupcake.  The cake had a nice lemon flavor and was very close to my desired moist consistency, which I did not expect for a gluten and dairy free treat.  However, I thought the size of the cake was a little steep for $5.  I'm sure the ingredients they use to substitute for dairy and gluten are what contribute to the price.  Overall, if you have dietary restrictions, By The Way Bakery is a solid choice!  I would return to By The Way but their cake wasn't so delicious that I would frequently pay the extra bucks.",0
"The Boil is a great restaurant with great service and delicious food. However, their happy hour is a bit short and they still only accept cash.",1
"Overall, I thought the meal at this restaurant was quite good. The food was beautiful to look at and tasted great. However, I did not enjoy the level of service here. Our waitress seemed very rushed and uninterested in helping us enjoy our meal. Additionally, I was disappointed that they weren't able to accommodate our dessert tasting menu request - this perhaps ruined the overall dining experience for us. All in all, I thought it was a great place to eat, but I'm not sure I would go back due to the high price tag.",1
"Very nice actually. And it might've been an even higher rating if they hadn't of charged us for a dish we really wanted but then replaced it with something not as good without us realizing it. Also, I have to grade on a bit of a curve here because I find that most Cantonese spots in NYC don't necessarily do Chinese BBQ so well.That said, their roast meats are pretty tasty, and their wontons, as you can imagine, are amazing. Other items: sticky rice, steamed buns, etc... all very good. Just make sure you check your bag and make sure you have everything you ordered before you leave.",0
"I was really impressed with this restaurant! The delivery was quick and the food was really good. I ordered the paneer tikka masala, medium spice, and it was really spicy without being too sweet. It came with rice, which I didn't realize was included in the price, and the naans were also great. I'll definitely be ordering from here again!",1
"This restaurant started out poorly for us, as we arrived ten minutes early for our reservation and were told to wait in the lounge area. After waiting for 25 minutes, meaning fifteen minutes later it still was not ready. While this is only a one star Michelin restaurant, the service expectations should be better. The hostess already had a bad attitude, which was not appreciated upon check-in. The restaurant closes at 9:30pm, so we were finally escorted to our table. We were given water and ordered a cocktail based on the waiter's recommendation. Bread was provided, which was cold, the butter was room temperature which is good, as it's easy to smear. We ordered the soft shell crab and lobster soup as appetizers. The crab was ok, but not outstanding, and the soup was almost room temperature. There were nice pieces of lobster in there, though. We had the ravioli and the squid ink pasta for our main dish. The ravioli was stuffed with cheese and potato and it was rather bland, while the squid ink pasta was by far much more flavorful. Neither of these would warrant a revisit here. We opted out of dessert but were given complementary almond cookies, which was kinda cool, not warm. Too many other great",1
"I had the pleasure of trying Hong Chun Cheon's Dakgalbi and I have to say it was amazing! The food was well portioned, very flavorful, and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious Korean dish.",1
"I was really excited to try Bar Lula! It's suppose to be the same owners as Goodnight Sonny (my favorite bar in EV) and of course, right next door. We went on one of the coldest days in January (15 degrees maybe?!) and had a reservation at 8pm. We sat at the large table by the window and I would not recommend this on a really cold day. IT WAS FREEZING! I was shivering while eating and drinking. I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem most nights but I really hope they are able to get some space heaters etc because it seemed to be the fact that the windows weren't insulated. Sadly, that's why I rated this down a star :( The drinks were creative and fun, definitely giving that Goodnight Sonny vibe and the food was delicious! We ordered: croquettes (delicious, tiny and packed with flavor), mussels (would skip), scallop aguachile (delicious!! but because it was cold and we were cold, it was hard to appreciate it as much lol), beef tartare and roasted octopus I had to skip because of my nut allergy but the rest of the table gobbled it up! The prawns were perfectly cooked and the sauce with it gave it a nice flavor. The mushroom crepe I would skip... it's just a flatbread with mushrooms.. nothing overly exciting and reminded me of pizza. The winter carrots were a great vegetable choice as well! Who doesn't love a roasted carrot. Overall, great small plates, good atmosphere for friends, great drinks just really cold! Will be back.",0
"I came here for brunch during a weekend and was able to get seated outside and dine al fresco. The brunch menu is wide-ranging - you can indulge and get something like chicken fried steak, but you can also get salads and sandwiches and regular brunch food. I personally got a catfish salad. The catfish was crisp and fresh and light, and I really enjoyed it. They don't mix in the dressing in the salad, which I didn't ask for, but I imagine is just more convenient if most people ask for the dressing to be on the side.I also had a side of corn bread, which had bits of peppers and fresh corn in it. It was a tad bit soggy and on the sweeter side.",0
Stoped by here to get wings. Has a great feel it's narrow. It's clean as hell and the bartender is a lovely girl. Blonde pretty and nice. Wings were dead on. It was quite on a Sunday but started to pic up. I'll give it a go another time,0
"The food is great but there's other issues.  On our last visit we were encouraged to join their ""Landry's select club"" for $25.  I was charged that and given a card and a code to ""register"" online.  I used their app to do so, as described on the flyer we were given and was charged another $25 (!)I sent 3 emails to customer service before getting a response from someone who clearly had not read my message.  It has now been over a week of back and forth and they still have my ""registration"" fee, I have nothing to show for it and I have wasted a lot of my time and energy. I now NEVER want to go back there.  Really really bad, tacky practice.",0
"I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant last week. Our food took a really long time to come out, and instead of getting the ratatouille we had ordered, they brought us the risotto. The person who brought us the risotto was not our original server, and we explained that it was not what we had ordered. They offered to change it, but we didn't want to waste it or wait outside in the cold for another 30 minutes, so we said we would just eat the risotto. In the end, he did not apologize or tell our original server about the mix up. When the bill came, we were charged for the risotto, not the ratatouille. After we explained the situation to our server, he changed the bill to the cost of the ratatouille, but he never apologized for the mix up. His attitude was rude, and he didn't seem to care about what had happened. I probably won't go there again.",1
"I have dined in and ordered take out. They have very fair prices, good service and their banh mi is delicious! Other stand outs include the spicy basil noodles and the cashew mango entree with rice.",0
"I really enjoyed my modern hot pot experience here! I came for dinner on a Wednesday night, and it was surprisingly busy! I had a reservation for 7pm and waited maybe 5-7 minutes or so until our table was ready. One thing you'll notice immediately is the decor--I loved the modern take on it and the attention to detail. For instance, they have these cute pot holders that go around your hotpot to ensure you won't burn yourself on the metal. They also have these disposable bibs you can wear to keep your clothing mess-free. The tables have a large surface area (great for when you order a lot of things) and the cushioned seats are very comfortable. There were a couple of new/fresh takes on the hot pot experience that I appreciated. First, the ordering process is very simple. You can easily select your broth, add-ons, side dishes, and drinks via an iPad. Once you're done, someone will come collect the iPad. Next, I also appreciated how someone came to make our sauce for us (with little dishes of garlic, cilantro, chili flakes, etc). I have always struggled to find the right combination of things when making dipping sauce, so I loved that they did that. For a party of two, we ordered 1 veggie (cabbage), 1 noodle (3 servings), 2 meat (beef tripe, wagyu beef), and 1 seafood dish (fish tofu). I would highly recommend the noodles and boneless wagyu! We also had complimentary edamame and vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cone (which was an awesome surprise)! Someone would also come by every now and then to refill our pots with more hot water--everyone we interacted with was very nice and polite. We left feeling very happy and full.",0
"My first time here and everything was great. Very nice atmosphere. FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. I had the curry pawns which was very good. The curry sauce was amazing. The lychee martini a must  try. I normally don't care for lychee but it was very tasty. Nice Decor ,cute neon sign,great customer service and delicious food .I def will be back very soon!",0
"I'm not sure if eating at the restaurant would've improved our experience, but I don't think I would order take out from here again. Or we may have ordered the wrong entrees. We got the minced pork over rice, the sesame noodle and the zha jiang mian. None of which we would order again for take out. I suspect the take out made the noodles congeal and it was hard to mix them with the sauce.... I wish we hadn't gotten take out and had gone in person instead. Maybe the experience would've been better, but now I'm a little thrown off to try in person.",1
Food was pretty good but I expected a lil better. Mostly giving 3 stars because I made a reservation for 7:30 and then we had to wait until about 8 to get a table. Also my date ordered a gnocchi dish but the waiter came back and said they were out of gnocchi. Very few beers on tap it's mostly just bottles. Super popular place so they must be doing something right but I just wasn't impressed by the experience.,0
"This restaurant wasn't particularly good. My meal consisted of the fried calamari, the steak and the salmon. All three dishes were on the blander side and it was difficult for me to cut the salmon without turning over the bowl. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
Zaad Restaurants is a great place for a quick bite! The chicken pita was delicious and the price was reasonable. I'll definitely be back for more!,1
"Stopped for some take out after work yesterday afternoon. This place Is  overpriced. The portions are very small and they know that the more people drink the looser their wallets and purses become. Not here. Not me. As for the food, I had the Three Amigos roll along with some shrimp dumplings to share with a friend which were pretty good. She ordered a popular item that I can't remember. She did mention that she was still hungry afterwards. As for me,, 'm going to come back on a weekend and see how that goes. They definitely used portion control here as the size of the rolls didn't command the price tag. Not sure how strong the drinks are but I'd be skeptical of potency. Check it out for yourselves and decide. MamaSushi isn't a true sushi restaurant/bar so don't expect a sushi chef to be there running things.",0
"I visited here for Easter, the restaurant was quiet and very very spacious. My husband, sister, baby, and I were seated towards the front of the restaurant on the side so the stroller wouldn't get in anyones way, the restaurant was quite accommodating in that sense, however the wait staff seemed easily irritated and were very pushy.We ordered some mezze and sandwiches for our lunch: shankleesh, meat sambosa, hummus, zatar fries, fatoush salad, and the falafel, chicken shawarma, and regular shawarma sandwiches. For dessert we ordered baklava, Turkish coffee, and mint tea.The food was certainly not impressive, not memorable, and lacked depth. The shankleesh was way too chunky, the feta pieces were so huge it was hard to eat. The meat sambosa was a little *too* meaty, and the hummus lacked depth. The zatar fries were delish, and the fatoush salad was also pretty good but also somehow the most expensive thing we ordered, certainly not worth $16?!The sandwiches were also just ~ok~ nothing special, and the shawarma sandwiches had way too many pickles, and just overall way too many competing flavours.The restrooms were a little weird... you walk in and there's a Mens door on one side, womens on the other, but essentially everyone's walking into the same bathroom. It was clean and did the job but a little strange. I don't think I'd go back with better Mediterranean options in the city!",0
I've been want to try this place ever since it opened up. Finally had the chance to with my sister.The experience here was not bad at all. The service was great as they were very attentive and the food came quickly. I did not find myself loving the soup base as much as I hoped. It definitely made myself feel better about having hotpot though. A healthy side of it. I was very satisfied! BUT when I got home...my stomach was not very happy. I spent the whole night on the toilet...,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant on a weekday evening. The cocktails were around $14 and they were delicious. The food was also decent - I had a chicken Caesar salad and it was really good. The only downside was that there was only one bathroom, which can be a bit of a hassle.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The place was packed on a Sunday afternoon, so my boyfriend and I agreed on sitting at the bar. We were able to have our meal and drinks without waiting!

We ordered the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, hot honey chicken n' toast, and an order of French fries. When we placed our order, the bartender asked us if we wanted to share our food and I was confused as to why she asked that. Anwyays, the portions are HUGE. The food was delicious, and the drinks were amazing. The ""Upper Westside"" was a small drink that packed a punch. The strawberry margarita was refreshing. Like in the middle of our dinner, they decided to dim the lights by the bar and play classic music. The Christmas tree added a nice touch.

The four star rating is because the bartender was very standoffish and looked like she did not want to be there. She billed us, walked away, and did not even hand us the receipt. She did not thank us for bringing business; she did not smile. She was just weird.",1
"I came back again for dinner. I placed an order through open table and request indoor seating. I was initially bummed that they placed us in their outdoor tent. However, it was a rather warm night and there were heat lamps. We ordered the 5 cheeses for 4 people. Definitely recommend as it's fun to share. The manchego cheese was my favorite. I've ordered their fish tacos twice now and they are some of the best I've had. Very good quality fish and extra crispy. A great place to eat during these outdoor dining times.",0
"LoveMama is super affordable and offers a variety of food, but the quality to me was subpar. My friend and I ordered spring rolls, pad thai, and the roti. Each item arrived less than 3 minutes after we ordered them, which was a bit alarming. Each dish was very oily and a bit tasteless, but the portions were generous. If I had to choose a favorite dish, the pad thai was decent but a bit spicy. Maybe we came on an off day, but I thought LoveMama was mediocre at best, but good if you want a cheap and fast meal.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for dinner and was really impressed! The waitstaff was very friendly and the food wasn't the best, but the experience and the wine were both great. I definitely recommend giving this place a try!",1
"I came to Ichiran Midtown for a quick dinner after work and was impressed with the quick service and delicious tonkatsu broth. The broth was rich and flavorful, and I liked how it came out piping hot. I'm not a huge fan of peeling the hard boiled egg myself, but the waitstaff was informative and offered to do it for me. I also enjoyed the noodles and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. I would recommend Ichiran Midtown to anyone looking for a quick and delicious meal.",1
"My first time trying japanese BBQ and I'm impressed. Not sure if all the restaurants from this chain have the same interior concept, but I loved the dining atmosphere of this Gyukaku location. Booth-type seating with high ceilings and a nice street view from the 2nd floor. There is a happy hour lunch special (serves 2) for $55, but we opted for the premium lunch set for $75. Very similar to korean BBQ, but there's no bon chon. Also, the meats taste more seasoned. Loved the salmon appetizer. DIY smores was a cute way to end the lunch. Perfect place for a date or a meal with a friend.",0
"One of the restaurants that I've passed millions of times and never gone in. I got the news that Betty White had just died and I quickly realized I needed a drink. I was stuck on this side of town and decided to stop in a quick drink. Place is beautiful, it wasn't too busy, food was filling.  I decided against a drink and got food instead. I watched the bartenders make outside looking drinks. I decided on food and ordered the Spinach Pie. They brought out some lovely bread with hummus with it. While eating I watched CNN report on Betty White's death on their big screen tv at the bar. What a legend she was. As I glanced around the restaurant I couldn't help but be taken aback by it's simplistic beauty. It didn't feel like I was back in Athens or Mykonos, but it was nice feeling. The bartender who took care of me was very lovely as well.",0
"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. I was looking forward to trying authentic Sichuan food, but unfortunately it wasn't that great. The flavor was bland and the sauce was too sweet. I don't think I'd recommend it.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay but not great. The happy hour (5-7pm) is definitely worth it, though, as you can get some really cheap sushi rolls and apps. However, the restaurant itself is not really that great, especially given all the great sushi options in NYC. The service was fine, but a little pushy at times. Overall, it's not a bad place to go for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it.",1
"Spanish diner is a great restaurant for a romantic night out. The retractable walls make it perfect for outdoor dining in nice weather, and the electronic ordering and payment is a great concept. We ordered the following: a pan con tomate, jamón serrano, queso manchego, and albondigas con tomate y patatas fritas. Both the pan con tomate and the albondigas con tomate y patatas fritas were delicious. The meatballs were falling off the bone, and the chicken stewed in caramelized onions and sherry wine was also very tender. We also enjoyed the Spanish flan with whip creme. Overall, we had a great dinner at Spanish diner and would definitely recommend it.",1
"I had a great time at Barn Joo 35! The food was really good and the drinks were perfect. I especially enjoyed all the sushi dishes, they were all really tasty and really fresh. The old fashioned cocktail was really good too. The vibe and ambience of the place was really cool and I enjoyed spending time there. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a fun night out!",1
"I was really looking forward to my 1.5 hour bottomless brunch at Toloache Thompson, but unfortunately my experience wasn't as great as I had hoped. The guacamole was delicious, but the rest of the brunch left a lot to be desired. The dishes looked like they may have been made with mystery meat, and the service was pretty slow. Overall, it wasn't a very enjoyable experience.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The Korean bbq was really good, and the waiter was very attentive. The only downside was that the banchan wasn't very good. Overall, a great experience.",1
"I had a really good time at Georgian House. The drinks were good and I loved the cider. The appetizers were especially good and I especially liked the eggplant dip. The lamb soup was also really good. I thought the honey cake dessert was a bit too sweet, but overall I had a great time at Georgian House. The service was also great.",1
I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The food wasn't very good and it didn't really taste Mexican at all. I don't think I would recommend this place to anyone. The only thing that makes it worth two stars is the atmosphere.,1
"Still love this place! I will say I popped in for brunch on a Sunday and was expecting a high energy brunch and was surprised with how chill everything was. That's ok, we still had a great time!I was able to try a few more items on the menu:-chicken skewers: these were delicious and both sweet and savory, perfectly cooked- mini arepas: these were DELICIOUS and I love their cute size, probably my favorite new thing I had tried this go-around- avocado/ tuna ceviche: super saucey and extra delicious. We thought we would need chips with this, but it was perfect on its own! - Calamari: this was perfectly crispy/crunchy, it was the biggest portion we had seen and I was super happy with itService was a bit slow, we had to wave down our server a few times, but it looked like she had a big section. She was very nice.I'll continue to come back! 4.7/5",0
"Meh. We sat at the bar for lunch to avoid the 30 minute wait for a table. Our bartender was new, but friendly...so...We started with appys...shrimp cocktail was very good but not much cocktail sauce. Tuna tartare tacos were good, but not great.Arugula salad had a dressing that made your mouth pucker... Salmon over chopped salad bad a nice dressing, but salmon was dry and overcooked. 2 burgers, one was perfect and the other...eh. Fries were delicious. Overall a great time, but maybe stick to bar food...",0
"I had a great time at Beach Cafe! The brunch menu is great and the prices are reasonable. The only downside is that the ratchet on the smaller side. The Cobb salad is really good though and worth getting outside of the special. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Love this place. Always packed.The spicy Margarita is so good. I love to sit by the bar. I feel like my drink order service is faster!  The nachos are delicious, I  add beef brisket, the rice bowls are great too. Can't go wrong w anything here. Service is super friendly n courteous. Happy hour is M-F 3to 6pm.",0
"This is such a good spot to come with friends and order different items off the dim sum menu. It lets you try a lot of different dishes, so my friend and I got 4 different menu items to try. We ended up finishing all of it and feeling really full after.This is ranked in order of my most favorite to least favorite, but overall, every dish was good and I would get each one again.-Pork and thousand year old egg congee: This was so yummy and reminded me of my childhood eating this for breakfast. The thousand year old egg was cut up really small (would've wished to have bigger chunks), but it was so warm and full of flavor from salty pork. Then they had some kind of sweet soy sauce and chili oil on the side that was yummy adding into the congee.-Soup dumplings: These weren't the best soup dumplings I've had in the city, but they are really really good. I don't have any complaints about these, the wrapper was pretty thin and held up well without ripping. The dumplings came with a lot of soup inside and a good portion of meat.-Sticky rice with lotus leaf: This was cooked really well where the rice was soft and sticky, and the meat inside was fatty and flavorful. There was a generous amount of meat filling and the rice itself had some flavor too.-Pan fried tiny buns: This I was pretty excited about, but the dish came out different from what I expected. Traditionally, these have a really crispy top or bottom and a little bit of soup inside. Even though it looked like they had fried the top of these, they weren't crispy. The inside didn't have any soup which was okay because not all of them do. The meat was pretty good and had veggies mixed in.Service: We were seated right when we got there and the wait staff was really quick with taking our order, bringing out the food, clearing the table, and bringing our check. It was really efficient!",0
"I love the chili ramen at this restaurant! It's really delicious and the delivery is really well done, too. However, I don't really care for the hand rolls. They're way too packed with rice and they're just too big for my taste. I'd order the ramen and that's all I'd ever order from here.",1
"Might be a chain, but the quality and consistency are there, so I'm a fan! The prices are good, the staff is friendly, and the tables are well spaced. They have good deals you can take advantage on via the app as well. The combos can be worth it depending on what you're looking for, but we usually get individual items because we're not interested in the rice, miso soup, etc. Everything is well seasoned and you get to cook it yourself! Because of COVID a lot of kbbq places cook it for you which I don't really like; half the reason I'm there is the joy of cooking and taking time to talk with table mates-- so I love that at Gyu-Kaku you still get to grill the food yourself. Highly recommend! :)",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was really good and reasonably priced. I especially recommend the dan dan noodles, garlic eggplant and the fried rice. The only downside was that it took a while for us to be seated even though the restaurant was pretty empty.",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at The Smith. However, there were a few awkward moments that I think could be avoided. I think it would be helpful if the staff were more communicative when they came to the table with food, since it made it difficult to carry on a conversation. Overall, though, the food was good and I would recommend the restaurant to others.",1
"The duck larb appetizer was a great start to the meal. The duck was shredded rather than ground, which gave it a nice texture. The citrusy spicy sauce was a great addition. The drunken noodle was also delicious. The shrimp with ginger was a nice touch, and it was delicate and tasty. Overall, a great meal.",1
"Jeju is a restaurant with a Michelin star, and it's well-deserved. The food is amazing, and the service is impeccable. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it. The tuna dish is a must-try, and the truffle dish is out of this world.",1
"I had a really great time at nonono! The chicken ramen was amazing - it had a really unique and tasty take on the ramen genre, and the yakitori was also really good. The service was great, and the atmosphere was really cozy and inviting. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Japanese meal.",1
"This review is for takeout only! Went when they had the 32% off grand opening promotion. Food: - Mapo Tofu with Pork: Solid version of this classic! - Dry Pot with Beef: Not as good as some of the other dry pot places in the city. I prefer the thinly cut beef slices for this dish whereas they used the same kind of beef cut you would see in beef and broccoli - White rice: I'm not sure if it was just a bad batch of white rice, but the texture was completely wrong Service/Ambiance: I ordered takeout in person at the restaurant, and the place seemed nice on the inside. No outdoor dining available. The staff was very friendly and answered all the questions I had. Overall: I would like to give it a higher rating, but the white rice texture really threw me off. The grand opening promotion with the 32% discount though was great!",0
Food was good but nickle and dimed us for small things. Like a nonalcoholic drink (lemonade with club soda) was 8 bucks....kinda pricy considering that's a beer or wine somewhere else. Also charged extra when I asked for eel sauce and didn't mention it until I got the bill. Staff wasn't super attentive. So many other sushi places in the area-I'd probably try a different one before coming back here.,0
This place has the best papaya salad. It's extra spicy and the the papaya strips are fresh and crispy  I can't get enough of the papaya salad here. They also have lunch specials for $12 fried chicken sticky rice and a small papaya salad. I been here many times and they ever disappointed me. Service is good and food comes out fast.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The roasted chicken was juicy and tender, and the potatoes were nicely seasoned. I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was all very fresh and cooked perfectly, and the service was great. The only downside was that the Mac and cheese was a bit dry and lacked the creamy/cheesy version I've had in the past. I would definitely recommend ordering more than 1 crab cake if you don't want to share, and the non-steak/beef options are perfect for those who don't eat beef.",1
"Llama San is a great place to go for a casual meal. The scallop, hamachi, tuna, aged duck breast, and iberico pork were all delicious. The only downside was that the plates were quite flat, which made it difficult to pick up the food. The water was also splashing all over the place, which was a bit of a nuisance. However, the restaurant was generally clean and the waitress was polite.",1
"Found on Yelp of course... Popped in this place for quick after work ""happy hour"" fun... but there wasn't any happy hour available, just regular priced drinks. The place is located at the roof top of a hotel: you have to walk through the lobby and take the elevator up to the 16th floor. The food was good and fresh, the drinks were nice and strong-- one drink was good enough for me! The only reason I take away one star is because of the crowdedness: this is clearly a spot for ""after work things"" and it gets super packed. When we first got there, we stood around for about 10 minutes feeling a bit hopeless about getting a table. Luckily two bar stools freed up and we were able to sit at the bar. So if you're planning on visiting, I'd say go early so that you can avoid the 5pm traffic (of people).",0
Nice outdoor seating option and I enjoyed everything I had.  The cheese plate looked beautiful.  Pan with tomato was really good.  Salad with toasted hazelnuts and broccoli tapas were really good.  The churros was just okay - they didn't taste super fresh - but I definitely finished all of them anyway :) I'd come back.,0
"We ordered delivery from Sushi Spot and we were really impressed! There are so many great options on the sushi menu, but we decided to go with some of our favorites: spicy tuna, Philadelphia, Spicy snow crab and shrimp tempura. We also added in an appetizer: gyoza pan pork dumplings. Everything tasted fresh and portions were plentiful. Prices were a bit high, but in comparison to other spots, it's definitely worth it. We would definitely recommend Sushi Spot to others!",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The only downside is that the menu is a bit limited, but the happy hour specials are definitely worth checking out. I would definitely come back here.",1
"I was excited to try HK Cafe in Chinatown, and I was not disappointed. The prices are reasonable for the area, and the breakfast dishes are especially filling, especially after the milk tea. The satay vemicili was delicious, and the meat had a good satay taste. The soup was nice. We managed to seat immediately, but there was a wait when we left (after 10 on a Sunday morning). I would definitely recommend HK Cafe to anyone looking for a good breakfast spot in Chinatown.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The fish crudo was really off, and the sever was nice but it didn't help the food overall. The lobster pasta was also rubbery and didn't taste of lobster. The short rib pasta was the best dish though, and it was a nice surprise. I don't think this restaurant is worth the hype, and I wouldn't recommend it.",1
"I'm not sure if I was just unlucky or if this restaurant isn't as great as it seems, but I didn't enjoy my meal at Blue Ribbon as much as I thought I would. The chicken was dry and lacked flavor, and the service was pretty slow. I don't think this is a place I'd recommend to anyone.",1
"Went there on a Sunday morning. Had a wait time of 5 mins and service was excellent. We got promptly seated. Ordered a English breakfast, got an earl grey tea bag already in my water so did not say anything. Also because I love both teas. Ordered the nova Benny. Poached eggs- perfectly done Which Im Not going to take for granted just because it's a good place. Smoked salmon- beautiful :) I was a tad disappointed with the potato pancakes which were hard and seemed old and re-heated. Bummer because I was really looking forward to them.Also disappointed with the cappuccino :( In a nutshell did have good food not great and don't think I going to go back though.",0
I would rate Mimi Cheng's three and a half stars.We ordered the cacio e Pepe dumplings for takeout. These were pot sticker type dumplings filled with pasta and cheese. The texture of the cheese was very prominent when bitting into the dumpling. Each bite is an explosion of cheese. I didn't realize there was pasta inside until I bit half a dumpling and survey the inside. The dumpling tasted good but I think a different style dumpling that is smaller with less cheese would yield a better texture and mouthfeel when eating the dumplings. The dumplings came with a delicious sauce.,0
Tastes good but lots of rice. Croquettes were delicious. Flavor was great. Went on a Saturday with no wait.,0
"This is just a ""thank you"" shoutout to the owners and staff. Thank you for surviving the pandemic. Thank you for treating us like family. Thank you for great food at fair prices. Thank you for your wonderful braised lamb shank. Thank you for great ""people watching"" from the outdoor patio.Thank you for just being here.",0
"I've been to Capital Grille many times and have always had good experiences but this last time was great. We came here during lunch on a very, very cold day. It was actually nice having the restaurant not be so crowded. The servers and waitstaff were attentive, the drinks were great and the food was better than I remembered.  NY Strips aren't my favorite cut of steaks, but this one had a great taste. The lobster tail add on was the cherry on top. Do yourself a favor, and treat yourself to a lunch here if you find the time.",0
"The wait felt long as it was extremely cold out (~35min) since they do not take reservations on the weekends. But the line moved relatively quickly after group conversations and laughter. Gotta love New York! The level of service is phenomenal - the waiter went above and beyond to ensure that we were catered to. The food was scrumptious from the fried chicken to the fluffy pancakes. Our party ordered different dishes so we were able to sample it all from the grits, pancakes, omelets, potatoes, crispy bacon and fried chicken. The servings were huge that we all did not have any room for dessert. The cocoa drink is a must try - so good!!!!!!  The waiter found out that we were visiting and insisted to take a group picture in the front of the restaurant for a keepscake ( super sweet gesture). Definitely recommend for brunch as they will not disappoint!!!!",0
"This is a good place to have late night food and drinks, but I wouldn't go back just to eat. We got there about 7:30 on a Friday, and had about a 20 minute wait. We got a buzzer and went down the stairs to wait on the street (there isn't much space to wait inside). When our buzzer went off, we went up the stairs again and our table wasn't actually ready so we waited awkwardly next to a table (there weren't any chairs to sit and wait). Eventually we were seated and had seafood pancake and army stew. Both were ok. The army stew is usually an eclectic dish but especially so this time with soggy elbow pasta in abundance. Ambiance was ok, many people around us got watermelon or pineapple filled with soju which looked good. However, there was only one stall in the women's bathroom and the restaurant was loud, hot, and dark. Would only recommend for late night munchies.",0
"This place was pretty good! 2.5 hour wait inline; but the bar was wide open! I came with a friend on a break between Harry Potter play 1 and 2. We split a burger, eggrolls and apple desert. The burger was good! Very tasty! It came out quickly and was cooked correctly.  The egg rolls, were not very good. The apple desert with ice cream was very good flavor and not overly sweet. Our bartender/server was awesome starting off, but quickly lost interest with us. He would ask if I wanted another drink and I would say yes, then he would forgot. I would wave him down to ask where it is, and he would keep taking other people's drinks on the other side of the bar. Eventually I just asked for the check, and low and behold he remembered to charge me and then make the drink after I asked for the check. Overall, the HardRock cafe is cute with the store front (had to grab a tee for family). The music they have is very ROCK and it was fun watching the old music video's. The burger was really good and so was the desert.",0
"I wasn't a fan of Persepolis's prix fixe lunch; I found the appetizers to be unappetizing. However, the la carte options were much better, with my favorite being the falafel salad. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it as much as the other restaurants in the area; three stars, all the way.",1
"My partner and I found ourselves at Two Boots searching for vegan food after working up an appetite during a fun night out dancing at the Stonewall Inn.There were not one but THREE vegan pizza options tho choose from. While they're apparently known for The Marsha, a vegan slice featuring a rainbow of pestos, we ended up getting the Vegan Cleo and V for Vegan because they had more veggies on them.The Cleo was vegan sausage, roasted peppers, red onions & Daiya non-dairy cheese. V for Vegan was a colorful mix of artichokes, red onions, shiitake mushrooms, sweet red pepper pesto, basil pesto & Daiya non-dairy cheese.This was our first taste of New York City pizza and it did NOT disappoint. If we had more than a couple days and a smaller list of other places to try, we'd have come back for more.Not just drunk food--Two Boots pizza would be great any time of day.",0
"Checked out this new restaurant a few days ago with a group of friends. I love how they designed the interior, the fireplace is super cute! The staff were all very nice and accommodating. We ordered a bunch of things, some items that really stood out to me were the lobster avocado salad, lobster Mac and cheese, soft shell crab, oysters from PEI which are my favorite, and of course the seafood. Seafood was really fresh and the sauce was not overpowering unlike some other Cajun restaurants. We picked the 5 pound combo with the boilery sauce and medium spice which was perfect. They also gave us some garlic bread to dip in the sauce omg SO GOOD. We were told that the roasted chicken is a huge hit as well, I definitely will be back to try that. Also the drinks here are phenomenal!!",0
"Always wanted to try this spot and today it finally happened...i tried a califirnia roll and a spicy crab roll..it was fresh and oh soo good...added some spicy mayo, even better. I would recommend it for a light lunch. A plus is that my spicy crab roll came in a pouch that kept the seaweed  fresh for when i was ready to eat it. The place was small but its a grab your roll and go kind of place.  Good food at good prices.",0
"I've had my fair share of Indian food, spanning many cities. I must say that I was very disappointed with this place. The chicken tikka masala was very creamy, but otherwise, it lacked flavor and seasoning. I would even dare say that I would rather have the frozen option at Trader Joe's for both the taste and the value than get it from here again. The tandoori chicken was moist, but had a very similar problem as the chicken tikka in terms of the lack of spice.",0
"Was a bit hesitant cause of the other reviews.. but had a great experience here!My friend and I came around 3-4 pm, so it was not too crowded. Service was fast and they were very helpful with grilling. And omg there was so much food. I really tried to get my money's worth but I was already starting to get full after the first round. (I guess I'm losing my touch..)I particularly enjoyed the thinly sliced brisket and the pork belly. The meats were of great quality, and the banchan was plentiful also.Great spot! I'll try to go during lunch or during off-peak hours.",0
"This restaurant is always busy, and the lines out the door are testament to that! The Korean fried chicken is definitely some of the best I've ever had, and the chili and sweet sauce really bring it to life. The pork belly was also decent, but the kimchi that comes with it makes it a dish worth ordering. The Bulgogi hotpot was also a big hit, and I can't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes!",1
We have been living in the neighborhood for so long but somehow missed this gem of a place. It's the perfect blend of home cooked type of food and restaurant food. We tried their gyoza dumplings with the garlic crisps on top. Pretty great. Thin shell and loaded with stuffing.The katsu curry: I tried the fried chicken and the pork. Both are excellent. The curry is very comforting and comes with some carrots too. The meat is nicely fried and is perfect with the curry. Their ramen is excellent. The noodles are thin and just done right (not completely boiled). The broth is soulful and has the right amount of spice. Comes with half an egg and some seaweed and meat.Definitely going back!,0
"Overall, I thought the food was decent. The pasta dish I ordered (Fettuccine Alfredo) wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it was still good. The sauce was a nice mix of creamy and savory, and the peas and artichoke hearts added a nice pop of flavor. The only downside was that the garlic and Parmesan were added gratuitously, which I felt took away from the dish a bit. Otherwise, it was a decent meal on the go.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but it can be improved. The highlight of the meal was definitely the jumbo salt and pepper prawns - they were so delicious! However, some of the dishes were a bit too heavy, with too much sauce. The service was also great, and the restaurant has a really nice garden. Our only complaint was the fried rice - it was a bit too greasy for our taste. Overall, though, we had a good time here.",1
"We got delivery from here twice! We enjoyed the family meal ($35) which has 1/2 galina, 5 pieces entrecosto con linguica, half chicken, five piece ribs and Portuguese chorizo. The combos also come with rice and fries or roasted potatoes. Our favorites are the ribs and chorizo!! Great portion that will fill up two people and maybe even some leftovers. We will definitely order from here a third time for the delicious and well-priced Portuguese bbq!",0
"I really enjoy Anejo for their lunch specials. The food is great and the staff is always friendly. The service is always quick, too. I especially love their Carne Asada Tortas - they're my go-to! If it's Friday, I also like to indulge in a margarita. All in all, Anejo is a great spot for lunch in Hell's Kitchen.",1
"The Connecticut Roll from this restaurant was delicious! The lobster meat was plentiful and the tots helped make the sandwich filling. It's definitely a bit on the pricey side, but it's worth it for a delicious bite. I'll be back for more!",1
I used to come here for lunch all the time at my old job but haven't come back since they moved across the street and upgraded the place. The decor is more modern and sleek. The space is much larger and there's more seating. I ordered my usual order: chicken thigh over brown rice and salad with carrot ginger dressing. The portion was larger than I remembered. I like that it came in a ceramic bowl instead of a cardboard box like they used to do for dining in. The chicken thigh had a good char and the ingredients were fresh. The staff were a bit rude and not too friendly. I was standing there waiting to order and no one acknowledged me whatsoever. I would come back if I'm ever in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.,1
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The service was fantastic and the waitstaff was very attentive. The atmosphere was cozy and the food was delicious. We recommend the Porterhouse steak for a group of 4. It was cooked perfectly and the spices were very flavorful. The Caesar salad and house salad were also very good. The only downside was that the hashbrowns were not very crispy, but overall we had a great experience.",1
"Can someone explain to me why the cabbage and rice and beans at Caribbean places ALWAYS taste so much better the next day?! That said, I'm excited to have Peppas in the neighborhood. Mac and cheese was delicious. Oxtail was perfect. Will have to go back to try the jerk chicken",0
This was my second time dining at Dun Huang's location in the East Village and I was just as satisfied with this experience as I was with my first. Even though it was packed when we arrived we had great food and service throughout our entire time here.Since we assumed that one of the only decent chinese restaurants would be packed on the evening of Christmas we used Yelp's wait list feature to hold a spot for us here. Once we had about five minutes remaining we made our way here from a nearby bar and informed the host. They honored our place in the queue and seated us at a table in their main dining area. Our server quickly gave us water and our menu's to look over.I was pretty hungry so I wanted something that was guaranteed to fill me up. I read a few reviews and ended up choosing the braised beef noodles ($14). Many people stated that it was both flavorful and plentiful in it's portion size. They were not lying! I finished the dish to the very last drop of the broth and was left extremely satisfied.Service here was great too given how busy it was. We were catered to by a variety of servers throughout our time here and when it came time to get the check we were able to flag down any server to grab it for us. If you decide to dine here expect efficient service and quality dishes!,0
"The best delivery we've gotten during quarantine! Got chicken and banana blossom salad, fried chicken laab, papaya salad and the chicken khao soi. Everything was seasoned soo well! The banana blossom salad was the favorite because it was so unique. It's def spicy but even with my mouth burning a bit I couldn't stop eating. The nutty sauce and the crispy shallots....perfection!! The khao soi is packed up really well for delivery the sauce, wet noodles and pickles, and crispy noodles are all in separate containers so nothing gets soggy!! The pickled onions are keyyy in this dish and they give you lots of them. We thought this would be two meals but instead we just completely stuffed ourselves, no regrets!! can't wait to order again and try other dishes but def still getting the banana blossom salad!",1
"An unfulfilling brunch experience. I ordered the Norwegian eggs Benedict with a cup of coffee. The coffee was cold. When I told the waitress, she took it back, never brought me another cup, and put it on the bill. A note on the staff, in addition to this incident, the staff was very inattentive. My only interactions with the staff were to take my order, receive the food, and pay the check.While the eggs Benedict itself was good, the salad that it came with was prepared with wilted lettuce. The minimal wait time to be seated may be an attractive selling point, but look elsewhere for brunch.",0
"Thoroughly surprised at how delicious and filling the Chicken Caesar Salad was! I was afraid it would be bland because it's on the more basic side of salads, but I was pleasantly surprised. The parmesan to salad to chicken ratio was also perfect. The employees were also very kind. One went to grab some utensils for me when they noticed I didn't have any with my order. I'll definitely be back.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The decor is really contemporary but low-key, and the service was generally really friendly. The only downside is that the food wasn't really that great- the hummus, daal, and schnitzel were all safe bets, but the fish mademoiselle (strange, spongy texture and one-note taste) and the steak (overcooked) were definitely not worth trying. The cocktails were hit or miss, but the bar is definitely a cute spot to catch up with a girlfriend over small bites. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this spot!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant during restaurant week! The service was great and the food was tasty. However, I was unfortunate to have a glass piece fall out of my dessert and ruin the whole experience. Aside from that one incident, the food was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time.",1
"2 stars for management, 5 stars for service, 4 stars for food. Came here looking for a last minute brunch spot. It was a confusing and disappointing start, as we were quoted a 10-15min wait over the phone. We get to the restaurant about two min after calling and there is a line out the door. We decide to wait and after an hour, we were finally seated. Another group came in about 30min after us having also been told that it would be a 15min wait even though it was closer to an hour wait. Shame on the restaurant for being unprofessional and just trying to get people in the door in this regard. I get why, but most places are professional enough to give you an accurate wait time. Other than this sad start, once we were seated, our server was very fast and attentive, getting our drinks, apps, and food orders out very quickly and helping to clear dishes throughout. The food was great, although not much to write home about, though I am only speaking to my own order. We got the avocado tartar to start, and I ordered the green juice and egg white scramble. I probably won't be back just because the food wasn't exceptional enough to warrant the other parts of the experience.",0
"We had a great time at Ristorante Rubirosa our second time there. It can be pretty tight in there (not much elbow room), but it's definitely worth the wait. The food is great, and our favorite dish was the buffalo mozzarella. It was melting in our mouths! And their oven Rubirosa Supreme pizza was outstanding!",1
"We've been coming to this restaurant for about 20 years now and it's always been a great spot for Chinese food in Chinatown. The food is always delicious and the prices are great. I always crave for their sesame chicken and egg fried rice (it's usually best when you eat there) and my wife loves the currey beef stew. The noodles are especially good here. One downside is that one of my friends found hair on the siu mai, so that's 1 star off the rating. However, the food, taste and service are all still excellent. I would give them 3 stars on this review.",1
"Quality with a twist. Pace yourself because you'll want to make it to the end of your meal. When you sit down prepare yourself for the trio of warm biscuits (corn, jalapeño, chive) all of which are so satisfying. We had dinner and brunch here but I'll focus on brunch.Deviled eggs were superb and the flavors/textures hit all the right buttons. For the main course we had Norwegian pancakes and my favorite thing, the Double Cheeseburger. The pancakes were rich and salty and sweet with Viking cheese and Nordic berries. With a scoop of whipped cream right on top. I was impressed with the burger because it was just what you want form a classic style burger. No frills or distractions. Meat, cheese, onions, and three pickles. What else would you need but maybe a little dip of ketchup to take it home. Fries weren't anything to talk about but I was already full by that point.The waitress and staff were friendly right from the beginning to end.I would eat this burger any day, very happily.",0
"Always a delicious meal at Philippe! Trendy and upscale vibes with plenty of opportunity people watching. Fun & upbeat music and dark light atmosphere.Arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we indulged in a few cocktails by the bar. The bartenders were stunning & incredibly friendly. Enjoyed several rounds of watermelon mojitos! Food was exceptional! High quality food best served family style. Some stand out dishes include the lobster fried rice, crispy seaweed, all the pecking duck dishes, crispy beef, and Chilean sea bass. Even simple dishes such as the shrimp dumplings and Kung Pao Chicken were special. Seems like you can't go wrong with anything you order! Service was also fantastic! The staff was very attentive, checking in on us throughout the night. I also joked that I received a terrible fortune during dessert, so they brought out new fortune cookies for me! Memorable meal and overall experience. Highly recommend Philippe for a fun night or even a celebration! Reservation is best.",0
"I would say 3.5 out of 5 stars for Set L.E.S. - I saw a photo of a tasty burger from this restaurant somewhere, so we decided to check them out for a brunch. They offers interesting dishes with Asian twist, which I always enjoy. They have a Brunch Special that comes with a choice of Home Fries, Tater Tots or Waffle Fries. It also comes with a choice of a Mimosa, Bloody Mary, Beer or Any Non Alcoholic Beverage too! We got one of their Brunch SETs with Bloody Mary. It was pretty good, strong with a bit of peppery-ness to it.

We ordered SET 4, Bulgogi Burger, with Tater Tots. The Burger was super tasty! The bottom bun got very soggy quickly, but it was soooo tasty we didn't care... just eat it with knife and fork so that your hands get crazy messy.  We also ordered Pat Lafrieda 30 Day Dry Aged Burger, which is not a part of their set brunch menu, so it didn't come with a complimentary drink. It does come with a choice of sides. I went with waffle fries.Burger was juicy, cooked",1
"Ella's is the new hot spot on the block, with plenty of room to spill out onto the sidewalk and delicious European-inspired dishes. I was impressed with how quickly my table was seating after being advised it would be about 40 minutes, and the drinks menu had a great selection of classics. The octopus was a hit with my group, and I can't wait to try the Brussels sprouts next time.",1
"We noticed a sign for the beyond burger outside the hotel.  There was also a menu posted.  The prices overall weren't to bad and the price of the beyond burger was $14 which is comparable to other restaurants where we have ordered the beyond or impossible burger.  We walked in and walked up to an employee that was talking to another employee about going out.  We were not acknowledged, even though we were seen, because when we walked up we were standing next to the employee she was engaging in dialogue with about partying and what she would look good in. My fiancé interrupted her (the person that took our order) and asked her about the beyond burger.  She said it is the the same as the impossible burger which I knew this was not correct.  One is made of soy and the other pea protein.  We placed our order, to include their happy hour special which was the classic margarita, paid and waited for our food.  We were both surprised when our food arrived.  The burger was a slider!  We paid $14 for a slider.  We thought their prices were comparable but there is no comparison between a slider and a burger.  Other than that the food was good, the French fries were shoe string fries which we both enjoyed....haven't had them in ages.  My margarita was very strong, it wasn't good but strong. After paying $14 for a slider, I felt that a strong drink was needed.Restaurant is located in the Dream hotel. The restroom is located on a different floor in the hotel area.  There is an elevator and staircase.  The hotel is beautiful, well maintained and upscale.  The decor is very beautiful, definitely worth a walk to.     Parking......there is a parking garage not to far away, rate is around $10 an hour.  We arrived in the area via the transit line.",0
"Da Tang is a great find for lunch in Midtown Manhattan! The overall quality of the food is excellent, and the portion size is very generous. Today I tried the Lunch special - Mapo Tofu - and it was very tasty. The Mapo Tofu spice level was just fine for me, but I think I'll mention that next time I order. The Lunch special also includes a generous amount of rice and a regular size Wonton soup, which makes it a great value. I've tried this dish before, while visiting China, and Da Tang reminds me of the food I experienced there. Overall, I highly recommend Da Tang for a quick and affordable meal.",1
"The first time I came here for a company event I thought the drinks and food were both delicious. That was about 5 years ago. I've come back again this year a few times for various friend gatherings and leave each time very underwhelmed by the food, drinks and service. For a restaurant that advertises as a rooftop it's very difficult to get rooftop style seatingThe food here is incredibly overpriced. I don't mind spending on a well-made meal with quality ingredients. However the prices at Catch don't line up with that at all. The catch roll is decent but nothing that your local sushi restaurant can't do much better at half the price. The mac n cheese was very pungent and my group didn't like the mix of cheeses used.The drinks are definitely the highlight and each cocktail I've had has been delicious. My advice: stick to drinks if you decide to try Catch.",0
"We always have to stop for pizza when in NYC and this was our choice on our most recent trip. We made the rookie mistake of not making a reservation and they were fully booked, so we couldn't eat there. However, I did find it a little strange that it was at least half empty, but oh well. We ordered take out and ate on the street instead.

It took about 30 minutes for it to be ready. We got a small pizza, half Tie-Dye and half Honey Pie. I love that they let you do half and half! We got the Tie-Dye because it seemed to be the most popular, but I thought the Honey Pie was better. Next time I'd try the Vodka. The small pizza was still pretty big, but with the thin crust my husband and I still finished it. This is a great spot to go for pizza in NYC, just make reservations ahead of time!",1
"I had a great time at Plato! The happy hour is fantastic - half-price beers and wines, which is great because I love to drink. The white sangria was delicious and refreshing, and I would definitely order it again. The cheeseboard was also great, and came with a berry preserve that was amazing. The truffle fries were also delicious, and I loved that they didn't charge us for the hummus and bread - it was just the perfect amount. I'm definitely a fan of Plato, and I can't wait to come back.",1
"Sadly after hearing much hype and waiting an hour and a half for a couple bar seats, I was unimpressed with the pizza here. Tried a Bianca and a Tye Dye but the crust was too thin and crispy cracker like for me. Additionally, I'm not a huge vodka sauce fan so I was disappointed to find that that was what their specialty was but of course had to try anyway to see what I was missing out on. The glass of house red was reasonably priced and I enjoyed that. Next time I would consider trying some of the many other items on the menu outside of the pizza. All looked good and bar service was just fine so another try will likely happen soon.",0
"Pretty standard diner/restaurant. I've ordered breakfast delivery from Wimpy's a few times over the past couple of months. Overall, the food was decent, and the delivery was on point. For a couple of deliveries, the delivery guy made it to my apartment before Grubhub's ETA. For my breakfast orders, I typically bounce between a waffle platter and omelets. Actually, I think Wimpy's is one of the few places in the neighborhood that has waffles on the menu. The menu has a LOT of times so everyone should be able to find something that they will like. Also, the prices are pretty affordable (even with the meager delivery fee of $0.49 and service fee of $1.25). Because of my pleasant experiences so far with Wimpy's, I have a feeling that I will be ordering from them in the future.",0
"Had high expectations for this place but they were sadly dissolved when I ordered shrimp parm but got back to work and found it was chicken! Then after returning they insisted it was shrimp- I tried it, it was no way shrimp! After getting the correct sandwich (they never apologized), it was mediocre. The whole experience was a bit off putting. However I would try again since it was so packed & the portions were generous, I shared the sandwich.",0
"This would be a lovely divey neighborhood izakaya to hang out at if service wasn't so negligent during busy times. We came Saturday at 7 pm, and the bar was pretty much packed. Unfortunately, there was only one bartender/server and one chef. We ordered five different dishes which took nearly 3 hours to all come out. In fact, they forgot about our last two dishes and we needed to remind them about it. The bartender was also very inattentive and did not give us water, and we had to ask twice to be served water. And of course, it wasn't refilled quickly enough. But he was great at asking us if we wanted more sake.Foil baked mushrooms - pretty tasty with enoki and beech mushrooms. I was honestly expecting a more hearty mushroom like shiitake or maitake, but this was fine.tuna tataki - sesame crusted seared tuna, it was not bad.tuna don - this had the same sesame crusted tuna as the tuna tataki, as well as a tuna mayo mix. (For some reason, they forgot to serve us this dish even though the tuna was prepared in the exact same way. Stupid and inefficient and ridiculous.)korean style bbq - The lettuce was fresh, the meat was pretty tasty although rather hastily chopped, so some pieces were appropriately bite-sized but others were overly large.dried grilled squid - a unique dish that looked and tasted like squid french fries with a soy/chili mayo dipping sauce.The food was not bad, and the sake menu is extensive with very educational descriptions, but unfortunately they don't quite have their service shit together and I would not advise coming here during peak hours.",0
"Jing Fong is a classic Chinatown institution that I've been visiting for dim sum, dinner, weddings, corporate events, and galas for decades. The restaurant has recently undergone a transformation serving Americanized Cantonese cuisine with wine and mixed cocktails for brunch aka ""dim sum"" in Asian culture. The prices are reasonable for dim sum and the cart ladies are always very efficient. The restaurant has a huge space and it can get noisy for big events, weddings, galas, and etc. It's a hit or miss with Jing Fong based on my experiences. I dined here in February for a large party over 300+ people and the food wasn't physically appealing or exceptionally tasty. Some of the dishes portions were incredibly small for a table of 8-10 people and tasted warm. Perhaps, the chefs had a difficult time preparing so many dishes for the large number of people there. However, one shouldn't skip on quality especially for an important event. Hence, I give Jing Fong 3.5 stars. The dim sum experience warranted 4 stars.",1
"Jeepney is a restaurant I've heard a lot of reviews from my friends who came here so it's always been on my to-try list. Booked the kamayan night for 4 people, there were multiple emails back and forth with Jeepney staff to make sure our order was correct. A deposit is required, and you can make changes up until 48 hours before the actual day. We booked for 4 people but one of them couldn't make it, we are still required to pay. It was listed on the contract, so we were expecting this.

Food: I opted for the meat lover combo. It came with bone marrow, spare ribs, spring roll, and other types of meats. IT. WAS. ALOT. OF. FOOD. We ended up packing 4 full boxes worth to take home. Overall experience, I would say it's not worth ~$450 for this meal. The meat was just average, nothing they served was on the kamayan night menu was 'exotic' or hard to get as opposed to regular entrees. We were looking at other people's regular dishes and they looked better LOL, so maybe i'll come back for the regular menu but definitely won't be coming back for the kam",1
"Jacob's Pickles is a must-visit brunch spot if you're in the mood for some delicious Southern classics. The fried chicken is perfectly breaded and fried, and the chicken cutlets are probably the size of your face. The corn soup special is a great, under the weather, bone warming soup. The french fries are done well and perfectly crispy. I definitely recommend getting the honey chicken sandwich that comes with cheese grits so you can get a taste of popular food items that Jacob's Pickles has to offer - spicy pickles, biscuits, honey fried chicken, and a side of cheese grits. YUMMY.",1
"This is one of those restaurants that you walk past and theres nobody inside, but the food is actually safe and the service isn't run away from your table worthy. Discovered Casa Mexicana last year and went back recently. Their table side guacamole is unreal. Ask for it spicy if that's your thing. The happy hour is also clutch and super cheap. Like 4 for a beer and 6 for a glass of wine cheap. Had the Burro and it was delicious as always. Don't get me wrong I'm a massive fan of Mexican and know that  you can go to San Diego for great Mexican, but they really care about their food/service here and it shows. Looking forward to going back soon!",0
"Xi'an's Hand Pulled Noodles is a restaurant I've been back to a few times and it has really nailed down the flavors, prep speed, and portions. The flavors are always spicy, always full, and the portions are always reasonable for the price. The go-to orders for me are the lamb cumin hand-pulled noodles (dry or in soup) and the tiger salad (a very simple salad but so refreshing!). And maybe the lamb pancake too, but then I leave a bit too full with minor regrets. Xi'an's is a great value for your eleven dollars in this area. The people are in and out whether it's lunch or dinner, and there are always seats.",1
"I love their braised short rib! It falls off the bone and the spicy sauce on top makes it an important part of the pho. Out of the five things I got (one is the free steamed chicken dumplings, which I do not think I would pay 8$ for but we got for free through checkin so I can't complain) the braised short rib pho is the best and is what makes me want to come back sometime. It is super oily, but I don't even mind it because of how savory it is. I am less struck by the braised short rib bun: same braised rib, but the combo is just less flavorful  We were disappointed by the fish tacos. They aren't bad, but just not that great. The flavors don't come together well. The summer rolls and steamed dumplings I would just not get. The former is dry and bland, and the steamed dumplings taste like the frozen kind you buy from the supermarket. So maybe you should just stray away from the apps. All in all I would come back just to have the braised short rib pho on a cold winter day :)",0
What we ordered: - lychee martini - very traditional and dry!- Kal bi ($30) - tender and yum. Comes with rice and salad and side dishes! Eat everything together and the flavor is perfect. - chicken soup ($22) - you can really taste the real chicken broth made from bones and chicken (rather than store bought chicken broth) - fried chicken - our favorite app! The sesame flavor profile was delicious. - Mandu dumplings - these were only ok! Wish the beef they used was more tender and flavorful. Would be excited to come back when indoor dining opens!! The tables inside are huge and the decor is super modern / elegant.,0
Not really New York style pizza but ok anyway. Similar to pizza I get in St. Louis minus the provel cheese.,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ramen is definitely good, not amazing but good and flavorful. The $10 premium meat can make or break the meal, so I highly recommend it. The solo eating area and fast, courteous service are all wonderful too. You don't get too much ramen for your money but you won't leave hungry. Overall, I would definitely come back!",1
"Long-standing spot that is worth visiting on your Burger trail in NYC. I tried visiting JG last Friday night around 9:00 pm and the lines and crowd around the building were way too long for me so we came back again for an early Saturday dinner (right around 4:45pm) and there was no line and plenty of open tables.Service was friendly and efficient and remember it's cash only. The decor has this watermelon theme that's kinda funky.Now we both tried the classic popular items on the menu - the cheeseburgers (with bacon and extra pickle for me) and cottage fries. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the fries. I'm usually a fan of thin fries and thought these would be too thick and mushy but they were perfectly crisp. The burger was really good, but not what I'd consider great. They keep things simple here so you add your own ketchup, mustard and onion/pickle. I personally like my burgers with some sort of sauce or guac to balance out the bun and meat. So for me this was a little bit dry. I ordered my burger medium and it was cooked with just a bit of pink so the chefs def know what they're doing. I'd go back again and try the chili but wouldn't go out of my way for the burger again.",0
"Ramen in a food court/market is always a bit of a tough proposition.  The space is limited and its hard to get high, consistent quality.  Kuro Obi is a Totto Ramen affiliate so of course, I was expecting something on that level.  Did it get there?  Not really but again, it's hard given the confines of a food court.  The broth here is the biggest weakness - it's a bit weak and even though I got the black belt that had the extra flavoring, it was still too bland.  The noodles were cooked well but the cha siu and other accompaniments were a bit sad.  Eating in a paper bowl also takes away from the overall experience but it's not a bad bowl of ramen.  If I wasn't comparing it to a Totto Ramen experience, I'd be more inclined to find it better but it was just ok for me.Staff here was very friendly.  Prices were what you would expect from a food court in the LES - a tad inflated but not terrible.  Pretty average but it's not bad.",0
"The food here is amazing, but the delivery is not as good. I would recommend at least checking out the restaurant, it's definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the West Village.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but I didn't enjoy the experience of sitting outside in takeaway containers. The service was also lacking, as we didn't receive waters until we were almost done with our meals. Overall, it was a stressful experience.",1
"Love love the lunch special here! You basically get two appetizers (I got spring roll and soup) and entree (I got shrimp pad thai) for a very reasonable price. Being that this is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city, I was super excited to come back here and as expected, was not disappointed by the food and the service. I also tried for the first time lychee Thai iced tea, which I absolutely loved and enjoyed. The outside seating area is comfortable as well and the tables are nicely spread apart. Highly recommend!",0
"Jungsik is a fantastic restaurant with delicious food that everyone will enjoy. The caviar dish was my favourite, but everything I tried was great. The service was wonderful, and the atmosphere was perfect. I would highly recommend Jungsik to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"Los Tacos No. 1 is a great option for delicious tacos in New York. The original Chelsea Market location is always packed, so it's great to see them expanded with multiple locations. The carne asada tacos are my favorite, but their vegetarian options are also good. The Nopale plate is a great option if you're looking for a small savory bite and low carb.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The ingredients are fresh and the food is very well cooked. I was surprised at the healthiness of the bowl. The rice has a Hainanese chicken flavor and it is on POINT. The value is great and I would definitely come here again.,1
"Came here late one night and got a table outside. We ordered a few pitchers of the lychee cocktail which tasted pretty good, but honestly was quite small, especially for the price.",0
I really enjoyed my meal at Nangman BBQ. The Bulgogi burger was delicious and the service was great. The only downside was that the place was quite empty when we arrived. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.,1
"Restaurant week dinner with a friend and had reservations.  Got sat right away and it was a tight squeeze to the table.  They had movable plastic dividers to still allow maximum capacity but it was very tight.  It took a while to get an order in for drinks.  We had to flag someone down after the table next to us that was sat after us had received drinks and we hadn't been greeted.  Once we got drinks in we looked at the regular menu and restaurant week menu and decided to do restaurant week.  We shared all so we got to try various items. Apps - Mediterranean Fried Artichokes - yummy.....Provencal Hummus - super yummy too.  Both good choices. Entree's - Faroe Island Salmon - nice crispy skin and seasoned wonderfully.  Summer Truffle - Ricotta Ravioli - had me at Truffle, one of my favorite flavors in any dish.  Don't recall the dessert and it was light and very tasty.  Didn't leave us disappointed.  The one unusual item was going to the ladies' room.  They are interchangeable restrooms down a small hall with a sink at the end.  The location isn't the best as there is no space for a line, so be aware.  For a second I thought people weren't washing their hands as they'd come out and not use the sink at the end of the area.  Low and behold there are sinks in the rooms as well...sooo glad people have good hygine....or do they?",0
"The Bao is a restaurant that claims to have ""The best soup dumplings in NYC."" I'm not so sure about that, but the dough is thicker than I like and the shumai and har gow are good sizes, but not super satisfying. I didn't have any entrees, so perhaps that's their stronger suit. So, if you're in the East Village and craving dim sum, give this a shot to decide if they have the best soup dumplings in town. Otherwise, keep heading south to Chinatown.",1
"This place is gonna be my go to Izakaya! The vibe is so good and staff there are so friendly. We ordered a bunch of food, cheesy corn, potato croquette, soft shell crab sando, mapo tofu, pork katsu curry. It's enough food for two for two meals. However this is the first time I'm here so I've gotta try as many as I can. Everything we ordered were great. I'll definitely come back for their happy hour!",0
I had a great time at Uncle Ted's modern Chinese restaurant! The atmosphere was bustling and the service was fast and efficient. The food was delicious and I especially enjoyed the cucumber cocktail and lychee tini. The dumpling sampler was also a good choice. I would definitely recommend this place to others.,1
"I have been to Felice on UES and, decided to eat here when I was midtown. Love the ambience.  Food was excellent too. I had the wholewheat penne arrabbiata (they offer wholewheat options for all their pasta!) and a side of cauliflower. Both were delicious. My friend had the salmon and enjoyed it very much. So why three stars? Service was very lackluster and disappointing. They didn't even fill our water glasses; didn't ask if we wanted another glass of wine. They brought my pasta first without the cauliflower and I had to remind them about the cauliflower.",0
"I had to agree with the other person who wrote a review about the $20 for 10 wings being ridiculous. They were fresh and tasty, but the staff wasn't really that attentive. The TV was really loud and it made it difficult to actually have a conversation with anyone. The only good thing about the experience was that there weren't any kids in the bar.",1
"I thought the presentation of the ramen was great and the place was also pretty spacious for a big group. The only downside is the ramen is a bit too salty for my taste, I would ask them to make it less salty. Otherwise solid ramen place in midtown.",1
"I really enjoyed my burrito at this restaurant! The meat was flavorful and juicy, and the protein to carb ratio was perfect. I was a little disappointed with the sauce, though. I thought it was a little too spicy for my taste, but the burrito was still a good size and very filling for its price which was about $13. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"This is really 3 stars but I'm trying to support small businesses during these times. CASH ONLY. I was pretty excited when I saw a boka in chinatown because I loveee korean fried chicken and I have too many fond memories with the boka at st. marks. So we got a combo of wings and fries and a bottle of soju which is such a good deal. I mean 20 wings, yummy fries, and a bottle of soju for $41?! Sign me up. I got half spicy and half soy garlic. The fries were pretty good, thick and soft. The chicken was a little disappointing though because it was really battered up. The skin was not the boka skin I knew of and this was a thick, soggy crunch not like the other super crunchy skin. The kimchi fried rice was pretty good here though! A pretty good portion size and tasty! If they improved their chicken a little more, I would probably be ordering chicken and soju every week.",0
"Gopchang Story BBQ is a great place to get some delicious Korean BBQ. The small intestine, large intestine, and tripe were all really good, but the heart was my favorite. The beef tartare was also really good, and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Meh. Forgettable. The only thing Pera Soho has going for it is the ambiance and location. The food and drinks were weak. I remember Pera from back in the day, their midtown location was our go to restaurant for entertaining out of town visitors or any time we craved good Turkish food. Haven't been to a Pera in awhile, but my brunch experience made it pretty clear that the owner decided to invest more in making it look pretty and less in substance. The brunch menu was in line with pretty much every below average brunch restaurant in NYC. I ordered the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, my friends ordered the chicken shaslik and a bunch of apps and sides. Nothing really jumped out at us as being remarkable. It was just meh. The truffle potatoes were good. The chicken was dry. The Muhamara was alright. The octopus could have used more flavor. The Bloody Mary was meh. The service was great. I don't know.. I wish they would stick to their guns and include more OG menu items. Give the tourists, who are clearly your target audience, something to come back for. Something to write home about. Anyway, avoid if you can. Plenty of scene-y restaurants with actual good food in the neighborhood.",0
"If a pizza place has been in business for over 100 years, they must know what they're doing.  The basic margherita was simple, with thin crust and light cheese that was savory without being overbearing in flavor.  Italian sodas and spritzers were perfect on a super hot day.  The interior walls have exposed brick, ceilings with pressed tin or plaster, making this one charming eatery.  Cash only.",0
"Reliable but food is salty all around. Had marinated bbq, soondubu and japae. Service generally good but food was really salty and priceyAlways have free tables though and you can carry a conversation here without having to yellThat said would come back only if cho dang gol isn't available",0
"The Terrace and Outdoor Gardens is a great spot for drinks and bites. The 7th floor and 8th floor have instagram-worthy outdoor areas, and the indoor bar on 8th is also quite beautiful. Cocktails ($19) and mocktails ($12) were well-prepared, and we ended up dining at the bar on fried chicken croquettes, tuna tartare, shikito pepoers and the huge DIY sundae.

For great views check The Irving On Hudson, but for high-end food and cocktails in otherwise crowded, touristy Time Square, this is a good (albeit expensive) spot.",1
"The waitstaff is very friendly and pleasant, but they're 100% understaffed. The wings were tasty, but that's about where it ends. My fiancé's burger was so dry he had to douse it in ketchup to finish. The patty was extremely thin and clearly poor quality and frozen. The chicken cous cous dish was a JOKE. It was tiny, zero flavor (except butter), and I honestly could've made a tastier meal myself at home. And not for $18! They did comp the chicken cous, because it was clearly not worth it and I didn't eat it. The lights in the back are FAR too bright for a dinner date out. However, the real dud is the food. Won't be returning, unfortunately.",1
"I stopped by this Italian restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is really unique and the drinks are delicious. The menu has a lot of variety, and the portions are just right. The only downside is that some of the dishes require salt, which can be a bit of a distraction. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The space is really cozy and the staff is very friendly. I tried the Mango Lassi and it was really good. It was thick and smooth, and had just the right amount of sweetness. I decided to order the Tandoori Mixed Grill and it was really good. There was a lot of different meats on it, and they all tasted really good. The only downside was that there was only one piece of salmon on it. But overall, I really enjoyed it. I would definitely come back here.",1
"Planta Queen is a vegan restaurant with a unique menu that we wanted to visit. The vibe of the restaurant was very metropolitan and fast-paced, but relaxed all at the same time. We were seated promptly with hardly any wait given our reservation time. The hostess was friendly and the service throughout the night was truly impressive. Between having our waters filled, to plates getting picked up, we felt taken care of.

On to the most important part...food. Between three people, we shared the bites that we ordered. The Bao Slider was pretty good, the mushroom chik'n was different and enjoyable, and the ahi watermelon was the novelty of something being created out of watermelon intrigued me. The ginger was certainly overpowering and all I could think of was pickled sushi ginger. Glad I tried it, but would not order it again.

The dragon roll was the star of our orders! We all really enjoyed this, though the tempura was not evident whatsoever. Made us wish we ordered more rolls. The won ton soup was I enjoyed the bits of ginger, but the overuse of sesame oil was not cutting it for me. The won tons lacked flavor, which made this dish miss the overall mark.",1
"I had a great time at Crop Circle! The food was outstanding and the service was great. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy, so it was difficult to get a table. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"The ramen at this restaurant was really good. The broth was rich and flavorful, and I really liked the soft and chewy texture of the wavy noodles. As someone who likes spicy foods, I really liked the option to add chili oil to the ramen. The chili oil was pretty good. It tasted especially good in the chili oil mayo sauce that came with the truffle fries.

Overall, I thought the ramen was a good value and I would recommend it to others. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit small, so it may not be ideal if you're looking for a quiet meal.",1
"The food was decent but not the best I've had, and the prices were alright. The atmosphere was nice and the service was good. The only downside was that the AC was broken and it was really warm in the restaurant. The staff did offer to move us to another table, but they were a little pushy about it. Overall, it's a decent place to eat at.",1
"Always a long waitSo make sure you come early if you canWe already came here for many timesGreat taste and great qualityAlways order stir fried cabbage , beef sour soup, and la-zi chicken!",0
"I was not really impressed with my recent experience at The Edge Restaurant. The ratings seem to be quite positive, but that may be because the restaurant's main draw is its stunning views of the cityscape. While the food may not be as great as people may expect, I would definitely recommend checking out the restaurant's appetizer menu if you're in the mood for some delicious bites. Additionally, the restaurant took quite a while to serve our food, which was not at all consistent with its high-end status. Overall, I would only recommend this establishment to those looking to spend a romantic evening overlooking the cityscape, or for those who enjoy spending a bit more time waiting for their food.",1
"The edamame pancake was sweet. The flavour was pretty interesting. For the friend chicken, some of the balls didn't have chicken inside and we asked our server and she said it's supposed to be like that. Not all of the fried balls come with chicken. The hotpot came with fluke and some bean sprouts. Fish was very fresh. Everything was good but we would rather try something else than going back again. (PS - we didn't make a reservation and was told to wait for 30 mins but there were 2 empty tables in front of us and the tables were still empty by the time we finished food hmm lol) The host was friendly btw.",0
"I had a great time at Planta Queen! The extensive menu had something for everyone, and the fun ambience was perfect. I loved the coconut ceviche and the crispy rice with watermelon, and the truffle potato dumplings were also very good. The only thing that knocked off a star for me was the seating. We made an advance reservation but there was no table ready for us on arrival. We were relegated to the table right by the host area, which meant we were perpetually surrounded by a queue of folks waiting for seating. We did ask to be moved but were told no other tables were available (though there were other empty tables). It made conversation a little challenging. However, the team at Planta Queen did comp a dessert at the end to help remedy this. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely come back.",1
"I stopped in at Killer Bee Pizza for a quick pizza dinner and was very pleased with the experience. The staff was quick and efficient, and my pizza arrived quickly. The pizza was delicious, with a nice char on the crust and plenty of toppings. It was a bit more expensive than I'm used to paying for pizza, but it was definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend Killer Bee Pizza to others.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is really cozy and inviting. The bathrooms are always clean, and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. I always enjoy coming here with my family. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high, but overall it's definitely worth it!",1
"Personally rating it a (3/5) mostly for the dish I ordered & my preferences. Overall place isn't bad, prices are average, can be worth checking out perhaps. --I ordered the green curry, and it had a few things that I wasn't super happy about:1. The ""eggplant"" that the menu indicated it would have seemed to be pretty undercooked and was more like a crunchy cucumber-zucchini with a lot of seeds. I'm more used to the very soft, tender eggplant that's stewed in curry & oils with lots of flavor. I was disappointed in this aspect of the dish, esp as I was looking forward to it. It's possible this is another style of eggplant in thai curry I haven't experienced before, but just to let people know if you expected the same thing as me. 2. The curries indicated that it ""came with rice"", which I found deceiving as it didn't mention that the rice would still cost the extra $2.5 that was listed under the sides. I would've ordered rice anyways bc it's curry, but would have been nice to have that be more clear instead of phrasing it in a way that seemed like it was included in the original menu price. 3. The green curry was spicier than I expected, which again I wish was something the menu or servers had mentioned beforehand. Usually with dishes like this, you have the option of customizing your spice tolerance, and unfortunately I didn't get this option and it was just a tad bit too spicy for my preference. 4. The curry base itself was pretty average; nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. Overall, not super happy about my dish I got here (I've gotten better thai curry elsewhere), but if these things don't bother you then you might end up liking it better than me!",0
"I thought this restaurant was alright. You come in, order from a touchscreen, and pick up your food from a kiosk when it's ready. The food was good, but I wasn't a fan of the thick and tough skin and size of each dumpling. I'm sorry, but I wanted to like this place more. I'll definitely come back to try other flavors that I might enjoy.",1
"TERRIBLE SERVICE! I've been here for late night drinks before and didn't have a problem, but my roommate and I got here for brunch one Sunday and asked for a table outside since the weather was nice (a little windy but the sun was out). We were pointed to a table and as we walked to the table, the wind blows a napkin off one of the tables and the wait staff points to the napkin telling my roommate to pick it up. It wasn't even our table!Then we sat and waited at least 20-25 mins without any service. Nobody came by with water or to take our order and the restaurant was pretty empty. We eventually just got up and walked across the street to Good Enough To Eat where they had amazing service.",0
We order here all the time and I'm finally making a review but I need to start taking a pic of my food before we dive into it lol! Always always on the list is their hand made quesadillas. They are fresh and delicious. Chicken is my fav and my husband loves the steak. My kids always get the chicken fajitas and it comes with a lot of food. Happy to have found this place,0
"The shop is most likely super delicious in person - but my delivery order was disappointing. I ordered the crispy fillet of sole bang mi and vegetarian broth soup. Soup was fantastic! Held up well and very tasty/ filling. The sandwich fell flat being soggy, no crisp in sight, and too mayo-driven. The bread also didn't taste great and was falling apart / dry. It may have been an off day or a delivery issue but other places have traveled better. I'll probably order the soup again!",1
"I came here on a Friday night with the girlfriends and it wasn't hard to get a reservation but the place was popping! We all agreed that this would be our new fave casual spot to grab dinner and drinks because the food was delish and the drinks weren't too pricey ($13$-15). We all loved the Mac n cheese & the nachos with steak added, the nachos were incredible!!! The portions were great and everything could be shared. For my entree, I got the branzino and I could go there every day to eat this meal - it was that good!",0
"Fancy pricey a la carte hot pot. Great service! We stopped in on a summer Tuesday and got seated right away in the back area (slightly upstairs with 3 screens playing music videos or concerts). You are certainly paying premium for the service, fresh ingredients and ambiance compared to AYCE hot pot in the area. We started with mushroom and beef bone broth, which are for individual pots. They don't have the standard sauces like bbq, but rather provide a set of 6 ingredients: sesame, soy sauce, xo sauce, cilantro, green onions and hot peppers. The Spicy Sichuan Skewers were pretty tasty if you enjoy intestine (new menu has beef cubes removed). The beef tongue was thinly sliced. Flavor do the soup was ok, nothing special. Highlight was the home made fish paste and fried pork, which you can eat on its own or cook in your soup.Be sure to get a plum juice to cut the sodium. 2 of us spent about $75 each with tip, which is more than I would normally spend on hot pot but enjoyed the fancy experience.",0
"Malai Marke is a very enjoyable Indian restaurant on a Side street in the Lower East Side.  There is still no inside dining, so I just sat outside in the little café they had set up.They have a number of glasses of house wine, but I also noticed that they have Indian beers. I ordered Kingfisher, and I was pleasantly surprised how they served it nicely in a chilled Pilsner glass.The food itself is delicious. I am not an expert at Indian food, so I can't get into it too much. But I found the sauce on the lamb to be really delicious. When I cook at home I cannot make my sauces like that!  I can't be certain, but I think the lamb might have been previously frozen.The service itself was very dignified. I really felt like I was being treated with respect.The only negative, and it was a slight one, was that the rice was not included, and it was actually relatively expensive. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. The prices for the other items were reasonable. But then I realized I was there for a late lunch or maybe early dinner on a weekday, so no lunch menu was presented to me.",0
"I had a good time at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really cool and the food is good, too. Sometimes I think it's a bit pricey, but then again, it's in a pretty good neighborhood. The service is alright when it's really busy, but when it's not, they give you a lot of attention.",1
This is a tiny place great for takeaway. Everything is really fresh and Well portioned. I tried the bulgogi and galbi and both were really delicious! This is now a regular for me for lunch.,0
"Overall, Abacky is a decent restaurant with good prices and a clean and decent looking interior. The food is not authentic tasting for their Thai or Japanese offerings, but it is still edible. The prices are very reasonable too for Chelsea.",1
"Let me start by saying that I am not vegan and I've tried a few vegan restaurants in the past and did not really like the food. However, a friend recommended jajaja so I decided to give it another shot. The food was a lot better than the other vegan spots that I've tried in the past and was pretty decent! I really enjoyed the cauliflower tacos. I thought the nachos and chorizo burrito were fine but didn't blow my mind. The ""meat"" definitely did taste like actual meat which was really impressive.  Drinks were very pretty but weren't the best flavor wise. I give it 3 stars because the food was decent and the best vegan food I've tried yet, however, customer service was not great. We had 4 different people rotate every couple of minutes to ask us if we were finished with our food even though we clearly were not and was still working on it. I guess they were in a rush to kick us out? I understand that some restaurants now have time restrictions but they did not make that clear to us from the start and instead just kept sending new people to rush us out. We were not even there for that long. It was very uncomfortable and a bad experience.",0
"Food 4/5The kimchi pancake was a little flavorless, but the kimchi fried rice and the mild seafood soup were very heart-warming and satisfying. We didn't order any soju because they were priced quite high, unfortunately. There was something weird in the seafood soup that kind of looked like mini-brains?? But when you bit into it it would pop and liquid would come out and it tasted kind of bitter. Still don't know what they are to this day... Anyway, the menu had so many different dishes I wanted to try them all, so I'll have to come back to try! Interior 5/5Loved the design of the menu, the tall ceilings, and unique lighting were definitely a plus. I really like how the restaurant feels more upscale and serves very good Korean food at the same time. Service 4/5Friendly waiter, not much to say.",0
"Joe's Steam Rice Rolls are my favorite, but Yin Ji comes in a close second. The portions here are much bigger, the meat more plentiful (we're talking one to two pieces of meat per bite. Can you get that at Joe's? Noooo. WILDLY generous people here, although I guess they better be for charge $7-8 for rice noodles that typically cost $3). But. But. The rice noodles are nowhere near as thin. See pictures below. The first layer is transparent but the next few, not so much. Still definitely thinner than your typical dimsum restaurant.

The shrimp and beef rice rolls are my favorite here. The pork rice rolls are okay, but I would skip it next time. Soy sauce is already served drizzled over the noodles, which is normally a good thing because again, super generous with the soy sauce. But. Yep, another but! But their sauce is on the sweeter spectrum. Soo. Not a big fan.",1
"Needed a last minute Friday night dinner reservation for four and we some how ended up here. Highly popular for their cocktails and cute glasses but everything kind of fell short of our expectations that night. We started off with cocktails in which our server told us certain glasses were stolen so they won't be served like how they are displayed on the menu. Service was quite slow, we were left sitting with empty glasses and no food for awhile until we flagged down our server who was busy running back forth inside and outside to the outdoor dining setup. At one point, my boyfriend wanted to just walk over to the bar to order a drink. Once the food order was in, things came out pretty quick. We had the baked Camembert and oysters to start, we finished these and our drinks a good while before we were able to place our dinner order. The oysters were not good considering the price, they were gritty and just thrown on the ice. The dinner came out quick but the steaks were cold. I wanted to take my fries home and they ended up making a fresh order which was nice. Overall, not a great experience. Maybe it was our mistake for coming for dinner, seems like people have a better time for brunch here.",0
"I had a great time at Famous Calabria! The pizza was really good - the crust had just the right amount of crispness and crunch when you bit into it, and the Grandma slice was especially tasty. The place is also brand new, so it's a great place to go if you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy your food. The manager was also nice - he gave me some garlic knots gratis. Overall, I had a great experience at Famous Calabria, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"ABC Cocina is a stunning restaurant with delicious food. I had a great experience there, and can't wait to go back! The service was phenomenal, and the food was excellent. The guacamole and mushroom tacos were my favorite, but everything I tried was delicious. The only drawback was that some of the dishes weren't quite as great as others. Overall, I had a great time and would highly recommend ABC Cocina to anyone looking for a delicious brunch in a lovely setting.",1
"From the outside Manting doesn't look all that impressive. The food bar line makes it seem like a cheap take out location-however, I was very surprised to find that the food was actually very delicious and had such a great dinner experience. I came by with a friend on a Friday night around 7 PM and the place was packed but thankfully getting seats was pretty easy. We were sat down and handed our drinks. Afterwards, we went up to the line to pick out our ingredients for the dry hot pot. The server was very sweet and explained the whole process as well as answered any questions about the ingredients we may have had. Then we were told to sit back down and had our dish brought over. The food was absolutely delicious, there was definitely enough flavor even though I only picked the mild spice level. It went well with rice and even held up well the next day. In addition to the dry hot pot, we also ordered a beef Malatang as per the suggestion of the waitress. The ingredients used were basically the same as the ingredients for the dry hot pot therefore if you get either the dry hot pot or the malatang I wouldn't recommend you get both at the same time. Just figure out if you want a soup based or dry dish. I do think the dry hot pot was better though just because it had a stronger flavor. All in all, a surprisingly good restaurant with wonderful staff-definitely something that should be tried out if you are in the area!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The pho was great and the banh mi was really good. The only downside is that it's a bit on the expensive side. But overall, it's a great spot for quick and easy Vietnamese food.",1
"Osteria Morini is yet another spot for fine Italian dining in manhattan.To be fair, I give it 3.5 stars.The pasta here is excellent. They are freshly made with delectable flavors. The signature pasta here is the cappelletti, which does not disappoint.With that being said, everything else I found was not as impressive. The appetizers that we tried were fine, but not very memorable. For the cocktails, I'd say the same.Overall, great pasta, but expensive with portions on the smaller side. I would definitely come back, but it probably wouldn't be the first place that came to mind if I was craving Italian- especially in a city where the competition is high.",0
I love this place so much! Xiao Long Bao is great and Dong Po Pork is amazing too. I highly recommend which you can get a real Shanghai food experience,0
Broth is delicious for both the chicken paitan and the tonkotsu.... Not really a fan of the noodles tho- it feels like soba noodles took a dip in the wrong broth. These noodles don't really take up the flavor of the broth and are a bit harsh on the taste buds. Takoyaki was so good- possibly the best I've had in nyc. Chicken karaage was average...big pieces of chicken meat but not crispy enough. Huge portions. Excellent service. They don't have their alcohol license yet so it's BYOB.,0
"This place is great for quick and easy lunches. The food is decent, but nothing to write home about. The service is friendly and efficient, which is always appreciated. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit small, so it can get crowded. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot if you're in the area.",1
"Mmm, this place was so good! My bf and I ordered 5 hand rolls each and shared two appetizers: the calamari and the furikake fries. The calamari was delicious and it was not the usual calamari you have at Italian restaurants. It came with 5 big pieces of squid that seemed beer battered and was lightly crispy! The furikake fries were like coin chips and was not greasy/oily at all! Both appetizers had a nice pairing of unique sauces like tomato tonkatsu sauce. As for the hand rolls, my favorite was the xo scallop and the toro hand roll! All the hand rolls are pre seasoned and delivered by the sushi chef in front of you at the bar. We even got to talk to Alex, our sushi chef! Each hand roll will have soy sauce, wasabi or sriracha in it. They make sure to pair whatever sauce nicely to the fish. My bf really enjoyed the uni hand roll which was at market price. There were 3 types: from Maine, from Santa Barbara and from Hokkaido Japan, with the latter being the most expensive at $34. He got the Santa Barbara uni and thought it was delicious and super buttery! I would choose to go to this place over Kazunori even though it's a bit more expensive. The vibe and interior is nice and clean. The host will check your vaccination card upon arrival so make sure you have it! If you show only a picture of the card, they will ask for photo ID. I felt confident in my safety there especially since we sat with other parties pretty closely at the sushi bar. Highly recommend!",0
"I recently visited Blue Ribbon and overall I had a good experience. The food was good, but I wasn't blown away like I usually am when eating fried chicken. The coating on the chicken was a little too thick for my taste, but it was still crispy and well seasoned. The fries were also decent. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good chicken meal, but I would recommend going elsewhere if you're looking for something more unique or upscale.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The service was always good and the air conditioning was a lifesaver. The bowl option with a protein, two fill-its, fluffy pita, and choice of toppings and sauces is so worth it. I was stuffed after eating this. Honestly, I should have eaten half and took the rest home. I was hangry! The music was also great - Soundgarden, STP, Foo Fighters. I didn't want to leave.",1
"I walked into Rubirosa not really expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. It is a small space but quite cozy. I managed to snag a seat at the bar and ordered a pizza and margarita. The pizza was great, not the best I've had but certainly still delicious. At first I was disappointed in my $15 margarita on the rocks. But let me tell you, it had plenty of tequila! I did notice other diners ordering pasta so maybe that's worth trying as well. The bartenders were all equally nice and I really did enjoy my meal here!",1
"Heard so much about this place from so many people that felt compelled to go...We got a table inside right away which was very nice.. the hostess was very kindWe ordered Lamb Tagine, Sautéed Shrimp, Vegetable Couscous, Sausage and Couscous...We also got some Pita and Hummus including a plate full of pickled red tomato and garlic which was deliciousThe vegetable couscous was ok, couldn't taste the Zataar spice, veey mellow notesThe lamb was flavorful but not spicyShrimp was on pointAfter serving us drinks and when out food came, which was quite late, the person attending to our table never came back to ask if we needed anything like water or ...Found out about a very cool place not too far away from here called Kubeh, will head there next.... Won't be coming back here...",0
"I can't believe I never wrote a review sooner especially when my own little brother was the assistant manager there before (before Covid) LOLSpot is always delicious!~ Has great awesome yummy creations and lounge spot, they even opened a second shop awhile ago. 

I come here with my cousin & friends once in awhile (not a regular like my cousin is). Chat, eat some delish dessert while lingering over that latte with your friends. Always a cozy warm vibe here. The last time I came in here was for some cookies to go as we didn't want to sit in (always a wait but worth it).",1
"Emily's West Village location is worth a visit. Make a reservation to ensure heated outdoor seating, or brave one of the unheated tables right by the street. Or just wait a few weeks for indoor dining to return, at 25% capacity. Regardless, a reservation is recommended. The burger is famous and fully lives up to its reputation. Gives the Black Label burger at nearby Minetta Tavern a run for its money. The pretzel bun is delightful, the beef delicious, the cheese and sauce savory and sweet. One of my favorite burgers in New York when I really want to indulge. Emily also makes pizza, and it's amazing. I'm partial to the Arenstein, adorned with ""pink"" sauce, hot pepperoni, pickled peppers, and honey, all atop a crispy Detroit-style crust. Pair with a caesar salad to get that green leafy crunch going on; yes, those are real anchovies on top. There are train stations nearby, and it's easy to get here by Citi-bike. 

There's also a Brooklyn location, and of course the Emmy Squared spin-off pizzerias. Plan for a fun dining experience and budget accordingly.",1
"Overall 4.5/5. This place is so satisfying. It's been difficult finding a pho that has enough aromatics in their beef broth but this place does it right. It's not just a beef soup, they add enough spices to make it an authentic pho. We tried their fish tacos, bo bun hue, taro chips and pho. The fish tacos were so tasty, even the taco shell batter was seasoned. It came with lots of pickled veggies which kept it light and refreshing. The fish was also tender and cooked perfectly. The bo bun hue was nice and spicy, definitely a nice alternative if you're not feeling pho. Love love loved the tarp chips, so thin and crispy and comes with an amazing dipping sauce. The ambience is modern and hip. Bonus points for the bathroom door (won't spoil the surprise for you guys). Next time, we'll definitely try their bahn mi!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The poke bowl I ordered was very fresh and flavorful. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the veggies were cooked to perfection. The only downside was that it was a bit spicy for my taste, but overall I really enjoyed my meal. I would definitely come back for lunch.",1
Stopped by on a random Wednesday for lunch. They have ample seating indoor and outdoors which are spaced apart to make you feel safe. Their indoor seating has huge open windows for good ventilation as well. Service was friendly and fast here. We got the lunch specials which comes with a free drink. The lunch deals here is so worth it. We ordered the chicken enchilada and salad bowl with a beer and red sangria. I'm picky about my sangria and it was perfect here. It had a good fizzy-ness to it with a good balance of booze and fruit. The dishes were piping hot and so flavorful. Everything was seasoned perfectly and tasted fresh. The mole sauce here had just the perfect amount of spice and hint of smoky kick. Will definitely come back here when craving Mexican food.,0
"Overall, I thought the food was okay - nothing too amazing but also not bad. The steak fries were good and the chicken was nice and juicy. I'm not a big fan of plantains so I didn't try, but the salad was good albeit unremarkable. If I'm in Manhattan looking for barbecue, I might look elsewhere, but I don't see one being too disappointed eating here.",1
"This is my new favorite Italian restaurant in this neighborhood! I love how easy it is to make a reservation, and I actually went here two Friday nights in a row. The first time, we didn't have a reservation but were able to walk-in since there were free tables, and the second time, we made a res on OpenTable. First off, the service is great. They pull out your chairs for you, and when one of our friends didn't arrive for until 30 minutes in, they kept his entree warm in the kitchen so that it'd be fresh for when he did arrive. The food is also tasty. My favorites are the pear salad and pesto gnocchi. The pear was so sweet and whatever dressing was used was so flavorful, and the gnocchi had a delicious aftertaste. I'd highly recommend coming here for dinner!",0
Brunch review!! Perfect for girls brunch 5/5 every time - mocktails- fireService - fireAmbience - firePancakes - fireMix of healthy and savory - fireLocation - fireWill defi be back for a nice dinner date,0
"I really enjoy eating at Jaiya, and I think it's a great place to go for Thai food. The pad Thai I ordered was really good, and the papaya salad was fresh and tasty. The only downside was that the salad was a bit small, and I didn't enjoy the chicken with chili and basil sauce very much. I think it would be a better idea to order something different if you're looking for something spicy, as the level of spiciness is a bit too intense for my taste. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Jaiya, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Came with a friend for Sunday brunch.  I had the chicken and waffles as well as a pineapple juice.  It was a little crowded and service was a bit slow but we did get our food and had an overall good experience.  We saw the place do Stevie Wonder's ""Happy Birthday"" to a table behind us where someone was having a birthday.  It's certainly a better selection than some cheesy restaurant version of ""Happy Birthday"" and remember, you're in Harlem so it's all urban here.The vibe was pretty nice and the food was good so I'd probably go back if invited again.  I actually found the place and my friend didn't seem unhappy about it.",0
"Visited here again recently and the portions are much smaller than I remember. Covid I guess? Either way I ordered the salmon with coconut rice and the portion of rice was smaller than my fist. The calamari soft, flavorful and incredible and the drinks are still strong and well made, but the sweet plantains were tough, not ripe and barely fried through. Cuba is my go to spot if I'm hanging in the village, but the food can be a hit or miss.",0
"Wasn't a huge fan of the food itself, but the cost is unbeatable. Felt the steak was overly charred and we asked for Medium and it came out Rare (suuuper pink). Normally like a charred, smokey taste but this was just too burnt. The sauce they pair the steak with is similar to a Hollandaise sauce, definitely has an egg yolk-base. The salad and service were both great. And how the fries are unlimited is a nice offering. But probably wouldn't come again for the steak itself. As for the wait, friend and I came on a Sat at around 1-2pm and we were seated within 20 min or so which wasn't bad at all considering how the line wraps around the block sometimes, especially for dinner.",0
"I had a great experience at Jack's diner! The interior is very cute and the waitstaff was very attentive and polite. I ordered the green shakshuka and it was delicious. The only downside was that the brioche was so soft, it was hard to eat it with the shakshuka. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend!",1
"The food was okay, but I was really disappointed in the small portions and the fact that they just threw everything into a tiny container. I don't think I'll be coming back.",1
"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The prices are low, but the quality is not that great. The shrimp dumplings were overcooked, and all of the other items were stuck together. The service was slow, and I had to order from the waiter. The baked pork bun was the most popular item, and I have to come back and try it. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"It was a beautiful sunny day in Manhattan. My friends and I decided to go on a stroll aka drink wine while walking around Manhattan. We landed in Little Italy to go to the fair. It was very crowded and we were very peckish. A friend wanted pizza because duh we are in Little Italy and I wanted a cocktail. All the restaurants were booked and were not little doggie friendly so we had to find a table with this little rule. We managed to find a table at this place and I grabbed an espresso martini for some reason. It is not something I normally drink, but I just really wanted one that day. We got a margarita pizza to share and wow! It was delicious! The espresso martini was delicious a well. I ended up drinking three of them and a pretty good buzz followed. Now I cannot seem to get enough espresso martinis. Would go back here in a heartbeat if I am ever in the area.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch, and unfortunately they only had the veggie 2.0 available. I was hoping to try the original veggie dumplings, but they didn't have any. The dumplings tasted decent, and they weren't too salty. I also liked that the dumpling skin was not too thick. The restaurant was pretty empty, and I didn't see any drinks in the fridge. The staff/service was cold and standoffish. Overall, I didn't enjoy my experience at this restaurant.",1
"I always have a great time at this restaurant. The flavors in the meat are already so beautifully set, and you just have to execute! Highly recommend!",1
Los Tacos No 1 is a great place to get tacos! The food is delicious and the service is quick and no-frills. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for some delicious Mexican food.,1
"Phenomenal chicken sammies, cocktails and snacks.We sat for 2 near the front bar rifght before the kitchen opened at 5pm on Friday. The unique numbered cocktails are on-tap and all-around tasty. You might notice not all numbers are available. One of the cofounders mentioned they're currently releasing new drink numbers (and menus / menu items) slowly as they open during COVID.We had the chips, the hot honey sandwich, and the salted duck egg sandwich. Wow. The sauces are delicious. The standout is the hot honey sandwich, which I'll probably get every time after tasting the whole menu. We finished with Le Big Mac, a macaron ice cream sandwich that looks, well, like a Big Mac.The careful design details, quality of the fare, and decor all make for a wonderful (and surprisingly funny) experience. Don't miss the clucking in the bathroom.Also, the bus stop outside is convenient.",0
"Community Food and Juice is situated right near the 1 train station and is a neighbor to Columbia's main campus. My friend and I wanted to grab brunch and we assumed that a weekday afternoon (around 1 PM) would guarantee that most people would be at work or in class-- we were wrong; the place was packed! Fortunately, because we were only a party of 2, we were seated right away. Because it was a weekday, we were given the lunch menu; however, there were still plenty of breakfastesque choices available!My friend couldn't decide what to get so she asked the server for his recommendations- he recommended the biscuit sandwich ($14) and the huevos rancheros ($14). She ended up choosing the biscuit sandwich and it was colossal! It came with scrambled eggs, chicken-apple-rosemary sausage, cheddar cheese, a home-made biscuit, with tomato jam on the side and carrot hash browns. It was so huge she had to eat it with knife and fork.I ordered the tofu scramble ($13) which could also be made with egg whites. It was scrambled with asparagus, topped with a huge avocado wedge, and came with a side of 7-grain toast, and a carrot hash brown. My only complaint is that the portion of tofu was too small. It also needed a bit more seasoning, but I used their hot sauce which helped enhance the taste.All in all, this is a great breakfast/lunch joint to check out if you are in the area or live around here. However, I don't think I would come out of the way to try it again, as there are plenty of amazing brunch options in NYC.",0
"Fresh and delicious ingredients at this Italian chain that has locations at select cities around the world. This location is at the heart of the South Street Seaport area on popular Front Street.The prosciutto and burrata appetizer was one of the best and freshest I've ever had. It was accompanied by olives, artichoke hearts and other assorted toppings. My steak was delicious and a large enough portion to share with my friend. My other fiend's pasta wasn't as great as she was expecting, but she was still excited to see it on the menu as it's hard to find at other Italian restaurants - pasta alle vongole (linguine with clams).Desserts (gelato) and chocolate cake were amazingly rich and good. Had a great glass of Nebbiolo (red wine), which I would highly recommend.",0
"I visited this Paris Baquette in K-Town and it was pretty typical. They had a good amount of bread and pastries available, and it was like walking into an alley. The only thing that was different was that they had a variety for me to choose from even though it was 9:30 PM! Overall, it was a decent experience and I would recommend it to others.",1
"I'm a big fan of this spot! The Azuma Gozen is a great value at $23.50, and the hot soba is always a hit with me. The service is always great and the atmosphere is clean and inviting. I really appreciate that they're always following Covid restrictions and having hand sanitizer available at our table.",1
"This place is amazing! The service is always quick and friendly, and the food tastes great. We've had falafels at the place and both times they've been really good. The falafels have great texture and flavor, and I'd definitely recommend them as a light lunch or snack. My boyfriend and I have also enjoyed the bowl here, and it's been enough to fill us up for lunch. So, if you're looking for a good and affordable lunch option, definitely check out this place!",1
"Meh is what comes to mind with this joint. In my opinion, the burgers we had were simply greasy af and mediocre. I had the raclette cheese burger that was full of mushrooms. It's served with a truffle mayo. I dislike truffle anything so I asked for no mayo. The nice dude at the register said don't fret, we have regular mayo. Cool! He even told the chef. But...the chef didn't listen. My greasy burger had truffle mayo. YUCK!The fries were freakin amazing though. They are fresh. Fresh meaning fresh cut taters! My favorite! It's apparent to me that I simply ordered the wrong thing (I love cheese, I love raclette cheese more than anything!!!). Looks like we shoulda tried the lobster mac and cheese.I do need to give a shout-out to the register guy. He was truly a nice guy. There are a few tables for indoor dining and a few seats outside. Great location, just steps from the train.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was attentive and helpful, and the food was great. I especially enjoyed the salmon, which was cooked perfectly. The only downside was that the wait time for our food and drinks was a bit long, but overall it was a great experience.",1
"Chili on 37th is a fantastic restaurant to get together with friends, and enjoy a meal family-style. Our waiter/owner(?) went above and beyond his task of serving, making us feel at ease with plenty of banter and recommendations (plus he took shots with us -- how cool is that?) The food over here is not cheap at all (entrees are $20-30+), but it pays its worth in taste. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, soup Dumplings, and wontons in chili oil as appetizers. The first was yummy (still prefer Best Szechuan's but still very good). The soup Dumplings were an excellent choice. However the wontons were a bit disappointing. A little too sweet, even. For entrees, the fried rice with shredded tea smoked duck is a winner! Make sure to sample this dish. The Chungking Spicy Chicken and Cumin Lamb are both fantastic too, although they could be spicier, even. The sauteed Cauliflowers was fine (I am not the biggest fan of this particular veggie). The fish Stew reminded me of dry pot style fish fillets, and it is a plentiful albeit not-so-cheap dish. We ended the night with baijiu shots and the rice wine soup. I liked the baijiu, even though my friends weren't a fan of the aftertaste. As for the rice wine soup, it is a desert with rice balls that are filled with either peanut or sesame, and is quite tasty.Have your meal family style, and it will feel worth it, having sampled many favorites from the Szechuan cuisine.",0
"I love this place. The pasta is so fresh and amazing. I typically order delivery or pick it up. Ignore what people say about the portions. The to go container is a huge cylinder and I can't eat it in a sitting, I have plenty left over. I love this place. The people are so friendly and food is reasonably priced and good. Love the carbonara, the garlic one, mushroom pasta too. I've had bites of the others too. Nothing disappointing ever.",0
"H and I stopped here for pre-show dinner. She's the best date! 

Grilled cheese and tater tots. Who can ask for more? We both ordered a classic grilled cheese and an order of shop tots. The bread was a good size white bread and the cheese tasted like your typical American cheese. Buttered on the outside, possibly also on both sides. The bread was crisp and the crust was crunchy. The cheese was gooey and stringy when you pulled the two pieces apart. The shop tots were cooked very well topped with Parmesan cheese. They were toasty and crisp in the beginning and stayed crispy until we finished eating. Definitely a great stop for an on the go meal. Friendly employees and food made fast and fresh.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The selection is always changing, so it's always refreshing to the palate. The line always moves fast, so you never have to wait long. And the serving size is always more than enough. I highly recommend this place!",1
"I can vouch for the frozen piña coladas, the cheesy quesadilla and the loaded nachos. Also the amazing little outdoor seating parklet where we were able to get a table for like 8 on a Friday evening without a reservation. Oh and also everyone that sat us, took our orders, brought out drinks, and rang up 8 different people for everything they individually ordered. The pina colada stole the show. I never order drinks quite this fun but when I heard a few other people at my table get one, I immediately had to jump on that bandwagon. It was my only drink for the night but I loved it. And the food! I split the quesadilla and nachos with friends and both were fantastic. I especially loved quesadilla. It was stuffed with all of the cheesy goodness, definitely not wimpy and really tasty. I wished I had a full one to myself. For someone who rarely does the ""walk until we find a place"", I am so happy we stumbled upon this gem. I will absolutely make plans to visit again and treat myself to another frozen colada.",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at Crave Fishbar during COVID season. The selection of oysters was a bit disappointing, but that's to be expected with the restrictions on the oysters. The prices have also increased, but that's to be expected as well. The service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected during busy times. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to others during COVID season, but I would caution them to be patient during busy times.",1
"I guess if Rooftops were edible and  could also double as good servers, I would give this place a better review.Unfortunately,  neither is possible! Went for brunch and it was beyond average. Ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was swimming in salad dressing which seeped into the hollandaise sauce, which essentially turned the English muffin back into dough. Gross!  Two of us ordered that item and didn't eat it.Others ordered the brunch burger and the pork belly was all fat. Terrible. French fries were good. Our food was served and server rushed off. We had to wave her down to get us silverware (some 5-10 mins later). Shouldn't that have been on the tables first? Or least when we sat down?They prominently displayed a drink special on their menu (a pitcher that serves 6) with 5-6 cocktail options. When we tried to order a pitcher, the server said that was not one of the specials although it was in the category. She said there was an asterisk next to it but it got erased (meaning it was excluded). Are you serious? It's not the money, it's the principle. Bait and switch! Place was hardly full so I can't explain why the food and service was bad. I would hardly call this a great rooftop spot.  Skip it unless the owners do something about the service, quality of food, and accuracy of menu representation!Never going back! There are tons of great brunch places in NYC.  If you're staying at this hotel, go elsewhere for brunch.I don't think the owners care about service and food satisfaction.",0
"Daniel;The two Michelin star eponymous restaurant of Daniel Boulod.Amuse bouche was tasty- can't remember details of ingredients... (see photo)The Foie Gras terrine was one of the best preps of foie gras I have ever had.  The inclusion of sumac (used traditionally table side with Persian dishes) probably impacted me and my palate more than perhaps others.  Regardless it was a creative and unique touch.Obligatory photo of the phenomenal bread (in-house I believe) and olive oil.The scharbauer Ranch Beef is supposed to be a must-have.  Lived up to expectations.   Pomme savonnette was the only true 'miss' of the meal.  Too firm and cool.Apricot dessert was decent, but I will try something else next time.Chocolate dessert and complementary mini pastries and house made madelines were phenomenal.Wait staff and especially the Sommelier were engaging and warm and lovely. Taste- 8/10Creativity- 8/10Presentation- 10/10Service- 10/10Ambience- 8/10Overall I think this warrants two Michelin stars and lives up to expectations.  Would highly recommend if you are in town.  I would go again next time I am in NYC.",0
"I visited Da Dong with my aunt and cousins a year or so ago. Prior to that, my mom had sent me a link telling me it was opening in NYC, as it's a famous Beijing-based restaurant. When my mama recommends visiting a Chinese restaurant, who am I to argue?The vibe is very hotel-bar, which might be someone's jam, but is all wrong for the Chinese food I grew up eating. One of my favorite things about Chinese food is that it's not about ambiance, which is refreshing in the Instagram era. Sometimes, I just want the food to taste good - I don't care if it looks good on camera, or if the restaurant's decor is cute.I recall the duck being tasty enough, but the part of the dining experience that really sticks in my memory was the (white) waiter dropping off the duck (with assorted accoutrements - pancakes, tianmianjiang, cucumbers and green onions), and proceeding to ask my aunt, cousins, and myself (all very clearly Asian, if not obviously Chinese) if we knew how to put all the components together and eat it. I remember being very amused by the question, as if a white person could best instruct a group of Chinese diners on the correct way to eat Peking duck. (Not to mention that it's pretty obvious, based on the components, how you would assemble and eat it...)I probably wouldn't recommend coming here - the food is fine, but you can get as good or better for less money.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant with a friend for her birthday and it was a great experience! The service was top notch and they even supplied us with candles (which are usually more expensive) which was really nice. They also took Polaroid pictures of us which was really fun. The food was all really good and I especially enjoyed the beef tripe dish, chicken, and fish. The fried rice came with duck and I'm usually not a fan of duck but it blended well with the rice. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant! All those dishes between the four of us and the total was like $160, which is definitely worth it!",1
The Grayson is a great place to go for a cheap bloody mary and some old school music videos. The bar was easy to get served and the place was pretty big. I especially liked the additional space downstairs that opens up in the evenings.,1
"I had a terrible experience ordering food from Grubhub. I ordered food for two people and it took two hours for it to arrive. When it did, it was cold on our doormat. I won't be ordering from this place again.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was affordable and delicious. The ordering system was a bit confusing, but it didn't take long to get our food. The seating was a little confusing, but it was all worth it in the end. The only downside was that the restaurant got pretty crowded around 2 PM, so it was a bit difficult to find a seat. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"Passed by this place sooo many times but never really had a chance until the post-covid days. Much credit to this joint for surviving the pandemic.  It has surely been such a struggle for so many local businesses. As a result, it is awesome to give places a try. Had the ramen from the menu and potato salad. It was so on point. The truffle oil made it such a unique addition.  Indoor dining is available and there are only high stool chairs. The entire set up is cozy and the service and cleanliness were very excellent. I would definitely recommend to friends. Please support your local businesses. It is because of them that our neighborhood provides us with such fantastic cuisine options!",0
"3.5 / 5.0 - We were in Hell's Kitchen and came to try their brunch.The service was great. The staff was friendly and we felt welcomed as soon as we entered the restaurant.We ordered:- Grain Bowl- Steak and EggsWe shared both and liked having the variety. The Grain Bowl had a wonderful combination of fresh ingredients and was a nice healthy option. The Steak and Eggs wasn't anything to write home about.The main issue we had was with the bugs flying around. It was quite bothersome, especially considering we were seated indoors. The ambiance was lovely, so hopefully, they can deal with the bugs to offer a more pleasant experience.",0
"I had a great time at this little cafe/restaurant in Georgia. The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. I especially loved the meat pies - they had a great crust and flavorful beef filling. They also have other pies, like a veggie or cheese one. The chashushuli was a flavorful beef stew with bread - it was really good on its own, but I also enjoyed it with mash potatoes or rice. The eggplant roll wasn't bad either - I like how they are introducing new menu items as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some great Georgian food at a great price.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying Carbonara, but I'm glad I skipped it because the ravioli was really delicious. The lemon-y flavor was really refreshing and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. The pizza was just so so, the topping fell apart. Overall, I had a really good experience at Rubirosa and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant the second time around. The dim sum was fresh and authentic, and the prices were reasonable. I especially loved the har gaw (shrimp dumpling) and ham sui gok (Fried Rice dumpling). The dim sum still tasted good after a 30 minute subway ride, which is a testament to the quality of the food. The only downside was that the noodles could have been better.",1
"{Overall: 4; Food: 4} Atmosphere: 3; Service: 3One of the two solid Chinatown sit down dim sum restaurants. They have an extensive menu with a ton of options to choose from. They execute well on a lot of the classics that other restaurants can't always get right (i.e. beancurd skin roll).The cons of Golden Unicorn is that the wait can be very long if you're coming during peak weekend times and the prices are very high vs. similar Chinatown dim sum restaurants. For this reason, Jing Fong is usually my go to choice. The food there is similar, but about half the price.",0
"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on the great reviews, but overall I wasn't too wowed. The food was good, but not great. The service was great, though.",1
I was not impressed with this pizzeria at all. The pizza was over cooked and dry. There are definitely many other better pizzeria's in the area.,1
"Overall, I thought the food was great, but the service was not up to par. I think it would have been better to go to the bar instead of waiting two hours for food to arrive.",1
"My friend recommended La Bergamote so we decided to meet up here for coffee. I ended up getting the Success, an almond meringue with hazelnut buttercream and almonds. I loved it! It was crunchy on the outside but still able to crack without any effort to get to the soft buttercream inside. It was subtly sweet and would have been great with coffee had I gotten any. This is a tiny cafe and cozy. The staff is so sweet and friendly and didn't rush us at all even though it was near closing.",0
"I was really impressed with this restaurant! The chicken katsu curry was delicious and everything came out so well-fried and perfectly seasoned. The side salad was also really good, and the rice and curry complemented each other perfectly. I really enjoyed my meal here and I'm definitely going to be back!",1
"The food was very good at this restaurant - the chicken quesadilla in particular was excellent. The only downside was that the service was not particularly good - we felt rushed to finish our appetizers and our entrees arrived at the same time, which made it difficult to enjoy them. However, overall the food was worth going to.",1
"My office is right around the corner so I've come here for lunch a couple of times. It's cozy and friendly and the staff is attentive. They make their own sausage and it's really delicious. Desserts here are fantastic. I highly recommend the creme brûlée. The mini cannoli are popular with my coworkwThe entrees are a bit pricey, but I found my fettuccine flavorful. My friend got one of the daily specials and he didn't think it was seasoned enough, but I tasted a bite of his and thought it was fine. As he kept eating, he changed his mind and said it was okay. The grilled octopus was flavorful and pretty, but chewy. In my experience, the uglier the octopus, the more tender (I guess from beating it into tasty submission?)",0
"The Adjaruli was delicious - the outer dough is buttery and soft to be used to dip into the cheese! The Khinkali was just okay - the skin is too thick to enjoy. The Phkhali Trio (3 dips of eggplant, spinach & leek with ground walnuts, fresh herbs & Georgian spices - it doesn't come with bread!) was also good. The house eggs had a smokey taste from the smoked pork belly and reminded me of a quiche. The wait staff was not very helpful or friendly; in fact he told us that next time we should not order the Mushroom & potatoes, since it is not considered traditional Georgian food. I would come back to try the other dishes but was a little underwhelmed since I heard good things about this place.",1
"I got the $13 vegetable soondubu aka Korean soft tofu stew. It tastes nothing like soondubu. It has oddly sweet and sour taste- kinda like Thai tom yum soup. Also, the ""vegetables"" in my stew were just loads of onions. Really? Unless you're into sour soup, I would not recommend getting this dish.",0
"I came with relatively low expectations, as I had a negative experience on their UWS location a few years back. Came in on a quiet Saturday afternoon and had a really nice meal.We opted to split the rigatoni, then each got a chicken parm sandwich. The rigatoni was really damn good. Is it as good as Carbone's? No, but its  sure as hell cheaper and was still damn delicious. The chicken parm sandwiches were also pretty good. My only real gripe is that I found the chicken cutlet to be a little chewy, not too badly but a bit more than I'd like.The place was basically empty but the service was perfect, and it was a really pleasant meal and overall experience. I'll definitely be back if near the area, or will give one of their other locations a shot.",0
"The vegan bacon was a bit of a surprise, but it was delicious! The mac n cheese was also great, and I especially loved the shitake bacon. The kale artichoke dip was also good. The only downside was that the bread was a bit dry. Overall, though, I had a great experience at this restaurant.",1
"King Co Imperial is a great restaurant with good Chinese food. The service is great and the atmosphere is really fun. However, I didn't think the food was that great. There was too much soy sauce and it felt a bit Americanized. However, the scallion pancakes, cold sesame noodles, and crispy Sichuan oyster mushrooms were all really good.",1
I just wanted to say thank you to the owners and staff of this restaurant. Thank you for surviving the pandemic and for being so hospitable. The food is great and the prices are fair. The lamb shank was especially delicious. I really enjoyed watching the people go by on the outdoor patio. Thanks for just being here.,1
Finally got a chance to try this place! I must say I found the Japanese place in my new neighborhood. Love everything we ordered and be going back when the crave for Japanese food arise!,0
"I was really disappointed with my experience at Three Guys Restaurant. The chicken panini press I ordered was dry and lacked flavor, and the hostess was very rude. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the portions were very satisfying. The only downside was that the seating was a bit squishy and the interior was a bit bland. But overall, I really enjoyed my experience!",1
"Overall, I thought the Headless Widow was a decent bar. The drinks were interesting and the service was friendly. It was a little cold outside, but we made do. The food was decent, nothing to rave about, but I did appreciate the friendly service.",1
"This place came highly recommended for quick, cheap, and authentic food in NYC. The whole experience happened so quickly, I can hardly reflect on it. The guy serving my food seemed annoyed AF that I was standing there ordering. The music was blaring so loud I could not have a conversation. My taco fell apart, although I will admit the contents were delicious. I can see this being a great go to if you live in NYC, but if you are a tourist you may want to find a more relaxing paced experience.",0
"I would say 3.5... I saw a photo of a tasty burger from Set L.E.S. somewhere, so we decided to go check them out for a brunch. They offers interesting dishes with Asian twist, which I always enjoy. They have a Brunch Special that comes with a choice of Home Fries, Tater Tots or Waffle Fries. It also comes with a choice of a Mimosa, Bloody Mary, Beer or Any Non Alcoholic Beverage too! We got one of their Brunch SETs with Bloody Mary. It was pretty good, strong with a bit of peppery-ness to it.We ordered SET 4, Bulgogi Burger, with Tater Tots. The Burger was super tasty! The bottom bun got very soggy quickly, but it was soooo tasty we didn't care... just eat it with knife and fork so that your hands get crazy messy.  We also ordered Pat Lafrieda 30 Day Dry Aged Burger, which is not a part of their set brunch menu, so it didn't come with a complimentary drink. It does come with a choice of sides. I went with waffle fries.Burger was juicy, cooked a bit more than I like, but not over-cooked. Egg was cooked just right. I wish if It had more caramelized onion. It was smaller than I expected it to be, and I somehow thought it comes with more ingredients. The flavor of the Bulgogi burger was better and more delightful than this one. The staffs here were really nice and friendly, and took a good care of us. They do have other interesting menu items, so we might head over there again if we are in the area.",0
"My first time at Cho Dang Gol and now it is my all time favorite Korean restaurant in America! That is big for me to say because I always crave Korean food even though I am not Korean. My friends told me about this place and they were not lying! The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!First off, the side dishes are soooo good. The homemade kimchi ... chef's kiss. I would be happy with the their kimchi and a bowl of rice. My friends and I finished 2 sets of side dishes before the main dishes came out and their servers kept refilling them without hesitation. They were so nice and happy that we love their side dishes. For main dishes and dessert, we got:1. Baby Octopus & Beef Bulgogi 2. Bossam (slow cooked pork belly)3. Seafood Hot Pot4. Red Bean TiramisuLET ME TELL YOU, YOU NEED TO GO HERE! The bossam just melts and you can't stop eating it! We got lettuce wraps to eat with the pork belly, and I was just in heaven. The bossam was definitely my favorite. The baby octopus & beef bulgogi and tofu soup were so addicting too. I was very full half way through but I could not stop eating. And if you love red bean and tiramisu, you need to try their dessert. You will not be disappointed. I will be going to Cho Dang Gol every time I am in NY and recommend it everyone. I wish they opened one up in Boston.",0
"Z Deli Pizzeria is a great place to stop for a pizza or deli sandwich. The selection of drinks is great, and the pizza is good, but it could use a little more flavor.",1
"I had a great experience at Mariachi's! The burrito was delicious - I especially enjoyed the chicken burrito. It had white rice corn sour cream and shredded chicken, and it came with a side salad. Service was prompt and the bathroom was clean. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Stumbled by here completely on accident after a nice meal elsewhere in the midtown area. Loved the vibe.  80's music, great beer selection (not just stout!) and super clean and upbeat atmosphere. Definitely not a NYC dive bar but also didn't feel like a gauche gastropub. I was a tourist so I'm assuming there were lots of other tourists (par for the course in the area) however I also saw groups of locals meeting for food, drink and good times.",0
"It is all about their signature dish.  Off the charts good.   The garden in the rear is wonderful.  Having said that, they could have used a few fans to circulate airflow.  Extremely hot and uncomfortable as was the inside of the restaurant.   Meatball appetizers as well as their lasagna which we shared as an appetizer were also excellent.   Just the wine left a lot to be desired.   Service was just ok.   The staff seemed to get lost up front for long periods of time but certainly not non-existent.  All in all, go on a cool night and enjoy their pasta especially their signature dish.   The food was a 4 star but some of the other issues dropped my review to a 3.",0
"I like how we can make reservations and they seat majority parties, not only when the whole party has arrived.everything on the menu is kind of a slight variation of the item before so not much variation throughout our tables' entrees.blueberry pancakes were good!Chipotle butter biscuits were good but they should give much more butter for the size of the biscuit. It was a buttery flakey biscuit, less soft than most buttermilk biscuits.The omelet with goat cheese was good and filling, and the sausage is sliced rather than ground. Polenta with mushroom was good and flavorful and filling as well.Bottomless mimosas are the main attraction but you might find it difficult to flag down a waiter to refill your tiny glass every 5 minutes that you down it. doesn't make sense to order mimosas unless you get it bottomless (one glass is like $8, bottomless is like $15 or something)",0
"I've ordered delivery from here twice. My first experience I ordered a Biggs Cobb salad. It comes with grilled chicken, blue cheese crumbles, cherry tomatoes, lettuce, olives, boiled egg, red onion, and bacon. It was good, but not $15 salad good. I'm not sure what dressing it came with but it was not for me. I assumed it would come with blue cheese dressing since there's blue cheese crumbles; I was wrong. I didn't eat the dressing at all. I wouldn't order this again.Yesterday I ordered something else to try since the salad was good. I ordered the chicken fingers. They're only $9. It was described on seamless as ""breaded chicken breast tenders served with honey mustard."" I was expecting something totally different. It was THREE....THIN....pieces of DRY chicken. The plastic fork it came with couldn't cut through it; it kept bending. NOT worth $3 a piece!!! Ugh. The only two good things about this were the crunch of the breading on the chicken and the honey mustard. The honey mustard is my favorite thing from here!! But I will not be reordering a third time.",0
"I've been here a handful of times now and never been disappointed with my meal!I love that they provide such an explicit scale for how spicy your dish will be, I've found that the noodles tend to come out a little spicier than the rice dishes, but it's been pretty consistent overall. The extra spicy curry certainly brings a nice kick, but is also very rich and flavorful. It's a little thinner than the medium and spicy curries, which have an almost gravy like texture. The chicken it comes with is solid, pretty standard grilled chicken for a curry spot, but the chicken cutlet or one of the other meat add ons is a must they are much more flavorful. The rice dishes come with miso soup and kimchi, but the portion size of the main dish is big enough that I wouldn't bother wasting space on those two. The service is fast and if you order anything above a medium they will give you a pretty stern warning about how hot the food is. Thankfully they're pretty diligent with refilling waters as you will probably need several.",0
"Visited on Tuesday night for pho! This was one of the pho places where they open late night in the area. There were many customers inside, so i thought it must be good. We ordered combination and combination with meat ball and spring roll. As other reviews says, they place can be little cleaner. Pho was great! Hot, richy and generous portion. It just tasted like they used lots of flavor enhancer. I felt very sleepy after eating. Spring roll was one of the best i have had before. They fried it really crispy and juicy at the same time.",0
"The question I always have about Dos Caminos is if the experience lives up to the name.  I hear about Dos Caminos as a cool trendy place to hang out but wasn't sure if the dining experience was all novelty. I came for a business lunch with some colleagues on a weekday. We walked right in and were seated in the back corner area of the restaurant. It is a spacious restaurant with a long bar. We weren't drinking but it looks like a cool place to get a drink.The lunch menu had all the heavy hitters.  We had to start with guacamole but it comes already done so not sure how fresh it is but it tasted good. The three salsa's that came when the guacamole came out were also pretty delicious. I don't know if it was part of the meal or part of the guacamole appetizer. The salsa I loved the most was the mild one. Great flavor. For lunch, I went with the chile rellenos. I really enjoyed it. There isn't a ton of heat to it but the flavors work. There is a lot going on with the dish but the combination of chile to filling worked. It is a hearty dish so don't come expecting to watch your calories but they were well worth it.  My friend orderd the burger well done but it was still pink. I know chefs hate when people order meat well done but the customer is always right!In the end Dos Caminos lived up its name. It was not just a novelty but a place you can get some good food. I don't know how authentic the food is but who cares it is still good. Will definitely be back.",0
"I like this place, but I really wanted to like it more. The food is good and with a little more it could be very good. The tempura was very good, but it needed dashi with the tempura dipping sauce. The rolls were also good, but the rice was only okay. Also, they have a beer and wine license but a very limited and poor selection of wines and sake.",0
"Double Zero is a great place to get vegan pizza in the East Village. The tomato, basil, cashew cheese pizza was my favorite, but the farro-fennel sausage, tomato, cashew cheese pizza was also great. The wait staff was friendly and we were quickly seated outside. I'm glad they opened a spot in LA because I want to try the rest of the pizzas!",1
"My sister was craving for some seafood. We first stopped by the boil but the wait for a table was 1-2 hours so we decided to venture out and see what else was in the area.We were seated immediately.We ordered the special set which is supposedly good for 2-4 people. The amount of food was decent but I don't know if we are just big eaters or what but it was just enough for us two. The seafood here was pretty fresh. The only downside is the grease and that even though you are given the option to choose your level of spiciness, including mild, they don't give you mild. Unfortunately for my sister, she can't take spice so this was a tough challenge for her. The sauce was tasty but the grease was overwhelming. It made us feel full a lot quicker than normal.The spicy popcorn chicken that came with the set was delicious. Very fragrant and crunchy just the way it is supposed to be. I unfortunately accidentally bit into one of the many spices and it left a very intense feeling and taste in my mouth for a while.Would I come back? Yes! I do think so!",0
I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy my experience at Jane. The food was bland and the prices are outrageous. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,1
"I ate here after seeing John Wick 3. My college friend recommended it, and it was an easy choice since there wasn't much else open at the time. It's fine, with a quirky card system for ordering -- you are issued a credit card that records what you order, and you check out by having it scanned by a reader, and paying the total amount that is due. You stand in line, the chefs prepare the food in front of you on the other side of the counter, and then you seat yourself. I don't believe there is tipping; my friend paid, since I covered the cost of the movie tickets.The food was fine, the chefs appeared hard working, and there were enough people to suggest the establishment has a good reputation but not so many as to make for an unreasonable wait. I guess you could complain about having to queue for your meal, but you'd just be seated at a table doing the same anyway.Everything was in order and appropriate for the price point. I could see going there again under the same circumstances: movie ends; not much is available; and you want a casual, cheap dinner.",0
"I came in with super high expectations based on reviews and online recommendations but left disappointed. Okay, maybe disappointed only because I had high expectations but disappointment is disappointment. I came say what it is exactly other than nothing really stood out to me in my bowl of ramen. I ordered the spicy butter miso and a side of karaage. There was a lot of green onions which I didn't care for too much. I found the broth to be thicker than my liking. I wouldn't say it was bad. If a friend made plans to come here I wouldn't object, but I wouldn't be excited either... but maybe a second trip will change my mind, who knows.",0
"Cho Dang Gol is a decent Korean restaurant, with outdoor seating that is nice and cozy, and overhead heaters to keep you warm. The food is good, and I especially recommend any of their soups. The service is a little on the slow side, but overall it's a decent place to eat. Be warned, though - it can be pretty crowded, so it might be tough to snag a seat if you're dining with more than 3 people.",1
"I had a very pleasant dish at North Fork. The food is  good. There is an abundance of seafood options but some good meat options as well. Dishes you may have seen before but with some added flair that makes them their own. I visited with my GF on a Thursday evening. There was lots of warm candlelight and it wasnt too packed, it was perfect for date night. We started off with the elk tartare and the prawns. The prawns were really delicious. They had a nice sear and were well seasoned. The elk tartare was nice. It wasnt too gamey and there were some key limes that gave a nice pop of citrus. Its a rich dish and the portion was a bit too big for me. Its definitely a dish for 2. For an entree I had the sea bass. Everything was cooked perfectly. It was was enjoyable and the carrots were spectacular. Personally I wish the dish had a little more acid. The drink menu was very grown up. Cocktails weren't very sweet and mostly spirit forward. The staff was very friendly and we even got to meet the executive chef Brian who was also friendly and quite talented.",0
"Tenho Ramen is a must-go for any ramen lover in NYC. The new location is better for foot traffic, but the ramen is still as delicious as ever. The garlic ramen is my favorite, but the Kogashi ramen is also a great choice. The alleyway/Japanese garden is a nice touch, and the bar setup is always a fun date night atmosphere. The only downside is that they can't do outside seating due to street zoning.",1
"Pretty decent slice of pizza after having it reheated. The Underground shops are convenient when getting off the subway and wanting to try new food items, but this slice was nothing too too special. The pepperoni stood out the most!",0
"The atmosphere at this restaurant is great- it's very modern and chic. The staff are also great- they're very attentive and seem to really care about their customers. However, the food isn't so great. The margherita pizza was good, nothing crazy, but the pesto pasta was bad. It was very chewy and hard, and you couldn't really taste the pesto it was very bland. We also decided not to get dessert, and instead just grabbed gelato from a nearby spot after trying the food. Overall, we weren't really impressed with the food at this restaurant.",1
"I didn't think Jack's Wife Freda would be so busy on a weekday morning, but I quickly discovered that this impression was very wrong. Luckily, my party of three arrived as soon as the restaurant opened, otherwise there would have definitely been a wait.It was a hot June day, so of course I had to get a cold brew. They use beans from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, and although the drink was refreshing while sitting outside in the heat, the $7.00 price tag was a bit steep, and ultimately dissuaded me from getting a second cup.We shared an order of fried zucchini chips, which arrived piping hot at our table. As expected, they were greasy, but delicious, and the smoked paprika aioliI complemented them well (and served as a way to avoid burning my mouth).I also ordered the rosewater waffle, unique in its subtle floral flavors. Since buttermilk waffles are more commonly offered on brunch menus, this one caught my eye. It's neither sweet nor savory, but in my opinion, it works. A dollop of Lebanese yogurt and a handful of mixed berries were placed on top of the waffle, and the honey syrup added a light sweetness, similar to agave.Now that I've eaten here, I finally understand why so many people rave about this place.",0
I had a great time at Chefs Club! Lev's food was amazing and the atmosphere was so cozy and comfortable. I can't wait to come back!,1
"First time coming to this place as you walk inside they greet you and sit you. The ordering was quick and receiving the food was quick as well. As for the dishes they was cooked to perfection, however,  my hot stone bowl wasn't all that spicy but delicious nonetheless.  As for the army stew they replaced the spam with real ham which I was disappointed in. I guess didn't place have their own way of making it. I would come back whenever I'm around the area.",0
"ViceVersa had always been a spot I had my eye on. So glad I finally got to try it!! This place was SCRUMPtious!!!! It was about 5-6 on a Saturday night, happy hour was until 8pm. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar to hide the fact that we were considerably underdressed. Leave it to us to go out to in sweats..Boy did we NOT fit in. Anywho! We had an awesome bartender who made great recommendations. We had the Black Truffle Arancini, meatballs and a Burrata for appetizers. The main entree were Tonnarelli chicken and shrimp. Desert was Tiramisu and Crème Brûlée,!which were soooo good!! I've been literally craving the arancini!!! Drinks were also the perfect balance of taste and strength. I will be back!Thank you!",0
"House of Joy is a great place for dim sum. The dishes were all good, and the service was exceptional. Prices were moderate, and the set up was more spacious here. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit dirty, and it was a bit too bright for my taste.",1
"I absolutely loved the mushroom white pizza and the deep dish Sicilian at Upside Pizza! The sauce was delicious and the cheese was perfect. The owner, Noam, was so nice and I really enjoyed meeting him. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious pizza experience.",1
"I absolutely loved Le Relias de Venise L'entrecote! The steak and fries were absolutely amazing - the sauce was delicious and the quality of the food overall was really high quality, especially for the price. The service was really friendly and reasonably quick, and I really liked how the restaurant was understaffed when I was there so it felt like my waiters were really able to focus on serving me. The only downside was that the drinks were a bit expensive, and the desserts weren't as good as the mains. However, overall I was really impressed with the place and would definitely recommend it.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The menu is customizable, there is a lot of variety, and the portions are quite generous. The price is a bit high, but the food is worth it. The flavor was great, and I would definitely go back!",1
"We so want to support all NYC businesses coming out of the pandemic, so I know there are still struggles. Great atmosphere, fun vibe, good music. The wait staff was so good for a PACKED restaurant and so nice & attentive. Bill's is known for a great burger & fries. Unfortunately, because of supply chain issues they were out of buns (substitute with pretzel buns instead) and they were out of fries. It's ok, we picked onion rings and sliders instead. Our meal arrived luke warm at best. The cheese on the sliders was barely even melted (or had just gotten cold). The onion rings and s et potato fries almost cold. Great beer menu and the milkshakes were to die for. We will try again on a future visit and hope it was just an off night in the kitchen. We did not complain as our waiter was phenomenal and we know it's not his fault.",0
This restaurant is beautiful and the bartenders are very talented. The food was delicious and I really enjoyed watching the news report about Betty White's death while eating my spinach pie. The only downside was that it was a bit crowded and I didn't feel very relaxed in the atmosphere.,1
"Visited One19 Wine Bar last night and happy to say I'm already thinking of my next trip there! Intimate spot for a date night or catching up with friends. My server, Gianni, was very knowledgeable of the organic wine selection and recommended an exceptional red. It's noticeable that every wine offering is  intentionally curated and cohesive. I also was able to sample orange wine (who knew there were orange varieties of wine?!) and have a bite to eat. Try the panzanella salad and ricotta bruschetta (both were incredibly tasty!) Their menu also features wine flights and a tasting/pairing menu.  To top it off, One19 even has wine on tap! Solid wine bar all around- can't wait to return!",0
"Back again. It's been a year! God I missed this. Greeted with familiarity as usual! I went with friends and had the traditional spaghetti. Fresh, saucy, tomatoey and herby. My favorite NY place on Earth. Outstanding service, delicious food. It's a damn warm comforting Italian blanket wrapped around me.",0
"I love coming to this place to study. There are small tables and couches everywhere which makes it such a comfy place to do some reading. The food here is a bit expensive so I've only ever had the coffee ($~3) and espresso drinks ($4-6). I usually get the mocha, dirty chai, or latte. The mocha isn't sweet which I really like. It's a bit hard to flag down the waitress sometimes, especially since it can get crowded and loud during mealtimes and happy hour. There are so many nice couches and little table nooks to hide for a quiet afternoon though. I've also been here for dessert and drinks. Drinks are normal price for new york, around $6-10 for beer/wine. The desserts are great though! My friend and I got a chocolate mousse cake and lemon tart to share. Both came out beautifully decorated and did not disappoint.",1
"I had a great time at Friedman's on Rosh Hashanah! The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was great. I especially loved the tofu, egg scramble with avocado and wheat toast. The price was also very reasonable. I definitely recommend this place!",1
Jones Wood Foundry is a great spot for drinks and food. The outdoor seating is peaceful and the backyard patio is a bit small but charming. The sangria was great and the Welsh Rarebit Fondue was hearty and cheesy. The only downside was that the tables were quite crowded and it was difficult to get a good table.,1
"Very good dry-pot, although in general I'd say it's quite pricey. For a single diner, opt for 4-5 items in your dry pot; for a pair, get maybe 8-10. The purple rice is a great companion to the dry pot.Overall: 4/5Food: 4.5/5 - sometimes I wish they'd chop up some of their ingredients a bit more (like cauliflower)Service: 4.5/5Ambiance: 4/5",0
"I absolutely loved both of the bowls I had at Mealpal! The ginger shio koji pork bowl is my favorite - the roast pork is amazing and very meaty. TheMoroccan bowl is also really good - the roast veggies are my favorite part, but the steak also tastes great. I love the light sauce in both bowls.",1
"The food was good, but definitely somewhat expensive for the portions. The sides are super tiny for how much it costs. (~$6 for just a few pieces of waffle fries and $10 for hushpuppies) I don't think the food is necessarily worth the price but it was definitely good.",1
"I think Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles is decent, but nothing special. The beef noodles and duck noodles were good and the meats were tender and flavorful, but again it didn't stand out to me. It was just average. The prices are also average, so it's not a bad place to go for a quick meal.",1
"I decided to stop by for happy hour with a friend on Friday since I saw that this restaurant had recently opened near the area.We decided to just get the happy hour specials, since they were pretty good deals. My friend got a classic margarita and I opted for the coquito. I have to say -- The drinks are STRONG! They really don't skimp out on the alcohol, even for discounted drinks haha. The coquito was sweet and refreshing but still had a kick from the the vodka and gin. The margarita was refreshing and the cup was dusted with black salt. For food, we got the elote, guacamole, and quesadilla. The elote was cheesy and smoky -- absolutely delicious. The guacamole was also pretty solid and the chips were fantastic and still warm when the server brought them to our table. The chip to guac ratio was a bit off though. There were way too many chips for the amount of guac provided. Finally, the quesadilla was pretty disappointing. I loved the tortilla the quesadilla was made with but the inside was pretty bland. There was cheese and mushrooms, but it was lacking salt. Additionally, there was sour cream provided on the side, so that further drowned out the flavors. I wish they could have also included a salsa to pair with the quesadilla to add a bit more flavor.Overall, the happy hour was a great deal. In total, everything came to $20, which isn't bad at all for a restaurant with a great ambiance and for food and drink. I'd like to come back someday to try out their dinner menu :)",0
"This restaurant is a hidden gem in the Hudson yard area. I first thought the restaurant was in the mall but I was wrong. It's across from the mall. The direction toward the train tracks. The kitchen is ran by Chef Linda. She can name every dish and ingredients for you if you have any questions. The service here is really good and attentive. They refill your water/sparkling water. There are many choices in the drink menu. The complimentary bread they serve is delicious. They serve the appetizers first. Then the main course. And then dessert. My favorite dish was the squid ink pasta. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The steak was perfect medium rare. The mini cabbage had a roasted sweetness to it, so delicious.I will definitely come back because some stuff on the menu changes depending on the season.",0
0/5 for service - the manager was rude as was the actual server. I go to the nearby dental school and while their menu was very appealing the service was a huge turn off . I was about to order a la cart but he told me to seat at the bar. The name of the manager was Peter pizarro.,0
"Came here last night with some coworkers. Hostess was a little rude about us wanting to switch tables (she had a 'very specific floor plan!') but ultimately accommodated after 10 minutes. We started with a round of margaritas and I got the cucumber one - was expecting more spice than just the rim but it was still really good. We ordered a bunch of plates and I tried the following :- scallop ceviche - delicious!! Super fresh and there were two different types of mixes-chorizo queso fundido - OMG this was so delicious! Meat was well seasoned and the cheese was great-plátano sopas - tasty but definitely dry. Wish they had some sort of sauce to put on top-fish tacos - plain but very goodOverall a much better meal than expected. Service was great and attentive, and our waiter was joking with our table the whole night. Pretty solid spot in the neighborhood.",0
"I've passed by Sophie's Cuban cuisine many times and always thought it was just a sandwich shop however it serves much more than that. Their steam table of rotating dishes looked and smelled delicious when you walk in. There are 2 lines. One for sandwiches and another for hot food. Both had plenty of servers who worked fast to fill multiple orders from Cornell and Sloan staff on their break. The beef empanada had a delicious filing, flavorful with the right mount of acid from tomatoes and olives to cut through. The crust could have been crisper. Their classic Cuban sandwich was delicious. Bread toasted perfectly with tender pork and all the usual fixings. Lemonade was both tart and sweet, very refreshing. I would definitely come back.",0
"I don't wanna hate but... they fucked up. Now before you go ""blah blah blah pandemic"", I ate this in like January, aight.Anyway, I ordered the cheeseburger/steak pita thing, and was completely enamored. I mean, how often do you come across something that's actually innovative these days? I was getting ready to fall in love then blam! Salt. My pita burger: purger, was marinated in the Dead Sea. That's where the Mediterranean part comes in.

I'm gonna give them another chance because I can't see all the love coming for an overly salted burger, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

Like, I wish the purger was worth the hype because I think the bleacher seating is a nice casual date setup. You're there side-by-side with your potential forever person and then BAAM! Salt. Like, fuuuuck me. But like she won't fuck me now because she's over there having a heart attack from the salt. Good-bye second date.",1
"i honestly used to hate this place - ingredients werent fresh, place smelled weird, salad portion weak af.they've completed changed their image; food is fresh, portion size is great, and they offer a hospital discount for hospital employees(!!!)they're sweetgreen's biggest competitor. i love sweetgreen, and it used to be my go to, but recently i've wanted a more moderate sized salad at a reasonable price, and found myself coming here. my favorite salad to get is the autumn caesar, add sweet potato and lime squeeze. i could eat this every day!! their roasted sweet potatoes r my fav topping. i add it to any salad and its always good.",0
I came here on a Friday and I was back here on Sunday because that's just how crazy addictive it was. Sure our stomachs and bowels suffered for a day but it was sooo worth it!Here's what caused the obsession:1) Mapo Tofu - Due to dietary restrictions they replaced the pork with beef. This is the spiciest craziest dish we had. The second visit we were too scared of the consequences to have it again. 2) Stir fried Cabbage - The manager replaced the pork with beef and it was DIVINE. The 2nd time around the server told us we couldn't do the switch out which was very disappointing. Anyways you MUST order this here. I could eat this with rice and nothing else all day. 3) Dry pepper diced chicken - Absolutely delicious. Be sure not to eat the peppers though. 4) Beef soup with enoki mushrooms - So savory and sour and absolutely delicious. You will always feel like there isn't enough.,0
"Absolutely loved stopping by this restaurant! Made a reservation via Resy for the restaurant but ended up arriving 40 minutes early my friend and I could just go to the speakasy portion of the restaurant. The staff member up in the front made a call & they were able to accommodate us, as it was still pretty early in the evening. We had another staff member guide us down to the speakasy and another person met us led us to our table. It was pretty empty except for maybe 5 other people, 2 of which were at the bar. The ambiance of the speakasy is absolutely *stunning*. I ordered the Midnight Garden drinks & the Fried Chicken sliders. I loooved my drink and the sliders surprised tasted absolutely amazing!! Was so so blown away by how good it was. Overall, service was also spectacular. As we were leaving, there was a gentleman around 7pm beginning to set up for his set at the piano I believe. So there is live music available later in the evening! Will have to come back & check that out. No complaints though about Bo Peep! Highly recommend you check it out if you're able to.Also, note: as of Sep 7 when I went, they had signs saying they'd check for vaccination status but neither my friend or I were asked for documentation.",0
"While the pizza here is definitely expensive, it is also of high quality. However, I have had two experiences where the wait time was incredibly long, and the staff was not very customer-friendly. I would recommend avoiding this place if possible.",1
"My oh my, another top contender for my favorite combo of lox and cream cheese on a bagel. I ordered the Crunchy smoked salmon bagel off Grubhub and added lettuce and tomato. Delivery was right around the estimated time and I was pleasantly surprised to see that my sandwich was stuffed generously with what I requested. One bite confirmed my appraisal: lovely amount of fresh lox, crunchy greens and decadent cream cheese. The bagel had a crunchy exterior and doughy insides. I liked how you could specify how toasted you wanted your bagel. The crunch factor on the sandwich just means you get sesame seeds sprinkled throughout. This isn't quite as good as Russ and Daughters but it will surely satisfy your lox craving!",0
I've been coming here for over 4 years. This is my favorite spot in Dyckman/ Inwood area. They have great appetizers and entrees. The bartenders are awesome and always provide excellent service. Manager is also very friendly. I highly recommend coming here. The  wings are so yummy. One of the best!!  For entrees I usually go for the chipotle chicken with fries but I have pretty much tried everything on the menu from the tacos to the fish and chips and steak everything is all tasty. They also have happy hour with a great selection of beer and cocktails. They have high/low tables & the bar area. This place is great for large groups and a date night. I would recommend checking out the website or their instagram page for special events always happening. I Will definitely continue coming here.,0
"I took a tour of Harlem to know more about the history of it and I was recommended by a friend to come here for the best chicken and waffles in the area compared to some of the other restaurants. I stopped in here on a Thursday afternoon and even then the place was pretty busy so this is definitely a hotspot. When I entered I was greeted very warmly and promptly by the and promptly by the host and my waitress was super tentative and really sweet. I just ordered the reverend Al sharpton and I didn't know this but the dish comes with a sight of cornbread It was bomb! It was nice and moist and had a good mixture of sweet, buttery and savory. Pretty. The chicken and waffle came out promptly and I'll promptly and the chicken was crispy and the waffle was really good. Ultimately I'm giving it 4 stars because I can't say this was the best chicken and waffles that I've had but it is definitely up there. I definitely think this is a great place to stop in for a meal and they have a lot of options on their menu for you to try. If back in Harlem I would definitely stop by here and I highly recommend this place.",0
"My friend took me here after a failed attempt to grab food from Wah Fung, which is closed Mondays, apparently. Located deep in Chinatown (aka, a brisk walk from the metro station), Xing Wong has some great prices for some good Chinese food. We were in a rush so we were ordering our food to go. I decided to get some crispy skin pork, because if a Chinese BBQ has bad pork, are they even a Chinese BBQ? I had to take it to go and didn't get to eat it until a couple hours later - so hopefully it would stand the test of to-go hell. Cash only, $5 for meat, rice and veggies. And soup!A couple hours later, I popped open the lid and found the crispy skin a little... uncrispy. But that's also not fair to Xing Wong since I did let it steam in the container for a couple hours. The flavor of the pork was good and I scarfed it down at the airport. I definitely would love to be back to try some other dishes. But for take out, I would definitely recommend one of their Chinese BBQ meats with rice for $5!",0
"I visited this restaurant after dinner and was very hungry. The pizza was definitely good, filling and affordable. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The service was okay, not rude, but more focused on getting the food ready and doing their job. Overall, I thought the food was good and I would visit again.",1
"Xi'an Famous Foods is one of my favorite restaurants in New York City. The hand-torn noodles are some of the best I've ever had, and the dishes are all very tasty. I love the N1, which is the Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles. The noodles are thick and spicy, and it's impossible to stop eating them once you start. The other dishes are also great compliments to this dish, and I especially love the Stewed Oxtail Noodle Soup. The restaurant is usually pretty busy, but they have several locations throughout the city so it's not too bad. I definitely recommend Xi'an Famous Foods to anyone visiting New York City!",1
"First impression; restaurant was clean with nice decor. I ordered the chicken kaarage and waffle. They served it with some sour orange sauce. It just didn't go with chicken and waffle, so I asked for syrup. I might of offended the host. The chicken had no flavor and the waffle was a bit soggy-like. My husband had it eggs Benedict. It was better than my chicken and waffles. I understand that some places wants to create their own twist on dishes and that's all good. The chicken and waffle just didn't taste right- more so, what I'm used to. You know, flavorful deep fried chicken and crispy waffles. The coffee was a bit weak, tasted like cardboard to me. Overall, it's a nice place. Staff are friendly. I would give this place another visit and try out other dishes.",0
"Cha Kee is a restaurant that is very similar to the Cha Chaan Tang restaurant that I used to go to. The satay beef noodle tasted the same, and the broth was a bit unflavourful. However, the noodle was a bit soggy, and the pineapple bun was surprisingly good with crunchy top and fluffy bun. The butter could have been melted a bit more, but overall it was a decent meal.",1
"The food at this restaurant is great, but the music is way too loud and offensive. It's really hard to ever eat here in peace, as the music is always blasting with lyrics that are incredibly offensive and filled with curse words. It's definitely not an atmosphere that I would expect in a Greek bakery in a family sightseeing area. If the music could be changed to something more appropriate, I think this place would be a lot more enjoyable.",1
Pig &Butter is a great spot for brunch in the LES. The service is friendly and the food is delicious. I ordered the Thai Basil jalapeño Pepper lemonade and it was excellent. Like it so much I ordered two. My wife ordered the chicken and waffles and said she really enjoyed hers as well. Great place would absolutely come back.,1
"I've ordered takeout from Boqueria twice now. Both times were during quarantine and both times everything was great: the seafood paella, pan con tomate, olives, octopus, the eggplant dish. The churros were just ok but everything else was good enough  that I didn't change my order the second time around. All in all it's a great option for Spanish tapas (and I'm sure it's even better dining in)!",0
We go here to get away from the office and enjoy each other's company. It is a much needed spot in an area with a lot of people looking for a good lunch spot. Slow service is a bit slow during peak time but the food and selections are good. We ordered the burgers and turkey sandwich. Well made as well as the fries. We haven't tried any of the bar service and offers yet.Here's to hoping they keep food and service up. Public House gets a recommendation.,0
"Great little lunch spot. Food was great, atmosphere nice. No complaints. Authentic. Stop by grab a bite very quick.",0
"I've eaten at Sophie's twice - the most recent trip being a free offer from Yelp.  Overall, I think Sophie's has solid but not great food, 3/5 stars.Both times I've gotten the Cuban sandwich.  I love cubanos and am always in the mood for one, it's a great sandwich style.  The cubanos here are good, but not great.  Average, I guess. They're tasty in the way that cubanos normally are, but there are some small defects.  The bread is a bit dry/stale around the edges, and in my most recent sandwich there was only a single pickle slice, meaning that most of the sandwich just didn't have pickles.Still, not bad overall.  Empanada was likewise average - decent but not the best empanada in the neighborhood.  I'd go here if I was jonesing for Cuban food, but it's not a destination.",0
Overall: great place for comfort foodStaff: the MC that night was super nice! Since they're only open for a few months asked for feedback on how to improveFoodEggs and tomatoes: delicious and food of flavor...texture of eggs cooked perfectlyClams with black bean sauce: subtle flavor of black beans so if you're looking for a strong black bean flavor you're not going to get it Sautéed spinach with shrimp paste....cooked perfectly with a lot,0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The bottomless food and drinks was a great deal and the food was delicious. The only downside was that it was really busy and we couldn't really hear each other, but our server was great and kept a great attitude. I would definitely go back!",1
"We ordered takeout and ordered the pad thai, spicy noodles, papaya salad and tom yum soup. The portions were very generous! The food was a bit salty, but satisfying overall (not mind blowing, just your average standard thai food). The dishes were on the sweet salty flavour profile. If that's not your jam, then I would be mindful. One blemish we experienced was that the papaya salad didn't taste very fresh, or it was the fish sauce that threw us off, it was very different from the other papaya salads we had. Overall, if you're looking for a quick takeout, I would recommend.",0
"Insanely good! The restaurant itself is so beautiful and fun which always makes the experience better. But the food....The food was delicious. I love that the whole menu is vegan, and it's expansive. The nachos were some of the best vegan nachos I've had. The ""chorizo"" was very flavorful and reminiscent of meat. I wouldn't say the cheese really tasted like cheese (I usually don't think it does) but it was still a flavorful ""sauce""I also love that they have mocktails! The cocktails looked really good but as someone who doesn't drink, a good mocktail goes a loooooong way. Highly recommend whether you're vegan or not!",0
"I stopped by Yoon for dinner after work, and it was a pretty spot. The service was great and the cocktails were delicious. However, the food was just ok. The marinated package was tasty, but the Uni and mentaiko rice were a bit salty for my taste. The biggest downside of the place is that they stopped kitchen and bar service at 10pm. Overall, it's a decent place to eat, but not worth the price tag.",1
"It's hard to find Indian style Chinese food, and Spice Symphony is one of the few places that serves it. So when I get a craving for Chicken Manchurian (chicken style isn't on the menu but you can just order it) this is the place I like to go. This was my first time at this location-I'm way more familiar with the one in Murray Hill. We went during an off peak time on a Saturday and it was almost empty. Great for us-especially with a baby in tow. The down side to this is that the man-who I'm guessing is either the manager or the owner-kept coming up to us, making chit chat, jokes, and generally hovering over us. This could be out of boredom as there were few customers there, or to make up for the fact that they took a long time to deliver our food. I get he was trying to be friendly- but it was a bit too much. They honored the 20% off done in which we appreciated. Per usual the food was good-especially likes the Gobi appetizer. The location is large, spacious and well lit.",0
"LOVE Korean BBQ is a must-go restaurant if you're in the mood for some delicious Korean food. The atmosphere is great, the music is great, and the portions are huge! The only downside is that it's usually quite busy, so be prepared to wait a bit.",1
"Ordered Amber on Seamless. Had a cali roll, shrimp tempura, and philly. I could only eat half because it was pretty gross. The fish was dry and weird texture. The avocado in my rolls was mushy and brown. I won't be ordering from Amber again.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The outdoor seating is perfect - we felt very safe and the tables were nicely separated by plastic walls. The food was delicious, and our waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating. We'll definitely be back!",1
"Japanese noodle destination with solid variety of soba, udon and more offered.Across the ubiquitous Japanese restaurants in NYC, Soba AZUMA is one of the few places where I have seen a majority of Japanese local and visiting going for affordable and authentic Japanese food.DecorThe two person tables are tight in their design as you enter but the table dimensions are relatively large for your average midtown restaurant. It is a comfortable atmosphere with booth seating and accommodating large groups and solo diners a like.FoodWith a few recent visits, I am consistently happy with the quality and portions of the meals. The Pork Kimich Nabeyaki Udon is a true star which I have eaten twice and it is a solid cold weather option. It has the spicy kimichi flavor with the little bowl to slow enjoy. The Fried Chicken Curry Soba was tasty with the fried chicken but the curry was a little thinner than your average Japanese curry. The fried yuca fries with mental mayo is a winner for the flavor. The crab cream croquette are also a good option. For dessert, there are a lot of ice creams from ice cream with sesame and green tea flavors, green tea tiramasu, and black sesame Mont Blanc. I like the Mont Blanc and I was surprised by the size.ServiceAll the staff spoke some Japanese which was nice even. I think that they did not rush anyone on the meals. The menu is big so it can feel overwhelming but we were treated well and efficiently.OverallI like this location and their Fort Lee location too. I will come back next time that I am nearby.",0
"I visited Brooklyn Dumpling Shop and found it to be a cool experience. The interior is decorated with self-serve kiosks to order from, and the food is delivered in automated lockers. I ordered a short selection of dumplings and other dishes as many of their dumplings were sold out. I thought the Philly Cheesesteak dumpling was dry and the meat was overwhelmingly tough. The dumpling wrapper itself was thick, almost too thick to eat. The other dumplings I tried were not as bad, but they were not great either. The rice dishes were approximately $14 per dish and the protein was really subpar. The concept is intriguing, but the dumplings really need work.",1
"There was an article on this restaurant in the New Yorker magazine that my friend pointed out. He wanted to try this spot because of it and I was obliged to come along when he asked since I'm labeled as ""the foodie"" in the friend group. Hell, I'm ""the foodie"" in all of my friend groups. Thanks Yelp!We shared two appetizers: Homemade Spicy Beef Jerky ($10) and the Sichuan Chili Oil Dumplings ($7). The Homemade Spicy Beef Jerky came in a airtight plastic packaging. Tasted great and got a nice kick to it thanks to the dehydration process I assume. The Sichuan Chili Oil Dumplings (10 pieces) we requested to be medium spicy and dry (apparently it comes in a soup form). Not a bad choice either. I personally would have tested the limits and see how it would be spicier.For the entree, I got the Five Spiced Spare Ribs Hand-cut Noodles ($15), which is one of their seasonal specials that they offered. I requested this to be as spicy as they could make it and also dry instead of a soup. It was a tolerable and not overpowering amount of spicy (not as spicy as I would had expected), while also being able to taste other flavors. This was made nicely done and the noodles are great.They have an outdoor seating area, but don't expect it to be super glamorous like the ones you see at the other restaurants. There's about four stools in the pavilion that they put up. The shop itself is super small. Due to COVID, you have to ring a doorbell that they installed on the side of the shop to get service and you order from the store steps. All of the food will be packaged to-go so up to you if you want to eat using their outdoor seating or not. They are also on the delivery apps, but the menu prices are inflated. Best to order directly through them.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ambiance is beautiful and cozy, and the service was excellent. I especially loved the appetizers, which are a great way to start your meal. The cheese empanada was especially delicious. My only complaint is that the stroganoff I ordered was a little too strong for my taste. However, if you're a fan of mustard or sweet, creamy sauces, you'll love the stroganoff. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Obao is a restaurant that I would recommend to anyone visiting NYC. The food is delicious and the service is attentive and informative. My favorite dish was the spring rolls - they were so crispy and addicting! The drinks were also really good - I especially enjoyed the comrade party. My entree was the green curry, which was herby and spicy, and it was really delicious. The other dishes we ordered were all delicious as well - the noodles were especially flavorful. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend Obao to others.",1
"Came here with a friend the other day, sort of. I actually arrived by myself at first, and wasn't able to be seated because there were way too many people here. Eventually he came, but at this point we were only allowed to be seated at the bar, even though there were seats empty. I guess they were reserved for people who made a reservation?Food comes out reasonably quickly. I got the moussaka, which was pretty huge. Yes, it costs close to $20, but the amount of food you get probably makes it worth it. I wasn't able to finish the stuff. I like the dish, but it doesn't have tons of flavor or anything (is this an unreasonable expectation, considering it's mostly mashed potatoes?).My biggest problem with this place is that there isn't enough space. I understand the desire to want to maximize the number of patrons in a given restaurant to maximize profit, but at a certain point it gets to be uncomfortable, which it was for me. They should consider taking away a table or two, since it was very difficult for me to get from the bar to the restroom.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The sangrias were great and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. The service was friendly and prompt. The only downside was that the food took a bit too long to come out, but overall I thought it was a great experience. I would definitely come back for brunch!",1
"I got takeout at this place to try out their noodles. It looks cute and they also have some neat wall art right outside their location. It was good to try, but I don't think I would go there again. The noodles and the taste was good, but not amazing. Protein costs extra as well. I've had better for the price. They do have outdoor seating and if I was dining there I probably would have found the cost okay for the experience.",0
"I LOVE ICHIRAN. It is officially my favorite ramen spot of all time. So I definitely came twice in my weekend trip to NYC. The second trip may have been while intoxicated oops. The first time, I ordered the Classic Tonkatsu Ramen ($19) and added Mushrooms and the vinegar sauce on the side. Everything tasted really fresh, and the broth was the best I've ever had. Not super salty but so rich and tasty. I haven't finished ramen broth in a LONG time, and I finished my entire bowl there. I added the vinegar half-way through, and it definitely changes the broth flavor in a good way. Love that you can basically taste 2 types of broth with just $2 more :') The vinegar was the only add-on I bought my second trip, and I was still super happy. I feel like the extra add-ons don't add THAT much to your meal. Mhh maybe, with the exception of the premium yakibuta. I tried a piece of my boyfriend's and that stuff is super good omg. As for spice level, I got 2x spicy the first time and felt nothing. I then tried 5 times spicy, and realized that it's not really your typical spicy. I only really felt it when the flakes like irritated my throat and made me cough. In between 2-5 would probs be a good level heh. I love you Ichiran, please open in Boston or CA.",0
"I stopped by this diner early in the morning and was really hungry. The staff was really welcoming and it felt like a safe place to eat. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs set and it was so-so. The chicken noodle soup was really salty, but I put some water in it to make it more tolerable. The bread was really good, though. The floor was a bit dirty, but that didn't bother me. Overall, this diner was great and I would definitely recommend it. The prices are really affordable, too.",1
"Four of us and we all thought the food was delicious although the place is small and thus quite cramped.  Also, they only take Amex although they do have an ATM machine on premises.  They have a very interesting Caesar Salad presentation with a more mustard tasting dressing and it was delish.  We were advised of this when we ordered it.  I did ask for my salad with no croutons and the server said not to worry as they only put a flat bread on top of the salad.  Apparently she did not hear me say I didn't want that either.  To make matters worse the flatbread was broken up into the salad.  Normally a service misstep like that would result in a harsher rating but the food was that good.Those that had the signature pasta dish loved it as much as I enjoyed my oxtail.  The salmon was said to be delicious too. My wife was very OK with her pasta seafood dish too.  She just wasn't as effusive as the rest of us.",0
"I tried Playa Betty's for the first time tonight and I was impressed. The restaurant was super lively and almost packed when we arrived. It was cool that there was outdoor seating especially for perfect sunny days like today.

Our hosts were very pleasant they greeted us and sat us down pretty fast. Iryna was our server and she was very attentive, calm, and very professional. I was actually impressed on how she handled so many tables at one time without a sweat.

We ordered the rad wings as an appetizer and it was honestly the best part of our food experience. For drinks I ordered the Playa Betty house margarita at first and was not a fan. I felt like it had a jalapeño spice to it and it threw me off. I asked Iryna what exactly was in the margarita being that it says a secret ingredient. She said jalapeño actually wasn't inside of it and offered if I wanted to switch it out and I went for the Frozen Paloma Margarita, this was sooooo much better than the house margarita.

I ordered the hang 10 burrito and my boyfriend got the taco dinner. My only complaint was the burrito needed more sauce it",1
"Given that it was a warm summer day, we decided to stop by Trading Post for a quick bite. The outside seating was perfect for enjoying the view and people watching. We started off with some delicious potatoes, scrambled eggs and french toast. The portions were HUGE, and I ended up finishing the whole plate! The service was prompt and friendly. Overall, a great place to enjoy a casual meal.",1
"Food: 5/5

Service: 5/5

Atmosphere: 4/5

"My son and I had lunch here last week.  We were a little skeptical that the food would be good because we were in South Korea and loved the food there. The decor is very nice, we were seated quickly. Our waiter was friendly. We ordered the bimbimbap and burger. Both were delicious. And, we were so pleased. We will most certainly be back. Nice to have a Korean style restaurant in Union Square.",0
"I have been to the Flatiron La Pecora Bianca many times, ever since they opened about five plus years ago.  The Meatpacking branch is every bit as good.  It is bigger, noisier, but the quality of the food remains high with good service and a great vibe.",0
"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I saw a rat scurrying around in front of the kitchen door and emailed the restaurant, but I never received a response. It's really gross and I don't think it's safe to eat at this place.",1
"I thought the presentation of the ramen was great and the place was also pretty spacious for a big group. The only downside is the ramen is a bit too salty for my taste, I would ask them to make it less salty. Otherwise solid ramen place in midtown.",0
"Il Mulino is a restaurant I've been a fan of for years, so I was really looking forward to trying their new Uptown location. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't as great as I had hoped. There was an odd smell in the restaurant, and the meal felt rushed. Additionally, the decibel level for a three quarters full room had 3 of us yelling across the table to be heard. However, the lobster and squid ink pasta was excellent. The prices were not obnoxiously high, so I would have leaned into a 4-star rating.",1
"I have been here several times and I always get ramen. Today, I tried one of Kuu's Donburi Bowls and it delivered. I ordered the Spicy Tuna Bkwl. It' is just the right portion and enough spice to kick off the week (not to mention it's the euro cup today).",0
"Came here for dinner. I was greeted by welcoming staff and we were quickly seated. Ordered the pork belly with pickled vegetables, which is a standard Szechuan dish that takes a while to make, and we were pleasantly surprised by how quickly the food came.Overall, the pork was delicious. It was tender, and the fat mingled well with the lean meat. It wasn't greasy or overpowering at all, but rather tasted surprisingly light. I say it was a bit salty to my taste, but that is a matter of preference. The pickled veggies complemented the rice well, but was a bit much to eat by itself. We ended up having leftover veggies because they do give you a lot.Loved this dish and am excited to try more in the future. High hopes for this lovely restaurant.",0
"This was a very trendy place (not surprising given the area in which it is located). That being said, I found it fairly authentic and interesting. Prices were not necessarily high considering the location, but the menu of course is fairly limited to just pasta, antipasto, and dessert. My boyfriend ordered the ragu (which I regret not getting because it looked delicious), and I ordered the gnocchi Ripieno. The gnocchi was not exactly my cup of tea or necessarily what I was expecting. I got 7 or 8 individual pieces of gnocchi stuffed with cheese and sauce. On top of the gnocchi was like a light oniony oil/gravy (almost clear in color).. it was unique and not bad, just not what I was expecting. I wouldn't have ordered it knowing that was what I was getting. The wine was good and fairly generously poured, and the bread was nice to munch on before receiving our meals. The ambiance was very nice and perfect for a nice lunch date. If in the area again, I'd consider returning.",0
"*Yelp Elite Event*Wow. I didn't know about this beautifully decorated place in Midtown. It's very spacious and overall perfect for a date night!Take-out was a breeze! The hostess was very courteous and interactive. I also liked how they were handling their COVID-19 protocols by spacing out the tables to allow for social distancing. From the curated menu, I ordered the Steak Frites. I asked the hostess what else she'd recommend, and she recommended the LGB Burger. I ordered that separately and both came out within 15 minutes!Steak Frites was amazingly good! It was cooked perfectly and the steak was so tender and juicy. I also tried my boyfriend's burger, and it was literally the most flavorful burger I've ever had. The fries that come out on the side was good as well. They gave out lots and LOTS of fries, so we also ate this for dinner. It was definitely a filling meal!I'm looking forward to going back!",0
"I had a truly superb dining experience at Aaron's Restaurant last night. From the moment we walked in, the service was top-notch. Our host, Aaron, was extremely welcoming and attentive, ensuring that every detail of our meal was perfect. The food was also amazing - I can't think of a single thing I didn't enjoy. Thank you so much to the entire team at Aaron's for always providing such a superb dining experience! I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a truly memorable night out.",1
"We visited Upland for dinner and had a very mixed experience--great food, a pretty setting, but glacial service.I'll start with the food.  We started with (what I believe was) the little gem salad, and it was solid overall.  The cheese was papery and had an odd flavor, but the salad worked as a whole.  The remaining dishes were stronger.  The cacio e pepe was very nice, with a perfect balance of pepper--enough for pepper lovers, but not so much that you won't enjoy it if you're not a fan.  The chicken also had a great flavor, though it could use a bit more sauce.  (The chicken comes with the whole foot, as an fyi, for the squeamish eaters among us.)On to the more disappointing aspect: The service was exceptionally slow.  We spent much of the evening waiting for courses and asking each other when they might come, which always detracts from the experience.  And it took so long that we decided to forego dessert and just got ice cream on the way home.  Our waiter rarely checked in as well, and although we understand kitchen delays aren't on wait staff, an indication that the food is taking a while or an occasional refill of water can't hurt!Overall, if Upland gets its service back on track, we'd happily go back for the food.",0
"I had a great time at Noodle Village! The restaurant was half empty when we came by on Sunday afternoon, which was pretty unusual, and I'm glad to report that it's now free of tourists and unaffected by the Corona virus. I ordered the usual steamed rice rolls and they were even better this time - fresh, soft, saucy and just melted in my mouth. My boyfriend got the hot HK milk tea and the Braised Beef Brisket w/ Curry Sauce Lo Mein and everything he ordered was delicious. The order of lo mein was on the small side, but it was just the right amount for 2 people to share. I highly recommend Noodle Village to anyone looking for a delicious, casual Chinatown meal.",1
"Beauty and Essex is a wonderful restaurant with great food and great service. The ambiance is a little louder and darker than some might prefer, but the food makes up for it. The grilled cheese was delicious and I especially loved the bacon and tomato soup dumplings. My only complaint is that the blue cheese was a little too strong for my taste.",1
"I've only had two items here, since I've been doing the vermicelli binge for a while now. Spring roll vermicelli seems decent and you get the usual fish sauce. Honestly, not too big of a fan on the fish sauce in general. I'll give this a solid 3.5. However, the cat fish was a miss. The fish wasn't fresh and would guess that it's been refrigerated so it was rubbery. Can't deal with that. Seems like a busy place and service could be friendlier compared to other Vietnamese places I've been to.",0
"We had just arrived in NYC and this spot was next to our hotel. It was lunch time. We were starved.  So we are here.It was pretty dead.  Seems like more of a night time spot.  Definitely was busier when we walked past later.  Their menu at lunch isn't super extensive but adequate.  Not surprising, lots of sausages! Our food was ok.  It took a LONG time to get it. The music was fairly loud.The Reuben was ok but I wouldn't get it here again.  It was super skimpy on the meat. My co-traveler's sandwich was quite generous.The place was super clean. They had a huge beer selection. I think if you were looking for sort of a 'German beer garden' experience that's what this is.  It's not necessarily authentic but it is definitely an American tribute version of that experience.",0
"I was really impressed with this new cocktail bar, The Buttermilk. The small menu so far includes excellent sandwiches and a few other snacks, but the real star of the show is the Fried Chicken Sandwich on a Pretzel Bun. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich is a must try, but the Fried Tofu with Sesame and Peanut Butter is also worth the trip. Definitely try the dessert option too, ""Le Big Mac"" ($8), an oversized macaron ice cream sandwich that looks like a burger. They also serve this all to go, and in a nice little takeout tray.

I have still never taken a drink but I would gladly come back here for these sandwiches and hopefully a larger food menu to come soon.",1
"I tried this place for dim sum based on a recommendation of a local resident and I wasn't really impressed. The soup dumplings that everyone raves about was not a favorite for me, but it was good. I did not really get any crab in there. The noodles were really good, basic but so tasty, it was my favorite! The wontons were pretty tasty, as was the fried pork but the presentation was so bland and uninviting. They are using all disposable for eating and serving, this may affect presentation of a dish. I think they need to use regular serving platters, it takes away from the food display entirely. The place was very busy and had a constant flow of customers. We waited rather long for the food over 30 mins. It is worth a try, but if I'm in town I would try another spot. They had a call button by the tables for when you were ready to order, that was kinda cool.",1
"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. For only $16-$17, I was given a pho, a roll, and a tea. The pho was definitely good, with a nice balance of spices and flavor. The roll, on the other hand, was a bit bland for my taste, but still tasty. The tea was also good, although not as great as the pho. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I ordered Nasi Lemak and Pan Mee during my visit with my family. I was a little disappointed that the sambal they gave for Nasi Lemak was too little that I had to ordered an extra sambal for $0.81. The Nasi Lemak is a little too pricey given that there's only coconut rice, eggs, cucumber, ikan bilis and sambal. For the Pan Mee, the soup was alright but the taste of Pan Mee was too soft.",0
"The restaurant had a beautiful interior and good service. However, the food was a bit overcooked and the steak was well-done. The escargot was also very good. The crab cake was huge and yummy, but the breading was too thick. The watermelon and goat cheese and tomato salad was fine. The tuna tartar was above average. The sunchoke gratin was small, but very good. The corn creme brulee was perfect for me.",1
"Came here with some friends for some AYCE bbq and hot pot. Half of us opted for bbq and the other half opted for hot pot. The meat and veggies were fresh, but that was the end of the positives.Our service was absolutely awful. Bonnie was our waitress for the night and she drenched everything on the grill in oil. I mean DRENCHED. She put pork belly on the grill and then squirted it with more oil. It's pork belly... it has enough fat on its own. We told her to cut back on the oil, but she just pretended like she didn't understand us. Every single thing she put on the grill, she added more oil on top. Halfway through the meal, our grill needed to be changed. Another waiter said he would be back to change it, but Bonnie comes and throws more food on the clearly blackened pan. We asked her to change it and was met with an eyeroll. Without waiting for the new pan to get hot, she throws on our remaining meat, which is soaked with even more oil. She comes by and turns off our grill while there is still RAW meat on it and throws it on our plate. The ones that got bbq left hungry because the food was so greasy and hard to eat.Good quality food, but the waitress had a disgusting attitude. If you care about service, steer clear.",0
"I have come here several times throughout my 10 years in NYC and each time it has been excellent.  I used to work a block away from 2013-2016, I came here last year in 2021, and this weekend before the theater.  I'm very impressed at how they have been able to be so consistent - something that is rare in NYC restaurants.The atmosphere - will impress almost anyone you bring here.The service - always attentive and plenty of people to help out.  Our waiter this weekend was kind and patient with my new eating restrictions.  They even had a totally separate menu for gluten-free diners!The food - I've never had anything here I didn't like.  I've been here on a corporate tab a few times where we ordered everything on the menu.  The sushi is over-the-top fancy, but it has the flavor and freshness to back it up.  I used to LOVE the miso black cod, but sadly I can no longer eat soy.  Overall, this is one of the rare gems in Midtown that has stood the test of time.  Definitely recommend.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! It was a short walk from my hotel, and the service was quick and no wait. The food was delicious, and I especially loved the pork in my bowl. The broth was great and the noodles weren't terrible. The Fried garlic and onion sauce was my favorite, and I found myself adding it to my soup quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was great. I would definitely recommend it to others. My only complaint is that the puff puffs I received were not very good. They were quite hard and dense and I had to throw them out. Overall, though, I had a great experience and would definitely come back.",1
"Really tasty, authentic Detroit pizza. Obviously not going for the gourmet angle as much as Emmy's Squared, but in some ways I prefer the rendition here.We tried the vodka, classic, and mushroom. Vodka and mushroom were both keepers and super flavorful / well-textured. I felt the classic could have used a bit more of a punch. They also seem to put some type of cheese on the crust to make it even crispier than typically, which I loved.313-worthy.",0
"I really wanted to love this place but I had just made homemade pierogis and mine were much bigger and tastier (if I do say so myself). What I did like was the variety of pierogi to choose from and I enjoyed trying the Ukranian-style dishes like borscht, which was surprisingly tasty.Maybe I'm just a cheap New Jerseyan but when I pay $17 for a meal I expected a little bit more than 6 small (and a bit oily) pierogis and some sausages. And I think next time I'll just stick with my one true loves, the potato pierogis.My husband got the meat plate and ($21!) and got 4 pierogis and a large thing of stuffed cabbage. Probably personal preference but did not quite enjoy it.Overall would still recommend this place as it rare to find pierogis in the city and of course to support Ukraine during this difficult time, but I will make homemade pierogis myself to curb my cravings next time.",0
"Las Laps is a great place to go for a casual night out with friends. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the staff is friendly and attentive. The food is delicious, and the drinks are perfect. The only downside is that it can be a bit crowded, so be prepared to wait a little bit.",1
"Today was a lunch takeout order. Some of the team headed over to pick up some food. They said the line moved efficiently and the ordering process was smooth. I had to work through lunch today so was incredibly appreciative to have anyone bring me something. I hastily glanced at the menu and said pork quesadilla. The take out arrived on a styrofoam plate (ugh) wrapped in foil. The tortilla was warm but not grilled. It was dense tho. The pork was absolutely incredible. And the accompaniments were delicious and fresh. For $5 I really was incredibly impressed. The green salsa is KILLER. Be warned. I swallowed my lunch in four bites and didn't even snap a photo.  But trust, this place has three important items (fast, cheap, delicious). They did run out of fish by 12:30 so keep that in mind if the healthy criteria is important to you.",0
"The pasta was fresh and I loved that you were able to mix & match so many different types of pasta, sauces, and proteins! My boyfriend & I shared a bowl and it was PLENTY for 2 big eaters. The breadsticks on the side were delightful as well :)",0
"I just found out that this place closed today and I am so, so, SO sad. This is our neighborhood pizzaria. I grew up here, and come back to visit often. We'd get this as a treat all the time. My mom was friends with Eve and John (thanks @Natalie R. for reminding me of names). It is the epitome of NYC pizza. Simple crust, sauce, cheese. What makes it good is the quality of the ingredients. I have brought slices of this pizza, wrapped individually, in my carry on luggage coming back home to Iowa. I really, really hope that this place opens up in a new location. Because I don't want to lose this part of my childhood. And nothing compares to a nice hot slice with a drop of orange oil dripping off the tip. (I blot mine, though.)",0
"The place can be a hit or miss and I think your experience depends on who you know, unfortunately. The first time I tried coming here on a date, looking for just a good last minute dinner in my neighborhood. Despite having reservations, we still had to wait in a 20 min line to be seated, so I cancelled. The second time around, I went with a large group of people and one of my friends happened to know the restaurant owner. We were seated right away and we were offered a plethora of appetizers and desserts without being charged. I think the restaurant wanted us to market the place as hip and cool or whatever... I'll confess however, the food was actually excellent. I'm still thinking about the lomo saltado, spicy tuna, parmesan scallops, chicken empanadas, and the seafood ceviche. The spicy tuna is a MUST.",0
"I visited Pera Soho for their happy hour and it was a very cute spot! I loved the cocktails and appetizers. The babaganoush and the hummus were my favorite of the dips and appetizers. The chicken skewers were a bit dry and lack flavor so maybe stay away from those. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, a great spot for happy hour.",1
"Not gonna lie, I'm not sure why this place was so busy cause I don't think the food is all that AT ALL. Kinda pricey, but considering the location, it makes sense. The onion rings were just not it; dry and no amount of sauce could save them. The pulled pork sandwich was probably the only thing anyone on the table really enjoyed. I didn't snap a pic (and the ones I did suck, so sorry) but we also got the chicken tenders and fries as well as the surf and turf. Nothing to sing home about and over priced for the quality. Don't really plan on returning ‍",0
"Ordered takeout at Mokja thinking it was at the UES location. Turns out I was wrong and it was ordered here. My bad on my part. I got here an hour later than pickup time but all went well. The female working there noticed I was huffing & puffing. Asked if I was ok and I told her the whole story of what happened. I just missed the pouring rain too. She was so sweet and wished me well after I picked up my order. An hour later at home, I tried the food and everything was delicious!!! I ordered 12pc wings (half/half), spicy tuna kimbap, and kimchi pork tofu stew. I couldn't really differentiate all too much between the soy garlic wings and the gochujang(?) ones but either way, it was delicious. Even reheated in an air fryer the next day! The kimbap was standard but tasty. The kimchi stew for me was the star of the takeout. It hit the spot and fulfilled the craving for me! Although by time I got home, 1/4 of the soup was gone because the pork soaked most of it, we still were able to eat it with rice and the banchan served with the meal. We even had some leftovers for the next day, still just as good. If am ever in the area again, I would definitely come here to get food. Solid Korean food. The prices weren't too bad either!",0
"This pizza is very good, I am a big fan of Detroit style and ordered the MVP for takeout. I took off a star though because it was incredibly oily/greasy in the box, maybe would have been different eating it in restaurant but just wanted to point out. I saw comments around the size, but I felt this was decent size for Detroit style -- the pizza is thicker so you get full a lot quicker. I think the size is perfect for 2 people (or 1 with some leftovers!). Lots of veggie options and I'd like to try some of their other items next time.",0
"The manager seemed to be in a bad mood but our server was wonderful. The food is fantastic! You can't go wrong with any crostinis, and the rabbit still has my mouth watering. Can't wait to come back for wine!",0
"Overall, I had a pretty negative experience at this restaurant. The service was slow and the server was not very attentive. I had to request water multiple times and the check took a long time to come. The empanadas were great, but the steak was pretty chewy. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. There are so many great options in the area that I don't think I would bother returning.",1
"We were able to easily make reservations on Yelp and secure a dinner spot for a group of 6 for Friday night. Ease of last minute reservation was a huge plus!Started off with a cheese and meat plate and also ordered two family pizzas. Each family size pizza can choose up to 3 flavors. Ordered one margarita and one mixed flavor. Each family was about 12 pieces total. The pizzas were solid but definitely on the really pricy side for pizza. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for indoor seating which is air conditioned, but indoors is also extremely loud since sound seems to echo everywhere. Outdoors is definitely preferred if the weather permits.",0
[delivery review]So glad there's a piece of Chinatown closer. The knife peeled or knife cut noodles are solid here. The beef was good and they're generous with the  shrimp in the shrimp stir fry. Does not reheat well so don't make my mistake of ordering too much.,0
"I definitely recommend Boqueria if you're looking for some good Spanish tapas. The seafood paella is my favorite dish, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The churros were just ok, but I wouldn't change my order based on that. All in all, I'm very happy with the restaurant.",1
"Ps 450 is a fun bar to grab cocktails with friends. They have a pretty good cocktail menu with fun names. Additionally, I had no problems with getting in or being overcrowded on a Saturday night, which was certainly nice. Overall, I had a great time at Ps 450!",1
"Love Three Roosters - they definitely deck the halls with their spice offerings! The grilled chicken is delicious, but I especially crave their fried chicken - it's so darn addictive! The poached chicken is a nice change of pace and is equally as delicious, but I find myself gravitating towards the fried chicken the most. My only complaint is that the portions can be a bit small - I definitely recommend ordering a side dish to go with your meal! The Iced Tea was a nice touch, too - perfect way to cool down after a spicy meal. Will definitely be back!",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The ramen is amazing - it's so chewy and perfect, and the broth is savory and has the best flavor. The pork is also so tender and juicy. I wish they put less corn and seaweed and more meat, but it's still good! The popcorn chicken was also fried just right and the thai iced tea (free if you check in) is soooo refreshing and light! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal!",1
"A lot of Yelpers gave this place a 3 and I was hoping they were wrong, but that's basically how I feel too.The Yep! chicken and waffles was AMAZING. Definitely get that if you come here. And then the meal was just okay from there. We got the cornbread with pumpkin butter, the corn bread wasn't particularly soft, but the pumpkin butter was nice and whipped. The jerk chicken was strangely Asian, reminded me a lot of hoisin sauce, with not a lot of flavor. Very tender though. Forget about the fries, they tasted like Lay's BBQ chips. For dessert, we got the sweet potato doughnut. The dougnut was a little tough, like it wasn't fresh, but I did enjoy the sweet potato and apples, it reminded me of pumpkin and apple pie during the holidays. And then I remembered it was $10. It was not $10 delicious.Maybe we got the wrong things, but I just left feeling meh about the whole experience. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.",0
Dim Sum Palace is a must-go for anyone visiting Atlanta! The food was amazing and the service was quick and friendly. I would definitely come back here when I'm in town.,1
"This place is definitely not what you would expect if you're looking for typical dim sum. It's more of an outpost geared towards the UWS crowd, and the menu is shorter. However, the salt & pepper squid was delicious and the pork buns were good. The Peking duck dumplings were in a very thin wrapper and were out of this world! We would definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for some really good dim sum.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The service was great and the food came out in an orderly fashion. I would definitely recommend trying the tasting menu if you're looking for something unique and interesting. The price is definitely worth it, and the venue is really nice too. My favorite dish of the night was the beet dish, which had a really interesting flavor profile. The dessert wasn't my favorite, but it was still good. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely come back.",1
"Lets begin with the two rude @#%! in the cash register.  I never experience so much rudeness for no reason, all the time.  I went three times, because everyone is allowed a ""bad day!""  But these two seem so ruthless, unprofessional and uninterested in quality customer service.The employees handling the food are much kinder and the food was average.  However, with so many wonderful other coffee shops in the area, such as Andrew's Coffee Shop, Bread and Butter, etc... I will not be giving them more of my time and money.To top things off, I was buying a loaf of bread and one of the two aforementioned, thought it was her duty to be a ""butter police,"" and gave me two small butters, enough to put on a toast.  When I asked for more she charged me .50 cents.  I complained to one of the cooks, whom suggested I tell the owner.  The owner refunds me my .50 cents.  When I returned another day to get another loaf of bread, the rude cashier made it a point to give me the smallest micro size individual butters.  I don't understand.  Some people should not be allowed to engage with customers... customer service is fun!  Why the owner has hired them is beyond my thought process!!!",0
"This restaurant is overrated and did not have a good experience the minute we walked in. The woman who sat us was rude and obnoxious. We came on a weekday at 4pm. This place had only ONE table. She asked us how many. It was just me and another girlfriend who was also Asian, and a third friend who might or might not join us so I told her 3 just in case. She told me she couldn't seat us until everyone was here. Like are you kidding me? This place was empty and the only table that happened to be there at the time was occupied by two white men in a table that sits 4. Why the difference in treatment? I told her to just sit us first because the friend might not even join us. She snapped back and said very rudely to us that we couldn't switch to a bigger table later and if we really needed to we would have to talk to a ""administrator"". Damn wow.

We didn't find much of drink options or discount on the drinks. They do have a few options for food on the happy hour menu including the wings and the truffle fries. Truffle fries were pretty good and crispy and the wings were a dollar each and pretty flavorful. The service from",1
"I hate the claustrophobic elevator to this location, and spent a good portion of my younger years in the bar upstairs. The second floor is slightly pricey and you will be carded at the door. Seats are cramped around super little tables. This place is better suited for raucous drinks than a friendly dinner. That being said, their kimchi fried rice is delicious and their fried chicken is very juicy. Decent place for soju and snacks if you don't mind college aged drunks screaming behind you.",1
I ordered from Ramen Ya for delivery with work and I was really happy with the service! They sent everything correct with multiple orders and I really enjoyed my ramen - I had the chicken miso. I would definitely recommend them and I'm looking forward to trying their other dishes!,1
"When I think of this place, the huge Parmesan wheel comes to mind. I like the experience they provide, old school Italians with a kick. They serve carved to the plate Parmesan cheese along with antipasti and fresh bread. Yummy, taste great. Calamari and marinara sauce were fantastic. My entree however not so much. The shrimp scampi had a weird taste to it. I would have to guess that the shrimp were farm raised. The corn meals they feed sea creatures at farms gives them a different flavor as opposed to wild caught. The garlic was strong but whatever the shrimp was made of was stronger. I would make the suggestion for wild caught and to source shrimp from South America, worlds' greatest. I tasted flourless chocolate cake, Tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake. They were all super good, delicious! My drink was nice and fused to perfection. Topped the night off with rare champagne, not prosseco, for those jokesters lol",0
"Buddakan is a must-visit restaurant in New York City. The decor is amazing - reminiscent of a James Bond movie set in some exotic country - and the food is delicious. The cocktails are also fantastic. I especially loved the oxtail dumplings - they were delicious and incredibly tender. The family-style dining is a great way to try a few different dishes without spending a lot of money. And the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Overall, an amazing experience that I would highly recommend.",1
"I've been to multiple satellites of this place and while most who come here are all about the infamous burger, I feel like their pizza is just ok. The first couple times I had it seemed impressive but basically it's your average pan pizza... nothing more. Why come back you ask? Consistency. I know if I'm looking for a cross between commercial and good NY pizza (mostly out of convenience), The taste and flavor is reliable. But as far as pizza goes, there are better spots in the city, especially when you see the price.",1
"I came to Felice 64 this past Friday and I can say that I was not disappointed. I was really quite happy overall with the service, food and decor of the place. Although I sat outside, the decor was quite nice on the inside.I would like to highlight that the service was quite good here. We were always checked up on, drinks came out fast and they were very nice in terms of accommodating to our dietary restrictions. I would say 5/5 easily.For the drinks, I got my usual Dirty Martini. It was made quite well and to my specifications. I was very happy with the hastiness in how quickly it was delivered and it tasted great.For the food, I was very happy overall with only a slight problem. For the appetizer I got the Burrata, Cavolo, E Capperi. I thought this was a 4/5 because I was not a fan of the cabbage on this.For the main course I got the Gnocchi al Gorgonzola.  This was a 5/5 and it was delicious. The sauce was creamy and it tasted like proper gnocchi that was not undercooked. I highly recommend this if you're a vegetarian. For dessert I had a espresso with Sambuca which was great. Nothing special overall here.I would give this a 4.5 if the appetizer did not have any cabbage in it. Since I live in the neighborhood I will definitely be coming here more often. I highly recommend this spot.",0
"This place is very cute outside. It is a great lunch spot, maybe a good date spot. We were seated quickly and the waiter took our order shortly thereafter. Everyone was very courteous and expedient, it was a good pace. I ordered the ($33)Chicken Tapaka. It was a crispy little chicken. I wanted to make sure I had enough protein, and while it's a tiny chicken, it was filling. The texture of the skin was perfect. The taste was complex, light, and refreshing. It came with a nice red sauce that had good flavor. It was served with pickled cabbage, which was light and tasty. I actually ate it all, I usually leave it in the plate at other restaurants. This has to be the most refreshing pickled cabbage I've had. My wife ordered the beef stroganoff. It was complex. The mushrooms were very tasty. There wasn't anywhere near as much meat as on the chicken tapaka, if that's what you are looking for. But it was very tasty. I thought my wife was crazy for ordering stroganoff, it most often tastes like it came out of a can. But this was delicious and clearly the chef put love into its preparation. We ordered the honey cake($14) for dessert. It was perfect to split between 2 people. It was delicious, one of the best honey cakes I've had. It has some Graham cracker taste, but not overwhelmingly. I can't see coming here without getting the honey cake. Another table ordered the Napoleon, it was very impressive and I may try it one day. But I can never pass up honey cake. Heads up, honey cake isn't very sweet compared to many other desserts. But it's my favorite. We want to return. My wife said she wants to order the beef stroganoff again. I would like to try something different. Even though the rest of the entrées did not sound appealing, I'm sure I'm I'll find something good.",0
"Crab Du Jour Harlem is a good restaurant with delicious food. The top item is the Po' Boys, which are a nice portion with crispy fried shrimp or flounder. The thousand island dressing is a bit of a letdown, but the chips and boils are delicious. The wait is worth it, especially for the Po' Boys.",1
"Mala goodness!Grain House totally satisfied my craving for spicy, tingling deliciousness.  The standouts include the Spicy and Numbing Pork Wontons and Mapo Tofu. I also got the cumin chicken, crystal dumplings (har gow), yangzhou fried rice and scallion pancakes. All were delicious. Though, the scallion pancakes were a bit too greasy with barely a scallion in sight, so I'd pass on them next time...and there will be a next time. Grain House is definitely sliding into the regular delivery mix!",0
"The Pink Is the New Black is a great place to stop by for a quick drink before a show. The cocktails are reasonably priced and the bartenders are quick to get your order. The only downside is that the restaurant can get a bit noisy, making it difficult to carry on a conversation.",1
"This place is all the hype. Based on food and service, the restaurant is a solid 4. However, the wait to get a table, despite having a reservation is insane. I relate to many yelpers reviews about waiting an hour + for a reserved table. My partner and I went here last night to celebrate Valentine's Day. We had a 9:30pm reservation and did not get seated until nearly 10:45. Hostesses dissauded our inquiries about when our table would be ready and instead asked us to wait by the bar until the table opened up (an obvious ploy to get folks to buy drinks before sitting for their meal). Not only were we waiting (along with several other couples) by the bar, but it was also crowded with a bar crowd and walk-ins. The restaurant entrance was jam pacaked, congested making it difficult to move around or reach the hostess/restrooms.I added a star because the management did give us some samplers in exchange for waiting. Our server, the food and drinks were all of excellent quality and delicious. After dinner, we did try to go to the nightclub and were asked to go downstairs (another hassle) to get a stamp so we could go back up. Frankly the bouncers and club staff were rude and impersonal. This would have been a much nicer experience if the staff had better rules about accomodating reserved guests (not allowing walk-ins to crowd the space)limiting the number of reservation slots to a realistic number of people they can serve, and allowing dinner guests to go directly up to the club.",0
"Ordered to go ; Vegan beyond burger , with sweet fries. Nice & hot and tasted really fresh. No complaints :)",0
"I've been wanting to do brunch here for a while but every time I made a reservation the weather wasn't participating. Finally I made a brunch reservation today.I only took a photo of the hummus/taziki, and red pepper selection that we ordered that came with pita bread. This was very good but the portion size is tiny. We also ordered an extra basket of pita. We expected a bigger portion size for the price.I ordered the dish with quinoa and poached egg, it was very tasty. The quinoa was really tasty and the portion was a good size. The avocado was a bit under ripe, but overall a good breakfast. My friend got the lobster roll and said it was good.The service wasn't the best. Our waiter was nice but we sat got about 10 min before anyone came over to our table and throughout the meal it was hard to find service for our table. The outside seating in my opinion is the best for daytime.",0
"Full menu looks great but a little pricey for bar/fried food. Came for Taco Tuesday and I would say they have one of the best deals around. $2 for really full and delicious Tacos. The downfall... they charge for sour cream and cheese!!! We made it very clear to the waitress it was our first time but she didn't mention the extra charge when she asked if we wanted some, thinking nothing of it we said ""yeah of course."" So she brought out like 10 of each!!! We ended up spending like $15 plus dollars on sour cream and cheese!!! RIDICULOUS. Waitress was also very slow and they were not busy. Would be 5 stars if the service was better.",0
"Oiji is a nice spot for date night or a smallish group dinner. Just a little fancy, but not overwhelmingly so. Fancy enough that they offered a wine pairing with the dessert, but not so fancy that you've paid hundreds of dollars for dinner but are still a little peckish. The food reminds me of perhaps a lower-end and more affordable Atoboy or Kawi.My favorite dishes were the mushroom salad and the scallops. The mushroom salad was composed of dehydrated and dusty fungi, which I absolutely loved. There was a touch of the neglected woodlands about it. The scallops were fresh and delightfully moreish. The bone marrow was a large bone with ground steamed beef on it - it was tasty but awkward to eat. The jang-jo-rim, which was a beef rice bowl, was tasty, but perhaps a little gummy. The calamari was the biggest disappointment - there were two fried pieces, while the rest was a squid stirfry.But the sleeper hit of the evening was really their honey butter ice cream, drizzled with honey and topped with honeyed potato chips. Wow. The sweet and savory, creamy and crunchy combination was incredible. Definitely get this. And the wine pairing if they offer it.",0
"My friend and I had a lovely lunch here. The staff and manager were all so courteous and kind. We ordered the kumquat lemon, and passion fruit teas. They reminded me of the tenren teas! The dishes we ordered were the mapo tofu, chicken herbal soup, bok choy, and Dan Dan mian. Everything was truly delicious and not too spicy. My absolute favorite was the chicken herbal soup because they had all of my favorite ingredients. Additionally, the bok choy came in oyster sauce with shitakke's mushrooms. I highly recommend this dish as the veggie portion of your meal! The restaurant gets pretty busy during lunch time so there may be a wait. The manager Frank was accommodating and constantly checking up on me and my friend. Thanks for the great food and service!",0
"I had patronized a pho establishment at this address years ago and found it to be lacking. So after reading that Sai Gon Dep was under new management with a new chef I headed over for lunch; so glad I did as it was an excellent experience!As other Yelpers have noted the space is intimate and narrow with small tables along one wall and a shared built-in dining ledge on the opposite wall. The decor is quaint and lovely with vintage Vietnamese posters and bright aqua blue tiled tables. Everything was very clean and I felt immediately welcomed. The $16.50 lunch special comes with a choice of roll, main and beverage. The vegan beet/mango roll was beautifully prepared and paired nicely with included creamy peanut dip. Loved that! My beef pho was so flavorful, substantial and chock full of tender brisket slices and rice noodles. Our friendly server explained that it takes 26 hours to create the beef pho's deep flavor profile, and it showed. Chicken pho topped with a poached egg was tasty too, although I did prefer the beef version.Lemonade was tart and refreshing. The Vietnamese iced tea was very sweet so probably would not get that again.Can't wait to return for their dinner pho which includes bone marrow and other goodies.",0
I have been dying to try this famous shop since I moved here and finally bit the bullet today. I had a fabulous time chatting about my weekend while munching away on two kinds of spaghetti and meatball dishes. This was MORE than enough for us. We shared the chicken meatball parm sauce and classic meatball with red sauce pasta dishes. Extremely tasty but i have to say they were a little cold. The portions are large! We didn't finish either and took enough home for one full sized portion. The parm sauce was rich and creamy while the red sauce was the Italian classic we needed. We stayed for a while after we were finished to let the food baby come to a rest. It was a pleasant dining experience!!,0
"After watching a movie premiere at the Regal-- my friend and I wanted some BBQs! What a disappointment!Been here several times and this was my worst experience. It was a Tuesday night, so the restaurant wasn't as packed as I typically have seen it. The staff looked so exhausted.First, I ordered and sipped on the mango margarita on the rocks (which was delicious). While drinking and chatting to my friend  -- the busser literally speeds to the table spilling my ENTIRE margarita on me. The FIRST words that came out of his mouth is ""not my fault...your fault""! What? Have people lost common empathy? I'm dripping in margarita juices, the other guests are looking at me, there's now a scene and this very inconsiderate person is trying to get himself out of trouble? This was very disturbing and rather embarrassing. Thankfully, I had black clothes on and tried my best not to let it ruin my night.Also, ordered my usual chicken and waffles with the henny sauce on the side. The waffle and chicken was a bit cold. I honestly felt like I was in the twilight zone! I expressed my concerns to the manager who clearly seemed like he was on autopilot. I'm finished with typing this review. Bringing back horrible memories!",0
"I had a really disappointing sushi experience here - the sushi rice was really dry and flavourless, and the rolls and sushi pieces were all low quality. For over $100, I expected better quality sushi, and sadly this wasn't the case. We won't be returning.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The chicken was amazing- it was crunchy and spiced perfectly. The rice and gravy side was also great- very tasty and hearty. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting the area. 5 stars!,1
This restaurant is amazing! The service was amazing and the food was amazing. Their margaritas were really good and the chicken fajitas were really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.,1
"I'm ecstatic that there's a new Sugarfish location in New York. For context, I recently went to the Flatiron location early evening and was told there were over 80 parties of 2 in front of us. People in New York are freaking insane. I stopped by on a Friday at 5pm, and there was no wait. Unfortunately, my friend wasn't off work yet, and they won't let you place your name down for later. We went back around 6pm, and we were around the 10th party of 2 in line. I heard the hostess tell someone around 6:15pm that there were ~20 parties in front of them. Point is, there's really high traffic around peak meal times, so 10 minutes can make all the difference. Be smart and try to beat the rush! I actually think Sugarfish is amazing value. I think most people opt for the Trust Me menu ($40), Trust Me Lite menu ($28) or the Nozawa trust menu ($52), though you can order a la carte as well. They also offer a ""Don't think. just eat"" menu, which is similar to the Nozawa Trust Me menu except you may get doubles of some pieces of sushi/sashimi. I ended up getting the Nozawa Trust Me set, and it was the perfect portion for me (with room left in my stomach for dessert). I thought the fish was delicious. A lot of the sashimi came with a light vinegar/sauce in it, which I liked but my friend vocalized wishing it came plain. I don't know if it's worth more than a 45 minute, but I loved my experience. The food was great and the service was on point.",0
"I'd been meaning to explore the Seaport area more and decided to grab brunch at Acqua. The reviews on Yelp looked good, so I figured that it wouldn't hurt to try. Plus, they had reservations open on OpenTable so there was no risk of having to wait a long time on a Sunday afternoon.Everything was fine through ordering, but after placing our order, it seemed like we waited FOREVER for our food. We made eye contact with the waitress and she disappeared to help another table but then returned to ask us if we had a question. We told her that we'd been waiting (probably at this point around 45 minutes?) a while and could she check on it to see when it would be coming out. She reassured us that it was coming soon. I'm not really sure at what point that soon ended up being, but once the food came, we all practically scarfed it down because we were so hungry. I ordered the Baked Eggs with Tomato Sauce. The tomato sauce was very flavorful, but the eggs were overcooked. I was expecting a soft-boil or maybe even a little runny, but they were neither, which was a little disappointing. Not sure if that's just how they do their eggs here. In addition, they didn't even bring the focaccia out with my order and I had to ask for it.Considering the time we had to wait and the abundance of other options in the area, we probably won't be returning.",0
"I'm a fan of Gyu-Kaku! The quality and consistency of their food is there, and the prices are good too. The staff is always friendly and the tables are spaced well. They have good deals you can take advantage of via the app, like combos that can be worth it depending on what you're looking for. The food is well seasoned, and you get to cook it yourself. I love that at Gyu-Kaku you still get to grill the food yourself, which I think is a lot of fun. Highly recommend!",1
"Joe's Pizza was sooo good!! Due to its location in Times Square and popularity, be prepared for a line. However, the line moved very quickly and service was efficient. There is little seating inside but a lot of people just order pizza to go, so it's definitely possible to get a seat. The pizza itself was very good and inexpensive. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for pizza in Times Square.",0
"Holy moly this is some bomb ass pizza. Get the classic pepperoni square slice, it lives up to all the buzz and the hype. It is super damn greasy though, you can see grease just building up in the divots of the pepperoni and soaking through the box. The margherita slice is also great too, not very greasy and a nice counter to the greasy af (but still yummy) pepperoni slice",0
"Handsome Rice is a great place to go for a delicious meal. The food is fresh and the owner is very friendly. I especially enjoyed the bulgogi and galbi set, as well as the sides that came with it. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the pork mandu, but that's probably because I'm not a big fan of that type of food. Overall, I highly recommend Handsome Rice to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I had both the duck pie and the cold fried chicken at this restaurant and overall I thought the food was good. The cold fried chicken wasn't my favorite, but the duck pie was. It had a good black bean sauce that added a nice flavor to the filling. I would recommend it to others.",1
Let start with the positives. The food at this place comes in good portions and is delicious. I ate all of mine and genuinely enjoyed every bite. The frozen margaritas are also delicious. They Have a nice flavor and are mixed surprisingly well considering they are frozen. I thought the food/ drinks were on point at this place. It's was also very clean. What was lacking was everything else. We literally had to find our waitress whenever we wanted anything because she never came to check on us. The place isn't that big so you have to try hard  not to see the patrons. That's why it only gets three stars. We were not checked on at all and had to track our waitress down to order. I would visit this spot again if I was hungry and happened to be near it. Probably would grab the food to go and have a drink or two inside. But literally would be running back to eat here,0
Love this place! Excellent poke bowls. Usually order the triple bowl and end up feeling full all day. The fish and toppings taste fresh and are plentiful. Delivery is consistent and fast. They also read the instructions with sides notes for the order. Would highly recommend.,0
"I visited Nougatine for brunch with a party of seven and was really impressed. The service was attentive and the food was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the pasta and the beef tenderloin. The restaurant had ample exposure to the sun, which made it very pleasant to eat outdoors. I was also lucky to meet Alexander Wang while there. Overall, a great experience.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere was really cozy and the service was great. The only downside was that we were only able to sit at one table in the back, which was a bit frustrating because it was really crowded in the rest of the restaurant. But overall, I would definitely recommend this spot!",1
Never had a dish I didn't love. Everything here is amazing. I wish I lived closer so I could have this food more often. Their curries are vegetarian friendly as they don't use fish sauce in the curry and also delicious. My favorite dish is between red curry and pad kee mao. It can get quite busy pretty much all the time because the food is THAT good. I usually put my name down and wander around eataly while waiting for a table (they'll text you when your table is ready). One of the best Thai places in the city for sure. The ambience is nice too. Well decorated.,0
"The Tavern Onion Ring Tower was pretty good - the rings were crispy and had a good structural integrity. The Avocado Ranch Burger was also good - the avocado was a nice touch, and the burger was accompanied by a small bowl of bread and butter pickles, which our server kindly refilled. The Greens and Grains Salad was also good - the salmon was cooked well and the sweet peas were a nice touch.",1
Where was I last weekend?? Elite Williamsburg! This place is really a whole vibe an experience and I loved my time there. Upon entering I noticed that they had Instagram photo ready walls and designer logo carved watermelons at the bar. They had the social distancing little glass barriers and a rooftop with heated igloos. We had rooftop reservations for 6.Then I saw the QR code menu. I was like omg I can't wait to eat this cool food so many options I could hardly choose. I got chopped cheese empanadas and shrimp and lobster mofongo and both dishes tasted ass good as they looked in the photos. My friends did complain about the fries but the drinks were in point. My sister got a watermelon carved with Happy Birthday on it that someone had preordered as a gift. I got one. It was sparkly. LQ our hostess with the mostest was there on point EVERY single time like super customer service. They gave us the Bluetooth we played music danced and didn't feel smothered or rushed. Everyone one was like where were you. ELITE Williamsburg I tell you! And when we left I saw that it must be key to get reservations the inside was in high demand. They ppl who work there have class and just know how to throw a good brunch. Cheers to them. The bathroom was modern and clean. Everyone had in masks and gloves.,0
"I thought the food was good, but the service was poor. Our waiter was rushing us and the building needed to be closed for repairs, so I wasn't able to use the bathroom when I wanted to after a certain time. Otherwise, the food was good.",1
"I stopped by Poke Place last night and I have to say, the interior is so cute! The aesthetic really makes the place feel like home. I tried the yuzu salmon bowl and everyone else tried the spicy tuna bowl. I think I liked my Yuzu salmon bowl the best. The avocado was a nice touch and really made the bowl stand out. The salmon was cooked very well and the flavor profile was pleasing. The spicy tuna bowl wasn't too spicy and the flavor profile wasn't quite to my liking, but I think my friends also felt the same way. Overall, I had a great experience at Poke Place and I would definitely come back for poke. The cleanliness and freshness of the restaurant was a big plus!",1
"I ordered delivery from here last night while at work and I was really impressed with the Tartufo. It was amazing! The whip cream in the center was so delicious and the fresh berries added a nice touch. The chocolate outer shell was also really crunchy. The calzone was also decent, but I was disappointed that there wasn't much pepperoni in the center. The marinara to dip it in was also ok. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Miznon is a decent Mediterranean street food style option within the Hudson Yards mall (4th floor), though it could be improved. The burger pita I got was a bit boring/plain, as it was just a pita with a burger patty, cheese, and a few pickles inside. The cheese came in the form of a large cheddar crisp, which was kind of burned. However, the pita itself was soft and fluffy. $14.50 was a fair price for this.

The restaurant has a bunch of tables for seating and is clean and aesthetic (and not to be confused with the more expensive Naked Tomato next door). The staff are friendly and the service speed is fine. Overall, Miznon is a pretty good option for Mediterranean food if you are already planning to be at Hudson Yards, but I might not venture all the way up here just to eat here. That being said, I should note that I took my pita for take-away, so that certainly didn't help the quality. I would give Miznon three stars (more like 3.5 stars).",1
"I had a great time trying out this restaurant. The atmosphere is really moody and unique, and the service was really great - they had a lot of knowledge about the dishes and the chefs. I wasn't a huge fan of a lot of the dishes, but the breakfast taco and the crudo were definitely stand out. The only downside is that I'm not really a fan of food that needs a lot of seasoning, so some of the dishes were a bit too much for me. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"This is the first time I've had Ippudo outside of Asia. And unfortunately the standard was not the same as Japan or even Singapore.The original ramen was bland and very average, wasn't a fan of how the the pork hirata were seasoned, and the hamachi carpaccio was missing the ingredient that makes something taste ok vs. great. I think the American expansions lost sight of its Japanese rootsWould recommend many of the other delicious and authentic Japanese spots in NYC instead!",0
"Just a short walk from Chelsea Piers, we came for a quick dinner.  They had indoor dining available and about 3 small tables outside. Their outdoor set up is no frills with no tents or decorations. Just tables on the street.  We each ordered a main course...Chicken Shish ($23): 4/5. Not bad but there really wasn't enough chicken to make it a main course. Would've been nice if they served with carbs.Artichoke Flatbread ($17): 2/5. There was a very strong cheese (?) taste. It was overwhelming and way too strong. I couldn't eat it after 2 slices.  However, the presentation was very nice and portion was big.Ricotta Meatballs: 3/5. Nothing special. It's just marinara sauce and 5 meatballs. Again, wasn't filling. We did really enjoy the complimentary pita bread.  Aside from that, I wasn't impressed at all especially for the price.  We were still hungry after. The food didn't blow our minds either.",0
"Sadly, this is by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The only positive thing I can say is that they do have a DJ. The rest of the experience was just terrible. I came here multiple times and each time it was a different experience. The first time I came, it was during Cinco de Mayo. I understand that they had to enforce the food requirement, but it was such overpriced food. The next time I came, it was late afternoon and I was seated in the outside section. The waiter explained to me that I had to order food to sit outside. I was a bit confused because the requirement to order food while having drinks has been lifted. We left the establishment without ordering anything and kindly expressed my concerns. Never going back again.",1
"I visited Gourmet 45 for lunch and was disappointed with my experience. I ordered a turkey sandwich on flatbread but received a wrap instead. The sandwich was alright, but the turkey was not fresh. The staff was friendly, but there was no place to sit down and eat. I would recommend ordering to go if you're looking for a quick meal.",1
"Via Carota is a great place to go for a romantic dinner. The atmosphere is cozy and the food is delicious. The only downside is that it can be difficult to get a reservation, but it's well worth the wait. The pancetta pasta is my favorite dish, and the fried olives are a great addition. The pork braised in milk was also very good. The tiramisu was a bit too rich for my taste, but the cake was delicious. I would definitely recommend Via Carota to anyone looking for a romantic dinner.",1
"Came here for brunch before theatre show. My party selected the bottomless drink option. Our waitress told us the frozen margarita machine was broken and continued to tell us so until we asked one of the managers if it had been fixed. He then said he would go upstairs to  get them because the upstairs machine was working. Our waitress was vague and charged us $10 for a bottle of water because she was difficult to understand. Ultimately the food and drinks were good, the food was served promptly. Would have had a better experience if our waitress was more personable and easier to understand.",0
"Ambience/Vibe: 3/5. That bamboo aesthetic prevalent in Japanese restaurants. Not enough soundproofing between tables, as we were forced to endure the loud, drunken conversation of the super basic ABGs next to us.Service: 3/5. Our server copped a major 'tude for most of our meal, for reasons unknown to me. The rest of the staff seemed friendly.Food: 3/5. It's stuff on skewers. They were out of a LOT of items, including all the seasonable vegetables. Why? In short, some hits, some misses, mostly fine but not super memorable. The Hits:- Thigh meat with yuzukosho- Chicken meatball- Heart, Gizzard- Duck breast- Asparagus, Okra- Broiled Aburi-uniThe Eh: - Breast meat with plum and shiso- Chicken and duck meatball- Rib, Pork Belly- Cioppino Onion, Shiitake, Shishito, TomatoThe Misses:- Crispy Skin Plate: not very crispy and not worth $20- Kiji-don: Too much rice, not enough chicken",0
"I was so excited to go to this restaurant after hearing my sister rave about it. However, I was a bit disappointed. The only lunch options they had were the salmon teriyaki salad bowl and the miso soup. The salmon was very tender, crispy, and buttery, but the shrimp side salad was on the wilted side. Overall, I would definitely return for dinner, but not for lunch.",1
"I had a mixed experience at Saar. The cocktails were interesting and good, and the space is nice. However, the food was disappointing. The cauliflower latkes were greasy and bland, and the chicken stuffed shrimp were bland as well. The black pepper Chennai chicken was the best dish of the three, but it was still not great. The service was polite but uninterested, even though we told them we had a 7pm show. I will try Saar again next time I'm in the area, but I'm not sure if I would come back.",1
"NYC has no shortage of pizza joints and Bleecker Street is one located right in the West Village area.  You can choose from a number of options by the slice.  I ordered the Sicilian cheese.  My slice was somewhat burnt on the crust and undercooked in the center.  The overall flavor was good.  This place gets very busy so seating can be at a premium.   Also, this is a good late night place.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded at all so this is a nice place to run to last minute without having to worry about reservations. They're doing a 10% off promo right now so be sure to take advantage of that while it's still going on!

The food was very reasonably priced, and my favorites by far were the soup dumplings. The chive and shrimp dumplings were also good. Oh, and try the sesame balls for dessert!! The only downside was that the food was a little bit salty for my taste, but overall I was very satisfied with my meal.",1
"I stopped in at Yakiniku Futago for lunch and was impressed with the menu. They had a bento box special that came with miso soup, then kimchi, rice, veggies, salad, and your choice of protein. I went with the spicy chicken thighs, and they were very good. Obviously, taking a lot longer than I would have cooked steak (which would have been a few seconds a side), they were really good. Prices were a tad high, but the ambiance is higher end, and the food quality was good. Everything was tasty. And it was nice to have a sit-down lunch with good company. The service forgot about us after we were finished, but it was hard to get the check and pay. The hallway to the bathrooms downstairs is really cool, and the restrooms were very clean and chic.",1
"I had a great experience at Felice. The ambience is fantastic - definitely worth eating in - and the food was really good too. My only complaint is that the service was not very good. We had to ask for water multiple times, and our pasta didn't come with the cauliflower we ordered. But overall, I would definitely recommend it!",1
"I was really disappointed with my lunch at Tony's on Mother's Day. The chicken parmigiana was dry and rubbery, and the veal was just plain mediocre. Unfortunately, it all made for a pretty miserable experience overall. Thankfully, the restaurant was willing to take the chicken parmigiana off the bill after I asked if we wanted to, but it was still a pretty poor showing overall. It's tough to find a good Italian restaurant in New York these days, and I'm not sure Tony's is up to the task.",1
"Javelina is a great restaurant with delicious food and friendly staff. The drinks are expensive, but they're worth it. I especially love their enchiladas. They're packed with flavor and very fresh. The queso is my favorite dish here, and I would definitely recommend the Bob Armstrong queso.",1
"I love this restaurant! The crowd is upscale but not snobby or too clubby. It's counterpart, Mr. Chow is much more stuffy. The food has been consistently good over the last 10 years, definitely worth the price. The only downside is that they've recently changed some of the menu items, the veal lo mein is now just vegi (cheaper but still good) and there isn't a dessert menu (craving the red velvet cake!!!) However, I found out they were open via postmates and 1000% worth it. Some items have changed, but the food is still delicious. I highly recommend checking them out!",1
Never had any problems with anything that I get from here. Portions are plentiful;You can get it all here: some of my favorites include.Chicken Wings1/2 Chicken TostonesBeef and broccoli Egg RollShrimp RollHouse special Lo MeinFriesFired Rice Sista always takes care of her customers!!,0
"I used to come here all the time and I'm racking my brain trying to figure out why I stopped. (I had a baby, but like, girls still gotta eat.). We came in about 30 minutes before the kitchen closed on a Friday night, and if you ever want to test the service of a place, that's the way to do it. Often times service suffers as staff try to hustle to leave as early as possible, or they are visibly annoyed that you're there and ignore you. Our server was wonderful. I wish I had asked his name, but if management is reading, he is super tall with clean cut facial hair. At any rate, he was attentive and made sure we had a good time.

All of our food was fantastic. We ordered the Scotch egg, and wow! It was everything we hoped and dreamed for. (Yes, my hopes and dreams are mostly food based. I said what I said.) The lamb burger was absolutely perfect, as were the fries. The ambiance and decor are on point in this place too. We can't wait to come back.",1
"I stopped by Athens Gourmet Snack Bar for a quick snack and I was really impressed.Everything looked delicious and I'm sure I would have been happy with just a mini spanakopita, but I was also drawn in by the enticing array of Greek snacks. The spinach pies were delicious! I'm definitely looking forward to returning and trying more of the menu.",1
"""Fancy Peruvian""Of course this is going to be upscale.  It's in the Public House.  And usually hard to find fancy Peruvian, in fact, I can't think of another place.  Having been to Peru, I can say this food isn't really authentic, but who cares?  It's a change from the mundane and a good option as a pre-dinner spot.What's good:- Good ceviche - Tasty and unique cocktails What's not:- A little pricey- Pretentious- Odd seating arrangementThis is a super interesting and fun option in this area",0
"I ordered delivery from this restaurant, and it was nothing to write home about. The pumpkin curry with crispy duck was basic and the duck was quite sad. Only a few pumpkin inside. The prik khing with chicken was not bad, interesting, little salty. But the curry puff was not much meat inside. Overall, it was just a typical meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The vibe and service were great. The only downside was the food and drinks. I ordered the brunch french toast and mimosa (tried all 3 flavors) and my friend ordered the pancakes and some spritz drink. The French toast was cold with no flavor and slightly burnt which made it hard to cut/chew. Almost like they were made hours earlier and reheated. The pancakes were very salty, and this is coming from a person who likes salt. The drinks had a weird seltzer taste to them. Definitely not just OJ and champagne for the mimosa. I didn't try my friend's drink but she was not a fan and didn't drink more than 3 sips of it. I would give the place a second chance, but not for brunch again.",1
"Sal & Carmine's Pizza is a pretty forgettable spot on a stretch of the avenue with quite a few pizza places. The manager is pretty nice (I bumped into him when I was here, and he let me try some of his own hot sauce), but I couldn't really say how this place is any different from any other pizza joint in the neighborhood. Frankly, I'm having a hard time remembering how the pizza tasted exactly even though it was only a few weeks ago that I was here, so I think this rating is just about right.",1
"I visited this restaurant last week and really enjoyed my time there. The drinks at their happy hour (4-7pm) are affordable and delicious, and the food was great too. I ordered the mussels ($28) and the onion soup ($18) and both were really good. The onion soup was especially delicious, with a creamy texture and plenty of flavor. The mussels were also very good, with a nice and creamy texture and a lot of flavor. The service at the restaurant was great, and everyone was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others, and I look forward to returning soon.",1
"I had a great experience at Covid 19! The restaurant was quite busy, but they were able to accommodate me and my party quite well. The menu is extensive, with lots of options to choose from. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The only downside was that it was quite cold inside, but that's to be expected during a snow storm.",1
"Solid food and lots of vegetarian/vegan options. It's a bit overpriced, in my opinion, given that you'll need at least 3 tacos/quesadillas for a meal. There are a smattering in barstools for scarfing down your food, or take your chances finding a spot at the communal food hall tables. There's signage about happy hour being 4-7pm, but no info on what that entails. My 6pm quesadilla was full price, so maybe it's a drink special? I didn't notice any alcohol, but was very intrigued by the horchata iced coffee.",0
"I had a good time at Morimoto but Momosan was a bit of a miss. HITS:- Pork Gyoza - Spicy Dan Dan Ramen- Spicy Vegan Miso RamenMISSES: - Softshell Crab Bao - Tsukemen Ramen

CUSTOMER SERVICE: It was okay... a bit inconsistent and controlling with the seating even when there was plenty of space in the restaurant. One of the parties was told to move to another table while in the middle of their meal.",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. The atmosphere was really cool, and the food was quite good. The only downside was that the service was quite poor - we had to wait quite a while for our food and the manager only came to give us a check once. However, the food was so good that it made up for it.",1
"3.5/5, rounded down because of the not-great value. Food ranged from so-so to pretty tasty, but wouldn't necessarily recommend or return.We ordered several tapas to share, including three pintxos (foie gras terrine, sofrito topped with quail egg, and deviled crab), octopus carpaccio, the ham and shrimp ""gnocchi"", and the seared beef cheek. The three orders of pintxos (small slice of bread topped with various items) only came with two bites each, so if you're dining out with a larger group, the cost of these add up quite quickly (each ranged from $8-10). My favorite of the three was the foie gras terrine (although it's hard to mess up foie). The seared beef cheek was also very tasty and tender - this one actually came as a generous portion size. My least favorite dish of the night was the octopus carpaccio. The octopus was sliced so thinly, that it barely had any texture or existence in one's mouth, and they overdid it on the olive oil.We also got one of the cakes to share for dessert, but it tasted like something that had been sitting in a fridge for a while.",0
"Overall, the restaurant has a great atmosphere and the service is great. The presentation of the food is pretty and makes the experience more enjoyable, but nothing tasted memorable. My husband and I ordered set 2, set c x 2 and a couple of extra pieces, and it all tasted fine/normal. Just sashimi with sauces here and there. It didn't seem like the flavors complimented each other nor did it clash. It was simply just sauce mixed with fish. It's a cute date spot if you're looking for something new in the sushi department, but you can definitely get a better sushi experience and money's worth elsewhere in NYC.",1
"I had a great time catching up with a friend for lunch at this Vietnamese restaurant. The outdoor seating is great, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend ordering take out so you can enjoy it in your own home. The only downside is that the seating is not the best, and there are a lot of mosquitoes around.",1
"I just found this great deal at this pizzeria! You get two cheese slices and any can of soda or water for only 2.99. The slices that aren't cheese are still very inexpensive, and the crust is nice and doughy. I give it 4 stars! There are no restrooms, but the indoor and outdoor seating is great. The only downside is that they don't have any parmesan cheese outside for your pizza.",1
"After living in New York for 11 years I finally visited Cafe Katja...Sat outside on a Sunday evening, the street was quiet and chill. Our waiter was cute and friendly.tried the Bratwurst - I'm just not a sausage person I guess, but I love the sauerkraut that came with it.Weiner Schnitzel - I'm a big schnizel fan, the buttered sauce came with it was so fatty but yummy with the schnitzel. (However for the crispiness I still love Shoo Shoo's Schnitzel more...oops)",0
"Great lunch special and all you can eat Indian buffet. I refilled my plate twice and was completely stuffed. I think the buffet was $15, which is great considering everything that is included. They even bring out fresh naan to the table. @traveleen_gurl",0
"Wow .... #PrinceStreet Pizza makes a fantastic Spicy Spring Square--that pepperoni is full of flavor, super cheesy, and i loved how thick and perfectly cooked it was. The hype is real. The line of people waiting should not deter you from staying. They move quickly and efficiently. They take cash or credit. There is no seating available but there is a little room to stand and eat for those that do not want to eat outside. I got lucky and found some counter space.  My friend and I split the margarita slice, which was good, but I was still on cloud 9 with that Spicy spring pie. I'm not even a big pepperoni person but this was great stuff! It was worth waiting and I can't wait to return to do it again!",0
"There are way too many places to go in New York that can give you a true experience and has delicious food than Applebee's. My close friend and I ended up here because she wanted to hurry up and eat, well since there was a wait she was down. They offer breakfast until 12 so we ordered breakfast meals. Mine was a pancake entree and she also order a pancake entree but with a egg scramble dish as well. The process for ordering the food wasn't bad. During the wait that's when you start to see how inappropriate the employees are when customers are right there. They are pointing at people discussing sections, talking about their personal stuff loudly, cracking jokes about some of their customers in Spanish (didnt think they realize there's several people that know Spanish) and drinking soft drinks while right by the customers. I think there needs to be some training put into place for the employees to show them how to conduct themselves during work hours. When the food arrived, everything seemed to be correct. The food was decent, I ordered something simple to make sure it was mess up proof and they sure didn't mess it up so good job! All in all I would not recommend Applebee's because it's a nationwide chain and you should come to New York and explore new options. This location has some hang-ups but with proper training they can get better.",0
"Like most of the reviews here my overall experience was good, however: the pricing on food is 30% too high. The quality of food is ok, the waitstaff is helpful and friendly and I know it's NYC and all and $15hr an hour needs to come from somewhere. Ambiance C+Decor D-Food B+Staff A-",0
"Dim Sum Palace is a great spot to go with friends and order different items off the dim sum menu. It lets you try a lot of different dishes, so I was able to try 4 different menu items. I ended up really enjoying every dish and would definitely recommend it to others. The pork and thousand year old egg congee was my favorite, but every dish was good. The service was really efficient, and I was seated right when I arrived.",1
"I had a great time on my recent trip back to my favorite lobster boat in New York City. The $10 fee to get on is definitely worth it, as you get a bracelet to check you in and enjoy the ride without having to worry about spending money on food or drinks. The lobster roll was delicious and generously sized, and the boat itself is really beautiful and well-maintained. I definitely recommend this experience to anyone looking for a fun and relaxing evening out.",1
For the most part this was a great experience. The food was hit when it arrived and it came quickly. My food was correct and good. Portions were also a nice size. I do wish there was more flavor in the lo mein but otherwise it was good. I'll order again,0
"Just Salad is a restaurant I generally love, but I was really disappointed with my experience at their outpost in my area. The chicken and rice were completely dried out, and the rice was crunchy. The flavors were bland and uninspiring, and I won't be returning to this location.",1
"I had a negative experience at this restaurant - the Short Rib dish was disappointing and I developed stomach pains after eating there. The aesthetics and menu drew me in, but I would not recommend this spot based on my experience. The portions are small and I think it would be better to try some of the small plates instead. The only positive thing about this restaurant was the gentleman who took my reservation.",1
"I recently visited Gramercy Kitchen, and I have to say that I absolutely loved it! The location was great, and the speed in which we were served was absolutely amazing. I decided to go for the sausage omlete with the home fries and English muffin. The omlete was absolutely delicious, and I couldn't believe how much cheese was in it! I also ordered a cookies and cream milkshake, and I must say that it was absolutely delicious. I was a bit worried about the price, though, because it was a bit on the expensive side. However, the milkshake was actually really good and definitely worth the price. The bathrooms were unisex, and they were both really clean. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Gramercy Kitchen, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",1
"You will almost never hear me complain about a broth being too strong, especially too seafood-strong, but this one... they have to make sure the shrimp they're using for the prawn mee broth are very fresh, because it tasted a little old-shrimp to me. And I'm not talking about dried shrimp, or shrimp paste, or any of the ways shrimp are supposed to be when they're not fresh. I just mean shrimp that's a little past where it should be. If the shrimp had been fresher, this broth would have been AMAZING.As it was, it was still tasty, and the pork slices were heavenly little sheets of melt in your mouth goodness, and the noodles soaked up the shrimp broth in a way that was pleasant and not seafood-bomby like the broth straight.We also got char kuey teow. No blood cockles again - damn. (Does ANYWHERE in the US have blood cockles??) But aside from some overcooked squid, the flavor was really good, really charred, tasting straight from a well seasoned wok.",0
"I was really excited to try this restaurant during restaurant week, but unfortunately my experience was not great. The fried oysters were delicious, but the rest of the meal was disappointing. The short rib was small and bland, and the chocolate flan was disappointing - it was dry and flavorless. The service was amazing, but I don't think the food was worth the price. I would not recommend this restaurant, and I am not sure if I would return.",1
"I really enjoyed my lunch at Burger 1 today! The small restaurant had a homey atmosphere and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I was able to order my tacos however I wanted, and they were just the right amount of spicy for me. The double shells of corn were a nice touch, and the location was great for quick and easy access. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick and affordable meal!",1
"Came back for a bowl of ramen and boy were they busy. They seemed completely disorganized and multiple customers were upset over delayed orders. We dined in and also waited quite a while for our food. I decided to try the spicy miso ramen and it was just meh. Other than the spice, the broth didn't have much flavor or depth (almost felt like maybe an ingredient was missing)? I'm glad to see that they're busy but I do hope they can spruce up their operations a bit!",0
"Highly recommend this amazing Burger Joint! You will love the amazing service, and awesome food.Thank you to the super amazing staff that has given me, family and friends the best service for over 12 years!Special thanks to Cefar, Tashima, and Jeff, these 3 staff members are the rockstars of the restaurant!The burgers are beef or plant based char grilled, made fresh to order, and you can have the works on your burger. The fries are potato or sweet potato.This legendary historical spot has a lot of history! Every celebrity you can think of has signed their name on the wall, from: Howard Stern, Iron Mike Tyson, Piers Morgan, Ringo Starr (The Beatles), Rhianna, 50 Cent, the list goes on! The red curtain was placed to separate the restaurant from the fancy Le Parker Meridian hotel. This was the cool place to eat burgers late night.",0
"Marg check: first they care about the turtles and it came with a straw, A+. The pineapple mezcal drink was delicious. Riley and I guzzled 3 each. Did she hit on an Amherst lax bro 10 mins later at Vics, absolutely. Am I happy it wasn't me, 100%. Would I drink 3 again, in a heartbeat. Riley ditched him no bros were slept with in the making of this review The food always makes me feel healthy. There's rarely a wait and it's a safe space from the mothers ruin crowd. They haven't figured out how to walk this direction without chasing 4 Emily's to the butchers daughter",0
"We stayed at the hotel next door, we walked by this place everyday. I figured bar food that would be okay. Monday night around 8 pm. We were tired and hungry so let's just try this establishment. The place was pretty quiet so we were seated immediately and water was poured. Super friendly server, amd the bar has Empress gin. The drinks were well made. I saw on the menu a mac and cheese burger. The red flag for me was Instagram worthy. I'm thinking nice presentation no flavor. I took the bait and decided to order it. It's a giant beef patty a disk of fried Mac and cheese and Mac and cheese. The not fried mac and cheese is flowing out of the burger. I use a for and scoop up a bite full. The my happy surprise the mac and cheese had great flavor. It was cheesy and seasoned well. Overall the burger was great. The fries were crispy on the outside soft on the inside. My wife, at the servers suggestion, opted for the hanger steak burger. She loved it. The bite I had, tasted more like a steak with deep rich flavor. The jalapeños were a nice touch of heat to help cut through the richness. My daughter had the boneless wings. The Buffalo sauce was solid. Overall it was a good meal.",0
"Llama San is a great spot for brunch. The entrees could use some refinement, but the desserts and appetizers are both amazing. The tea is a little pricey, but the tea pots are really beautiful. Service is a bit rough around the edges, but it's new so I'm sure they'll get it sorted out. I would definitely come back!",1
"Extremely disappointed in Pig and Khao's service. I was able to book a table for four hoping to try their restaurant week brunch menu. When we got seated, they gave us a regular menu while the table to the left of us had restaurant week menu and did not order food yet. I asked the waiter who told me that the kitchen closes in an hour and I can't order from restaurant week menu but only regular menu. Puzzled by it, I asked what's the difference because either way the kitchen will have to cook. I also pointed out that the table next to us has the restaurant week menu but did not seem to order yet. The waiter didn't know how to respond and said he'll ask the manager. Then he came back shortly with the same response that I would have to order from the regular menu. I was taken back by it because when making reservation, they did not specify it and was well within the time listed for brunch hours as advertised for restaurant week. This is a conflict of information and hopefully Pig and Khao will rectify it for the future so that it doesn't shy customers away.",0
"I really wanted to love the place, but I just couldn't :(I made a last minute reservation for Saturday night and did not have any issues. The restaurant is very, very tiny and cramped. You will be seated inches away from another party..They first start off with a complimentary bite sized fried puff served with something like an everything bagel seasoning cream cheese. It was nice and crunchy... pretty good..Snow Crab Noodles... $34.00... it tasted fine - pasta was cooked well and texture was good. the dish has a very light flavor but still feels heavy, so we shared this as an appetizer. This is something I would eat again if offered, but it was nothing phenomenal. I overheard the waiter saying how much he loved this dish and how it's the best dish ever, but I didn't understand the hype. Pig Out for Two - $61.0010 cubes of stringy pork belly with crispy skin - definitely not as tender as I expected, a little on the drier side.I was extremely disappointed with this dish because there's nothing I tasted that could justify the price I paid for this. I would have much preferred the standard pork they serve at Chinese restaurants..The side of peanut noodles this dish comes with is good though, even better than the noodles from the crab dish.Overall, I just think that this restaurant was over hyped and pricey. Nothing was bad about any of the dishes, but nothing (not even the signature dishes) was mind-blowing or amazing either.",0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The outdoor seating was really warm and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly. The wine menu is a bit pricier than we would have liked, but the complimentary bread was a nice touch. Our starters were both great, and we especially loved the roasted mushroom app. For our main courses, we both enjoyed the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti and the duck and foie gras ravioli. The short rib was especially delicious, and the portions were both very generous. The only downside was that we didn't have enough room to try the crème fraiche panna cotta, but we're definitely looking forward to returning to try that!",1
"I had a great time at this pizza spot! The atmosphere is young, hip, and yummy, and the pizza options are colorful and unique. The crust is a thick focaccia-y base layer with various toppings covering it. I tried a slice of the Carbonara and a Margherita. The Carbonara was quite oily, with some bacon on top and shredded cheese. I found it to be too dry and heavy. The Margherita however, had a great balance of flavors! The red sauce was tasty and well flavored and meshed well with a chewier cheese and basil on top. I'd definitely come back for that.",1
"Excited to see some Vietnamese food in Chinatown, I had some high hopes in Nha Trang One! However, when I got my Thai Tea and my banh cuon, I was deeply disappointed! The Thai Tea stated it would be mixed with condensed milk, so I expected it to be very sweet. However, one sip in, and it was already tasting diluted? For how quick the Thai Tea was made, I am surprised it tasted so watered down already! The flavor wasn't even sweet, unlike regular Thai Tea. The banh cuon also came out quickly, but it was steaming hot! I actually expected the dish to be cool or at least temperate, but it was HOT. The inside also was tasteless, so all it felt like I was eating was bland and steamy rice rolls. I had to drown my food in some fish sauce in order to down the food. Deeply disappointed, I would not come back here again nor recommend Nha Trang One to anyone.",0
"This is located right near the Cloisters, which is why all of my coworkers and I ended up dining here for lunch. The service was not that great. We had a reservation and came in on time. We all stood in the doorway waiting to be seated and no one came to greet us for a solid 5 minutes. Once we got sat, our server tried to take all of our drink orders but kept forgetting the individual orders. If you have to keep repeating to us what we ordered, I mean like 3 times, you should probably excuse yourself and get a pen and pencil. The drinks came, and they were just OK. Nothing really interesting. The margaritas on the rocks were quite strong ( not complaining about that though, wink wink.) After flagging down our server, we were able to order our meals. The food was again a tad lack-luster. I ordered the enchiladas. I wasn't impressed. The only item I did try from my coworker's plate that was a notch above the rest was a shrimp dish, everything else was bland. Overall, unimpressed. I don't plan on being in this part of town anytime soon and won't be back. 2/5",0
"I went to Churutto this evening for dinner and while the food was pretty good, the service was very slow. Ramen doesn't normally take that long. The broth is already cooked (they advertised that it was cooked for up to 8 hours), the noodles only take a few minutes to make, and the toppings are typically prepared in advance. The frustrating thing was that other people arrived after us and their ramen came out before ours. I would have given Churutto four stars had the food not taken as long. Anyway, on to the food.

Ordered:

Chicken buns ($6)- I enjoyed the chicken buns. It had crispy karaage, a slice of cucumber and a spicy mayo and a brown sauce. There were three chicken pieces in each bun. It was hard to pick it up and eat the bun because some of the chicken would fall out, but the flavors worked well together.

Chicken ramen ($13.50)- the broth was a salty and creamy chicken broth, it had pieces of chopped dark meat chicken, al dente noodles, nori, spinach and a soft boiled egg. I'd order this dish again. I may give Churutto another chance",1
"I returned to the restaurant for lunch yesterday and was not disappointed!  The weather was perfect and the patio was very comfortable.  The food was as good as I remembered and the timing was off only by a little bit. I ordered a tuna tartare with an avocado puree and razor thin, sliced radishes, a slightly crispy skinned black bass with artichokes, and a strawberry rhubarb pie with strawberry sorbet. All of the food was delicious and I was particularly impressed with the tuna tartare. The only drawback was that the wait for our food was a little long, but overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The prices have gone up since I was last here, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.",1
"I've been a fan of by Chloe for quite some time so when I heard they were opening a location closer to my office I knew I had to go. Ventured over with a friend/coworker around noon and found quite a few people waiting for their food. You can either order on a kiosk or with a person. We opted for the latter but the next time I'll try the kiosk.Staff is friendly. They took our orders quickly. The sweet treats are in a display at the counter. They do not accept cash. They do not print receipts. Take out orders line the side wall in alphabetical order. It's honestly a well-oiled machine and they are totally in their groove here.I had the classic burger with sweet potato fries. The food is made to order so yes there is a wait but it's worth it. My burger was delicious and the fries sealed the deal. If they weren't so expensive I could easily do a vegan meal at least once a week from here. Sucks that ""healthy"" food has to be so pricey. I guarantee half the people waiting are not vegan and that shows how awesome this place is.Definitely a grab and go type spot. No tables or chairs at this location. Now if only they would join the MealPal train.",0
"The only open restaurant on Christmas day, we had to come here. Ordered steak and eggs, French toast, and egg Benedict. The steak and eggs were great quality, and the egg Benedict was alright. The French toast was overdone and charred, though. Service was a bit slow due to the holiday, but standard for a diner.",1
"had a solid experience here last night! despite it being a weekend we were seated pretty quickly, be prepared as the restaurant features a few big tables that you're seated at with other parties of people. the food came out super quickly which was great, my friends raaaaaved about the pork soup dumplings, highly recommend the scallion pancake tooas a veggie i wasn't crazy about the vegetarian selection, but the waiter was more than happy to accommodate my dietary restrictions and had the singapore chow mei fun made with egg and veggies for me - SO goodsuch a great place to sit down or take out, a must try for sure",0
"Dim Sum Go Go is a great place for dim sum lovers! They have a great variety of dumplings and I especially enjoyed the beef curry dumpling. The prices are also very reasonable, making it a great option for budget-minded diners. The service is also very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend Dim Sum Go Go to anyone looking for a good dim sum experience in the area.",1
"I've always passed by this place and thought the banner was cool but never realized how well known this spot is! I came on a Sunday at around 1:30ish and was able to be seated immediately.The atmosphere of this place is so unique! The restaurant is basically a long row of single seat booths with dividers set up between the people sitting next to you. The ordering process is pretty simple: you choose between classic tonkotsu (meat) vs veggie and then customize your ramen according to your personal liking. I went with the classic tonkotsu with all the recommended customizations and ordered the additional topping set. Ramen isn't my favorite Japanese cuisine but having Ichiban's ramen got me swayed otherwise. The noodles were so fresh (definitely could tell they're made in house) and the broth was so hearty without falling to the trap that most ramen places with oily remnants. Personally, I think you can skip out of the toppings set. I only ordered it because I thought that's how you get the chashu but chashu IS included in the ramen and the set just has extra pieces. While I enjoyed my experience, I feel like this may just be one of those occasional places for me. For $18.90 + the $5 I spent on the topping set, this ramen is on the pricey side and I can't see myself coming here leisurely anytime I'm craving ramen. However, wouldn't mind coming back for an occasion to show my friends who haven't been yet!",0
"Pizza and Shakes has so many pizza toppings, it's unbelievable. Not to mention, they make their pizzas so quickly! Was so impressed by the impeccable service, huge variety of toppings, and delicious food! There was a huge group of people in line before us, but we were helped very quickly. Here's what we got:~Quatreto Pizza (white garlic sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, fresh mozzarella, parmesan cheese, garlic parmesan sauce) and I added to it meatballs, bacon, and chicken. ~Make your own pizza with classic basil tomato sauce, Italian sausage, bacon, meatball, cherry tomato, olives, shredded mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and garlic parmesan ~Parmesan cheese twists (they were so crispy and when you ripped them apart, there was such a satisfying cheese pull!)Both pizzas were COVERED in toppings, so they were nice and filling. The garlic parmesan sauce was so delicious, I could truly put it on everything! Dessert:~Cone with Ferrero Rocher gelato and banana Nutella gelato~Ferrero Rocher gelato milkshake with OreosThere were so many awesome flavors to choose from!If you're looking for an amazing pizza with all the toppings or some quality gelato, this is the place to go!!",0
"This was fine but certainly wouldn't stop in again. Currently it's either takeout or being served (loose term since they barely do anything). The jamon iberico was decent and scratched an itch. Calamari was some of the worst/fishiest tasting calamari I've ever had and not served with any sauce. Patatas bravas were ok, but again pretty underwhelming compared to others. We did enjoy the G&T and sangria though. Also we ordered water twice on the app and asked 3 servers before it ever came (after we finished all of the food) - bleh. Cool concept and has potential but the execution was terrible.",0
"Sunday brunch at Salon Salon was lovely! The service was impeccable, friendly and patient with my friends child. The food was amazing and the drinks were great, too. Probably one of the best French fries I've ever had (perfect salty). We also ordered a few things from the menu, such as eggs in hell, Burrata, Cacio e Pepe, and Skirt steak. All servings were great, with some items having veggies or carbs, so you may need to order those separately. The pancakes were also delicious - the apple pancakes! We will definitely be back to eat brunch at Salon Salon.",1
"Again another place that doesn't live upto the hype around it. It wasn't all bad but could have been much better.We went there for Saturday brunch with high expectations. The menu looked promising and we were excited to try it. We started with mimosa (no complaints there) and ordered a few chips with classic hummus and paprika hummus. Normally would expect a mediterranean place to have some flavor but to our disappointment, the paprika was flavorless.. well fine that's forgivable as it was just an appetizer..Next we ordered our mains; My shakshuka can be described in three words; plain, sweet and under cooked. ITwo of my friends ordered 'menemen eggs' and were sorely disappointed.. it was under cooked eggs in sweet tomato sauce.. they had to add paprika to make it tolerable for their taste buds.Only happy person on the table was another friend who ordered steaks (Thank god they didn't go wrong with that)We left our brunch a tad bit disappointed and somewhat annoyed. Went to nearby Thelewala to get some nizami rolls to make up for the disappointing brunch. Perhaps this place is better for their dinner menu..they really need to up their brunch game,",0
"I do not know why I got my hopes up thinking this would be a nice authentic sushi place in Chinatown. Of course it was operated by Chinese people. What was I thinking?



To be honest, it wasn't that bad. Ambiance and decor is very nice but I feel like I was paying for that more than for the food itself.



Now onto the food reviews. The price was a bit high for the portion provided (for everything). The fish I had was pretty fresh, cannot complain but I've had better. Rice was nothing special. The kani salad was unexpectedly spicy and as I have already mentioned, small. It also had a hint of (I believe) lime. Was not a fan. Fried squid legs, not very crunchy.



Given the price AND quality, I would just go to Sugarfish. As for the fried squid legs, I would go to chicken v. Unfortunately the one in Chinatown is still closed though. Would I go back? Sorry but no.",1
"A Thai-me to remember :) Ordered: (everything was soooo good so I recommend it all) - Pad see ew: my favorite Thai comfort dish and they did it well! - beef dish from the privileged section of the menu: unfortunately don't remember the name of this dish but it was very unique and I highly recommend if you like spicy curries! The beef was tender, the flavor was fragrant and the dish included longan (which is like a lychee) and potato chips for texture - **my favorite dish of the night** moo pork chop: grilled pork lovers unite! The flavor on this pork chop was incredible - so juicy and flavorful (now I want it again). The addition of the coconut sticky rice paired really well with the savory meat Additional pros:- the waitstaff is super kind and helpful. They're great about checking in on you even when the restaurant is busy- complimentary shot glass of soup at the beginning- interior!!!! Nothing like it, it's cozy and beautiful Tip:- long wait so utilize the yelp waitlist!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was amazing and the prices were reasonable. The waiter was very nice and the hostess was great. I especially love the menu options and the variety of food they have. I would definitely rate this restaurant 5 stars but the bathrooms could use some improvement. Overall, I had a great experience and I'll be back!",1
"Very unique Thai restaurant but quality of food wasn't exceptional and not worth the price you pay in my opinion. The mussels were just okay, sauce did not really hit you with any incredible flavors - prob would not get again. Pad see ew was standard (can never really go wrong) and the fried chicken was good but not mind blowingly juicy or anything. The fries were very good. Overall, pricier than your usual Thai place with smaller portions.",0
"Note: This review is for the Vegetarian option. This place was strongly recommended by my friendly pharmacist, Dr. Ali, whose pharmacy is close to Brodo, and whose recommendation was part of his prescription for me to heal from my respiratory infection. I have passed by this place many times. As a vegetarian, I can't have the bone broth but let me get their vegetarian special which was parmesan cream and leek. I asked for fresh ginger as recommended.  For this cup, I paid around $10. The gal was not friendly and I literally saw her assemble it:hot waterbroth powderleekparmesan sauce She did not put the fresh ginger and immediately closes the separator window. For some reason, it rubs me off the wrong way. There is no thank you from her part and the tablet register expects one to tip 20% or more for this subpar performance. When I arrived home, I anticipated a one of a kind experience. What I had was a very lackluster soup that lacked the flavor, taste, or any culinary art. At least for the vegetarian option. It is not worth the $10 and I regret not going to Mee's for very satisfying Chinese food at the same price.  I know friends who are hooked by the Brodo and they must get the bone one which I assume is tastier. A Lipton instant soup surpasses it by 1000% because it has flavor, taste, and it surpasses the expectation of a supermarket soup. And its much friendlier to my pocket book. This experience is added to my chapter of ""Once is Enough!""",0
"I visited the restaurant's Manhattan location, and I have to say that the food was delicious. However, I didn't enjoy my experience at all. I ordered the Vegetarian Ginger Beef Bowl, and I found that the ginger flavor was too strong. Additionally, the vegetables didn't seem very fresh to me. I'm not sure if I'll be back to this restaurant in the future.",1
"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The prices are very reasonable for what you get, and the atmosphere is very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the large screen TVs scattered around the bar - it made for a great place to watch a football game or soccer match. The only downside to my experience was that the food wasn't particularly great. However, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing evening out with friends or family.",1
"Unlike Table 87, a Shark Tank business I did not care for, Cousins Mains Lobster stays true to its Maine roots without any compromises. Real Estate mogul Barbara Corcoran invested in this company because she felt they had a great product (the owners of the business are also two nice looking men), calling it, ""a runaway hit"".Yes, this is very much like Luke's Lobster, but I think this one offers more, in a sense you do not need to ask for a pickle if you want one. You get one included with your roll! Okay maybe more also in the figurative sense too. I tried both their traditional Maine lobster roll and Connecticut roll (only difference is the lobster meat is warmed on the latter); there is plenty of lobster meat on both rolls, and the lobster meat is absolutely excellent in quality. The New England split roll it is served on is pretty good too.Both rolls are served with coleslaw as well as with the pickle, but the slaw is very bland and dry. It is to be expected, as the restaurant is not called Cousins Maine Coleslaw, it is Cousins Maine Lobster!There are other items they serve in their brick and mortar, like salads and other entrees, which I think detract a bit from the whole experience. I tried their lobster bisque and it is rich! Please do not eat this out unless you have a strong stomach or plan on being near a restroom when you eat this.Otherwise, I think Barbara got this one right.",0
"Stopped by for brunch with my SO, sister, and her partner. We came before christmas because it showed up on a link for decorated NYC bars/restaurants. The decorations were definitely pleasant, but the food was slow to come out and not incredibly impressive. I ordered the impossible burger off the regular menu. It was very average. Others ordered the eggs Benedict or English breakfast. No one found anything problematic about the food or drinks, there just wasn't anything especially positive about them either. If you're looking for a bar with a christmassy feel (or one that will tell you a bit about Churchill via speech clips in the bathroom) then you should stop by. If looking for a fantastic meal, maybe skip this one.",0
"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The service was excellent and the interiors were beautiful. They constantly brought water and refilled our sake, which was great. The half bottle of sake was kept nice and chilled in a nice, cool contraption. They were also good about providing extra utensils for sharing. The mapo tofu was well seasoned, and the cabbage with glass noodles was a great dish. The truffle fried rice was excellent, and the black sesame soup dumpling was incredible. What I appreciated the most was that it wasn't too sweet. The bathrooms are very well appointed, which is rare for restaurant bathrooms. Overall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay. The drinks were good, but the atmosphere was pretty basic. The only real draw for me was the view, but I didn't feel like the price was worth it.",1
"This restaurant is great! The atmosphere is lively and the decor is nice and colorful. The live music adds a special touch. They have great happy hour deals and super friendly staff. I've had many of the menu items but on my most recent visit I ordered the tour of Havana. It's pernil (roast pork), Ropa vieja (braised beef) and chicharrones (fried chicken)---I had rice and beans as a side. I loved the presentation of this Dish and it was lots of food for a reasonable price. I do not regret ordering this. Can't wait to go back!",1
This place is so convenient to order! You order at an iPad kiosk which makes it easy to change your order or look at what's in each item. Being a dimsum place you order w couple of each like a tapas place. The service is really quick and they also have to go containers and sauces available in case you order too much like I did. I also highly recommend a hot tea to go with your meal!,0
"We decide to come in & check this place out after walking around the area. It was a warm day out so we just stuck to water this time around. Appetizers we got the Mozzarella della casa , fresh mozzarella with chopped tomatoes , basil & bruschetta this was great , nice tasting mozzarella all together was very good. Main dishes we went with the Capellini di Pomodoro angel hair pasta with basil, olive oil , garlic & marinara this was very good, great tasting sauce & pasta. We also had the Pollo Scarpariello boneless chicken , sausage & potatoes in a white wine & olive oil sauce  nice tasting chicken dish went well with the pasta. Decent looking place, service was good & prices were not bad we enjoyed our meal.",0
"Of all the pizza places I been to on my trips to NYC, which isn't many, this is by far the best one.   Several reasons for this too.  1.  I love pizza   2. It was IMHO cheap  and 3. it was hella close to the hotel I was staying at.Its is the picture perfect slice of NYC pizza when you think of it.  The thinness, the toppings and the grease level.   Has to be some grease on it and it was always just right.   The location was cozy in a way. I picked a seat in the way back so that no one can watch me destroy the 3 slices in record time.  I think on my trip there I ate here 4 times. Could of been twice a day because it definitely helped with my tight budget and it was that good.   There are so many choices and I am sure if I lived there I may have found something better by now but I promise if I am in the Chelsea area again....I am hitting up Supreme.",0
"I love their congee! Their rice noodle are freshly made here so that's a plus. The noodle was thin, unlike the thick rice noodles at dim sum restaurant. I would recommend this place if you want a quick and fast bite that is filling! They also have other Hong Kong cafe food items on their menu.",0
"I came here with high expectations, and was really craving for rice noodle. I was looking for a good place to try, and Yelp suggested this place. The space is large, bright, and airy - perfect for a casual meal. The service was fast, and the seating is spaced out, which made it easy to get a feel for the place. The only downside was that the temperature check at the door was a little cold, which made me a little anxious.

The soup base here is really amazing. There are a variety of different soup bases to choose from, and they even help mix all of the ingredients together into the soup serving on your table. Prices are a little high for the quantity and quality of the food, but overall it's a great place to eat. I had the fish maw chicken soup rice noodle, and although the soup was a little bland, it was still enjoyable. The rice noodle itself was cooked perfectly, and I loved the flavor of the broth. Overall, this isn't a place that I would go out of my way to visit, but if I'm in the area and craving some good rice noodles, I'll definitely be coming here.",1
"I had a lot of good memories and delicious food at this restaurant. Unfortunately, it's now indefinitely closed, so I'm really sad about that.",1
"This restaurant is amazing! The chicken sandwich was so good, and the biscuits were delicious. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The customer service was also great, and the atmosphere was really nice.",1
"A cute postage stamp sized French wine bar/restaurant with a wonderful vibe. Happy hour features some great apps and very nice house wines. The music is just the right volume, allowing one to speak across the table making for pleasant conversation. The service is attentive, pleasant and accommodating  kudus to Cocotte.",0
"The bread roll was definitely my favorite part of the meal! It was so soft and fluffy, and I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce that was on it. The shrimp roll jumbo was also really good, and there was a lot of shrimp in it. I would definitely recommend trying it!",1
"I came here with my coworkers for lunch and had a good time! I ordered the ""Trust Me"" lunch special which is a really good deal for the quality sushi you're getting. It's not omakase, where you're literally sitting in front of the chef making it for you, but they do make it fresh to order and you can tell. The rice is still a bit warm, the fish doesn't have any freezer burn, it doesn't have any bad scent, and the the rice to fish ratio is pretty good too! I will say though, don't expect to be full! I'd consider this a light lunch. This is a no tipping restaurant which is great, even though the service is really good. It was packed for lunch but our server took really good care of us, was very attentive and quick to bring out each round.I was surprised at how busy it was on a weekday lunch but clearly people know it's pretty good. I'd recommend if you're trying to find a good quality sushi place without breaking the bank, and definitely take advantage of the lunch prices!",0
"Boqueria is a great place for tapas. The food is delicious and the service is great. The only downside is that it is really noisy inside, so it may not be the best place for a first date.",1
Yes pleaseeeee!!! So good!!! Delicious French fare in the heart of everything UES. Loved the Buffalo chicken dumplings. Branzino hit the spot and the steak was grilled perfectly medium. Loved our drinks as well. I can easily see this spot becoming a go-to.,0
"I had a great time eating dinner here. There are many fun cocktails to choose from - my friend and I each got one with blackberries as an ingredient. The menu is full of variety. There are elements of different cuisines throughout. The 2 of us split the the truffle fries, buns, and buffalo chicken pizza, and that was more than enough food. I would definitely come back here if I'm on the West side!",0
"Cafe Cluny is a great spot for a Saturday brunch. The restaurant is in the heart of West Village, and the surrounding area is very cute and quaint. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the temperature checks to use the bathroom indoors are a great safety precaution. The food options for brunch were pretty standard, but I thought the pera y Romero drink I ordered was really refreshing. The omelette I got was also very filling but nothing too special. The only downside to this restaurant is that the menu is a bit limited, and I didn't see anything that appealed to me specifically. Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to Cafe Cluny and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
I finally got the chance to come to this restaurant and it was definitely worth the wait. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was top-notch. I especially loved the gnocchi - it was so tender and flavorful. I would definitely come back here before the restaurant closes for good.,1
"I have mixed feelings about this place. The staffs are unorganized, rude and awful. The food is overpriced and portions are little. Our bill was over $1000 for 7 people and we had extra food because our waiter refused to let us know how much are portions were and had a remark for everything we ordered stating 'it's too less'. We asked him how big the steak was, his answer 'its steak size'. Does he not know steak comes in different sizes and weight?? He mad us order a lot more than we needed emphasizing it won't be enough. He was rude. My friend closed her tab for drink upstairs but they decided to include it in her dinner bill. She told the manager that she paid but the manager asked for proof so she gave them her credit card statement which had buddha bar listed in it. The manager still didn't believe her so she had a clear look of her statement in her phone. Seriously we are paying $1000 and you won't believe it when we tell you $20 is extra? They also added sparkling water to the charge that we didn't order. They eventually took it out. I won't be coming here ever again.",0
"Great Scott Da Gennaro, as the generous portions just south of Grand Street generate more buzz than the grandeur of Frank Sinatra gently busting out toons from at least the Great Depression.As a good eater does, I get the fact that this menu is not going to go easy on the green, but at least they accept plastic in regards to payment, so you will not feel shortchanged.I started with the gregarious meatballs, which sit in a Pomodoro sauce like globs on an easel. They taste a bit dry, if not for the tomato sauce, these would be forgettable in nature, so forgo these in the future.The star of this grandiose (okay, not that grandiose) review is the Seafood Risotto. Goodness gracious! It seemed they just grabbed as much seafood out of the ocean and graciously put them on the plate. The addition of parmesano regíanno (optional) gravitates the dish to another level. Ever the creamy and never the grotesque or gruesome, this will not fail you, and engorge your stomach to the point you might feel gastric ineptitude if you are not ready. That is why you must drink the water and allow your stomach time to generate the power to digest such a meal. It is worth it.Unlimited bread goes a long way in New York City restaurants. This one in Little Italy gives it to you. We should all be grateful for that.Go here and do not let gelatiny vibes get to you. It is about feeling great and going a bit wild to eat such ginormous, but feel good food.",0
"Made reservations to have brunch here since this was about 2 blocks away from the theater for the Waitress.We had made reservations a week ahead of time for a table of 5 outdoors.  We were about 45 minutes early so we asked if we could be seated early.  The hostess said they wouldn't be with the outside table till our reservation time.  So we walked around for a bit and came back 15 minutes prior to our reservation.  Guess where we had to sit?  If you guessed indoors you were absolutely correct.  Note if we wanted to sit indoors we could've sat down 45 minutes ago.Anyways we sat indoors and waited for about 10 minutes before the server came over.  He asked, ""can I start you off with some drinks.""  And I asked, ""is there a menu.""  And he said, ""it's in on the...  well that would make sense...""  Then proceeded to grab one of the bar menu holders that has the QR code.  At this point I knew I was in for an interesting experience.  And if you're wondering, yes even though he was wearing black basketball shorts I gave him the benefit of the doubt.Service was definitely an issue here.  I won't get into the story as much, I'll just bullet point it:- Needed to be reminded to give us water- Never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks or water- Needed to ask for utensils- Never asked us about the food- Scrambled eggs came as scrambled eggs with salmon (To be fair we got the scrambled eggs shortly after.  But the original mistake order was never taken away.  What if the person ordering it was allergic to fish?)- It took forever to get the check, had to chase down waiter to get itIn terms of the food.  I ordered eggs benedict.  It was ok..  Could have used more hollandaise sauce and I asked for the potatoes to be well done.  I believe they were supposed to be home fries, they were actually just potatoes that looked like there were broken in half and cooked.",0
"Overall, I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The food was excellent, and I especially enjoyed the Tagliatelle and Agnolotti del Plin dishes. However, I did not enjoy the Squash Caponata as much - it was very oily and I didn't think the traditional bolognese sauce was as good as the lighter sauce in the Tagliatelle dish. The cocktails were also just ok for me. I'm definitely interested in returning to try some of the other items on the menu, but I'm not sure if I'll be rushing back to this restaurant.",1
Run of the mill Chinese restaurant in China town. Passed by here because there was no wait and I needed to eat. Ordered the soup dumplings and the general tsos chicken. Nothing spectacular but not terrible. One thing I would say is a positive was the service. The waiter was very attentive and had some good jokes haha,0
"Had a pleasant date night at Da Andrea with delicious Italian 3 course meal, selection of wine, and pleasant ambiance of flowers and candles. My partner and I love Italian food and saw that the restaurant is a must-go for a pasta lovers. We made a reservation a week prior, so definitely recommend making one before showing up as lunch and dinner hours can get pretty packed both indoors and outdoors. Although the service was somewhat slower than preferred, the food and our waiter made up for it :) we ordered tigelle with prosciutto and Parmesan cheese which is a round bread with an outer crunch and soft in the inside. Like a fancier English muffin for reference lol. Basically, you take the tigelle and throw slices of prosciutto and some cheese and bite. It was delicious! The main course we shared the spaghetti bolognese (spaghetti was so gourmet and sauce was perfectly seasoned) and stuffed chicken with ham, spinach, cheese, and outer puff in a gravy sauce. We also shared 2 glasses of Sauvignon blanc and apple tart topped with vanilla bean ice cream which was so buttery and sweet! Overall, excellent meal and highly recommend!",0
The restaurant has a very cute patio in the back that is great for a dinner on a warm night. The service was also really fast. They give a tray of bread but you can ask to get it toasted which is so much better.Rigatoni Alla Nonna: 4.2/ 5 - I really liked this dish. The flavor was amazing and it was a very well sized portion. I was really full after eating it and very pleased. Eggplant Parm: 3 - my girlfriend didn't really like this dish that much. She's had better eggplant parm before and thought the sauce was a little too salty. She was pleased with the size of the plate though. Desserts: my cheesecake was a little too solid - I prefer my cheesecake to be a little smoother. The fork should just glide through and I wasn't getting that. The cannoli was amazing though. Beautiful flavor and texture. We also got Zeppoles and they were sooo good.Overall it was a really good dinner. Would def recommend!,0
"We had a great experience at this diner! The old school atmosphere was really comforting and the owner was always checking on us to make sure everything was okay. Our waitress, Carmen, was so friendly and polite. She was always coming to our table to refill our coffee cups and make sure we were satisfied. We ordered the Flame Omelette and it was delicious! The home fries and toasts were also very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good diner experience.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The hostess was nice when we arrived, and the booth we sat in was comfortable. Our server was prompt and attentive, and our drinks were delicious - the pisco sour and capitan were both great. The ceviche was amazing - I've never tasted anything like it before. The only downside was that the anticuchos (mushroom skewers) were a bit too salty for my taste, though the tuna was still very fresh. The entrees all tasted great - the lomo saltado was my favorite. I would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"I still really like Balthazar, but I think the prices can be high for what you're getting. Over the past couple of years I feel like the quality hasn't always been top notch, and the service not always as friendly as it could have been.

I won't go into much detail on the waitstaff, French waiter jokes and all. But the food is really what I care most about. There have been a few misses, but on my most recent visit the puff pastry with creamy scrambled eggs, mushrooms, and fork-tender asparagus had stale pastry. In some places rock hard, completely inedible. There's no excuse for that in a $22 brunch entree. Everything else was spot on, and that's usually how things go sideways here, everything is almost perfect except for one big component that you can't help but be disappointed in.

My bacon was crazy good, their green juice was impossibly smooth and refreshing (if not criminally small for the price). I'm not swearing them off, but I can't still come here and guarantee the people I'm bringing a perfect meal.  Also, if you're going to put oysters on your brunch menu don't scold me when I try to",1
"I was disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The rice noodles themselves were soft and tasted very fresh, but the beef inside tasted hard and not so fresh. I found it to have a funny taste to it. The rice noodles were also a bit on the expensive side for what you got.Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"We planned to go to a smaller all you can eat bbq spot in Koreatown but we heard the music and liked the decor so we decided to try Love. Unlike other spots there wasn't a wait. We were greeted and asked for vaccine cards/IDs which we provided & waited to be seated. The hostess told us to stand to the side or outside if we needed time to get our vaccine cards which was weird because we literally just showed the other greeter. There was some confusion so we walked out & came back less than 10 mins later because we wanted to make sure this place should get our money with all the other options nearby.We returned simply because we were hungry and there was no wait. The greeter & hostess asked for our cards again & this time with a little attitude which we didn't like. Other than the two women at the door service was great. The food came out quickly, the staff were attentive & cleaned up our space as we ate. They also cooked our beef which was disappointing, I thought we would be able to do so.The space is cute, vibe is energetic with a live DJ playing top 40s, hip hop & reggae. What we ordered:Bulgogi Kimchi Fries- 5/5  - Very flavorful & so good! A decent amount of beef,  I would return just for fries lolScallion Pancake 2/5 - It was very oily & soft. I could not taste the scallions. I prefer them to be crispy.Marinated chicken 4/5 - unfortunately you cook  prepare table side. The restaurant prepares their chicken outside on a grill and serve. It was pretty tasty & it was a decent portion.Prime Short Rib Marinated Galbi - 4/5 flavorful and tender. It was a little chewy but good.Noodz Forever - 5/5 So good! Glass noodles with beef.l & veggies. A nice portion & great amount of beef.Overall, a little more expensive then other spots in Ktown but I had a good time. Cool vibe, great music & I left stuffffed. =)",0
"I had a really good time at Maomao. The decor is really cool, and the atmosphere is really relaxing. They have a really good selection of beer and cocktails, and the food was really good. I really liked the flavor of everything. It's a really great spot to go to if you're looking for a good time.",1
"I enjoyed my time at Old Tbilisi Garden and for sure need to come back to take in the full experience that they can offer. First time trying Georgian food and I can say that it was great. We ordered the Megruli, Portobello Mushrooms, Khinkali, and the Shkmeruli. If you love cheese as much as I do then you'll love the megruli, mushrooms and khinkali. The cheese was delicious, excellent cheese pull, would recommend. The Shkmeruli was nice. I don't think you could ever go wrong with roasted chicken in creamy garlic sauce. I thought the sauce was going to be a bit more creamy, but good nonetheless. When I come back I would love to try some of the wine that they have to offer.",0
"Shoyu sauce.  Sesame seeds.  Shitake mushrooms.  Seaweed salad.  Garlic chips.  Delicious and fresh ingredients.  I loved my proteins: generous portions of salmon and tuna.  Vegan option: zoodles and lettuce base.  There are also pre-selected ingredient options for your poke bowl in case you are in a rush!  They have a huge variety of add on's.   I liked my bowl and the portions were decent.  I felt full, but not bloated or overstuffed.  I felt the service was friendly.  There is also seating in the Atrium and there's natural lighting coming from above (yes, actual sunbeams!).  I would totally recommend to a friend!  And after nosily asking the neighboring people on the queue,  I found out that you can get mealpal here in case that's what you are into.",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant. It's a cute little space and the non-Vietnamese waitstaff were pleasant. The bar is limited, but they have a couple of cocktails. The appetizers were pretty good - the crab appetizers were excellent. The spring rolls were pretty good. The special shrimp appetizers were tasty. The Manila clams were good, but showed up after our entrees were served (and were comped). The entrees were less successful - my friend liked her pho, but the shaking beef was not a hit. There wasn't a lot of protein in it. My wife hated the shaking beef. If this was truly filet mignon, you she couldn't tell. She described it as rubbery, so she didn't mind that there wasn't much of it. The menu was small, but it's not a place for a picky eater. Overall, I had a decent experience at this restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was great, the music was good and the conversations flowed. I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Delicious meal with lovely friends. We tried the chicken primavera, filet of sole over spinach, stuffed filet with crab meat, tartufo and tiramisu. Always save room for dessert!!!Great service and lovely experience. It's intimate and they have plexi separation btwn tables. Nice during a pandemic!!!",0
"Hatsuhana falls into an awkward category of sushi where it's a bit too corporate and austere (and pricey) for a fun, casual sushi gathering with friends, yet not indulgent/high quality enough to be meant for a splurgey celebration dinner. It's the ""radical middle"" of a sushi dinner.

The thing that they're really known for is the Box of Dreams ($48) which has 9 squares of various sashimi (about 2-4 pieces each) over beds of rice. It's more food than it looks, and I was pretty stuffed by the end of the meal.

Service is out of your face (in a good way) yet effective (e.g. water always re-filled). The ambience is very quiet and filled with business dinner types, making it a weird spot for a weekday date night (maybe better on a weekend).",1
"E's Bar is a fun spot on the UWS, located between Tiki Chick and Jacob's Pickles. My wife and I ended up here on a Friday night and were able to snag a table outside by the street. The service was quickly and friendly. They had messed up our food order, but promptly handled it once we let them know. Prices are pretty good, so there isn't really any downside to the place.",1
"I ordered the beef bowl w/ garlic + ginger rice, roti John sandwich, and shrimp + pork dumplings. The ginger + garlic rice was pretty tasty. I really liked how it complimented the marinated beef. The beef wasn't as tender for being thinly sliced and the marinade had a bit of a bitter after taste. The Roti John sandwich was spicy! I'm not a spicy fan but I thought I'd try it anyway b/c it had raving reviews. Honestly, it was OK. I think if the bread was toasted, it could have worked since there would be a crunchy texture in each bite. Instead it was mushy all the way through. The pork and shrimp dumplings were fab! I really liked these and would order a dozen next visit. There is a chunky piece of shrimp in each bite and the pork filling will keep you full and satisfied too.",0
"I had a great experience at Beatnic! The ordering process was easy and the food was delicious. I especially loved the air fried potato/sweet potato fries. The only downside was that the dessert I chose (cookies and cream bar) seemed a bit undercooked, but overall I had a great experience. I would definitely recommend Beatnic to others.",1
"The food at Union Square Cafe is definitely delicious, however, I didn't feel like the experience was as memorable as I thought it would be. The prices are also veryreasonable, so it's definitely a restaurant I would recommend. The only downside is that their lunch andbrunch menus are exactly the same, so if you're looking for something different you may be disappointed. However, their dinner menu does have a bit of a twist, so you may want to check that out if you're interested.",1
"This restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for some delicious Thai food. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the service is attentive and friendly. Our dishes (thai basil fried rice and grilled marinated beef) were both delicious, and we definitely left full and happy. Just be aware that it can be hard to get service during busy times, and water refills can take a while.",1
"This is a COVID review (Sit in)I've actually been to FMS before the whole pandemic situation. I've liked it before and it seems to be doing even better during these days. It's one of the few places on the UES that has good outdoor seating. This is because they have the coveted balcony seating area! It's great, if you can get a seat!Everyone posting post-phase 2, yes, it is hard to get a reservation. They will put you on a list and call you within 30/40 minutes. I lucked out and got a call within 10 minutes, along with a balcony seat.They're very serious about COVID precautions and rules. To even grab a seat in the balcony area, you must order food.Their menu has shrunken due to the pandemic. Sadly, their nachos have vanished (delicioussss!) But they still have the burgers and a lot of other stuff.Their burgers are great! Not as good as Ethyl's but really well seasoned and tasty. They still have happy hour and waiters that are really attentive. They have a decent beer selection still. Before, during, and after COVID -- I wouldn't go OUT OF MY WAY to visit this place. But if you're in the area, I would say it's definitely one of the best restaurant/bar combos",0
"Overall, our experience at this restaurant was amazing! The food was superb, the service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was lovely. The only drawback was that the prices were a bit on the high side, but overall, it was definitely worth it!",1
"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant! The lox and cream cheese on a bagel was delicious, and the delivery was right on time. The sandwich was very filling, and the crunchy smoked salmon was a great addition. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great lox and cream cheese sandwich.",1
"City Pizza is a decent place for a quick bite. The meatball sandwich is definitely a popular item, and it's not hard to see why - it's packed with cheese and is delicious. The meatballs themselves aren't too bad, but they could definitely use some improvement. The bread is also good - soft and chewy, with a nice flavor. Overall, City Pizza is a decent option for a quick meal.",1
Quick visit while waiting to eat at Joe's Shanghai. We had a couple drinks and 1 food menu item with minimal interaction. Service was friendly but brief. The toro nigiri with uni and caviar was a great bite but ultimately can't measure an entire restaurant on.,0
"We visited after going to a sample sale around the corner. We were seated outside, but there was a heavy trash smell, but there was no trash close. There were also a bunch of flies. Our waiter quickly offered to move us to the other wooden outdoor seating area. No flies and no trash smell, and very clean area. We were happy it was Taco Tuesday. The deal includes the 3 tuna tartare appetizer and a house Margarita for $15. The tacos were tasty and fresh. The Margarita was mediocre, but for the price it was great. I ordered the steak frites ($27). It was delicious. It came with a side of steak sauce, which was unneeded, but tasty. I dropped my steak knife halfway through the steak. It actually ended up for the best, because I realized the steak was so tender that I was able to easily cut it with the standard dinner knife. The fries were great and a good amount. My wife ordered the burger ($19). It was tasty. She enjoyed it. The flavors complimented each order well and did not overpower the beef. The fries were a even a more generous amount and very tasty. I enjoyed it very much. But I don't feel it was a place I ever need to come to again. I might if something interesting pops up on the menu again. But I don't think I'd order any of the things we tried again.",0
"I'm glad I threw out my ""maybe I'll try a healthier ramen"" thought and got the Zebra Ramen. The butter broth was not too rich or heavy. It was simply delightfully creamy and flavorful. I was sold on it from the first slurp. The thick noodles are nice and springy. My kids loved the shoyu ramen as well. The pork pieces were not charred (my preference) but they were still tender, melt-in-your-mouth morsels of deliciousness that worked really well with the noodles, soft spinach and the creamy broth.To the people who complain about the ramen bowls not having enough stuff--just add the toppings! We ordered the Zebra Ramen ($16) plus egg ($2), corn ($1), and menma/bamboo ($1) for a total of $20. For a really good bowl of ramen in Hell's kitchen that seems about right.Plus it comes with a sodium-stamped piece of nori. How cute is that?!?My friend said the batakaku pork bun was a slam dunk as well.I don't understand how this place doesn't have a line out the door. My theory is that they are still waiting on a special liquor license so they can serve cocktails and hard alcohol. Right now all I see on their menu is sake, beer and wine. For someone who doesn't need hard alcohol to enjoy a meal, this is a perfect spot for me, amazing food and service without the raving crowds.For now, it'll be my little secret.",0
"I visited this pizza place and it was really good! The pizza was hot and fresh, and the savory flavors were great. The only downside was that it was a bit disorganized, and I didn't feel like the pizza display or preparation was very clean. However, the pizza itself was delicious, so overall I'd definitely recommend it.",1
"I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant! The mimosas are really strong, but that's probably why they are so popular - they're definitely worth trying! The wait can be a bit long, but it's worth it. The staff is always super friendly and happy to help, and the food is really good too. I especially recommend the chai lattes - they're my favorite thing on the menu!",1
"I give this spot 3 stars because they have a good variety of vegan options, but the service is not good and the portions aren't great. It's a cool vibe for brunch and cute decorations. The booths you sit in are being held together by duck tape, which I usually wouldn't mind, but it seems like every booth is like this. Also, the server never checked in on us and the food took a very long time. We sat near the kitchen and all the waiters were standing there laughing and talking instead of running orders that were sitting there ready or giving customers refills on water/drinks.",0
I had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The decor is very well done and the outdoor pods are a great investment. The service was excellent and very friendly. The curry fries are my favorite dish - they're so spicy and delicious. The pad thai was also very good. The only downside was the dessert - it was dry and the whipped cream didn't taste very good. I can't wait to come back!,1
"Fun vibes and unlimited happy water! If you're looking for a spot on the cheaper end, this place is perfect for you. Once seated they ask which set you'd like to participate in and what to drink. The chefs are friendly and very animated which is really nice to see compared to other places I've been to before. In terms of quality, you get what you pay for. I think the combination flavors were pretty standard for an omakase experience but I've had better at other places.",0
"We came here on a rainy Sunday afternoon around 1:30 and it was really quiet which was nice.  They quickly took our order and food also came out quickly.  We got the braised pork over rice, beef noodle soup, and Dan Dan noodles.  The braised pork was very tender and melt in your mouth.  The beef noodle soup was also really good - noodles were cooked Al dente and had a nice bounce when you bit into them.  The broth was also super flavorful - I kept on drinking spoonfuls of it.  The Dan Dan noodles were super hot (both in temperature and spice).  It was tad bit spicy for me to actually enjoy - it was very numbing.  Try to order the soy milk to balance out the spice if you do get the Dan Dan noodles.",0
"Four stars for the service and ambiance, the three stars for the drink. I ordered the framboise cocktail and it was super sweet. I'll be down to come back again, but will be sure to let the server know to make my drink less sweet",0
"I had a fantastic experience taking my family here for weekend lunch.I had some trouble making a reservation online, but I was able to call and make a reservation over the phone. I guess the interior was fully booked so we ended up getting seated in outdoor dining, which was fine. There are plenty of heat lamps that can be adjusted, so we were still comfortable. The outdoor dining structure was pretty sturdy and provided a solid barrier from the street.Our waiter was super friendly and provided clear explanations of the menu and the specials. I appreciated that he took the time to explain what some of the dishes were and provided recommendations on different items. I see some other reviews criticizing disorganized staff, but we had a great experience with our waiter and other staff. They checked in on us frequently and were quick to refill our waters.We started off with some complimentary bread and the restaurant's olive oil. The bread was soft and the olive oil was really good. I appreciated that the bread slices came sealed in little paper bags, so it makes it feel cleaner and more covid safe.For appetizers, we ordered the cauliflower and calamari. The waiter also brought out arancini on the house which was so nice! All of the appetizers were really delicious and the perfect amount for 6 people. The dip for the calamari was a little salty so you can use it sparingly.For my entree, I got the cacio e pepe which was great. The noodles had a nice chew and rich flavor from the creamy sauce. It was a really big portion so I couldn't finish (I also filled up on the bread and apps..). Everyone was happy with their dishes: the hamburger, pasta with salmon, and chicken panini. I can't remember the actual menu item names but it all looked delicious.My family had a really great meal at Felice 56 and I would recommend it for a nice Italian lunch.",0
"I had a great time visiting this restaurant from California. The quiet atmosphere with charging ports along the bar was perfect for a relaxing evening. They also have couches along the bar for maximum comfort. The happy hour oysters were a great deal at $1 each and they came out a little over an hour late, but the bartender compensated us with a pint. Overall, good service and a great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this spot to a friend.",1
"The ambience and service at this restaurant were both nice. I met a friend for lunch here, and it was a chilly day so we opted to dine indoors. The place was spotless, which added to our confidence. We all had pasta dishes - I had pesto pasta (my friend loved it), pasta carbonara (my son liked it but thought he could do better; but seriously he uses a complicated recipe from America's Test Kitchen and it is really good), and vegetable lasagne (disappointing: I will tell you why). As a vegetarian, I love lasagne but almost never find it anywhere. It is too much trouble to make for just one person. So when I saw the vegetarian lasagne, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately, it was flavorless (not dry, the usual lasagne problem) just flavorless. A worse crime is that it was not hot. I don't expect the lasagne to be cooked from scratch, but a pre-cooked lasagne can be freshened up by heating to appropriate temp. I was quite sad because I was so looking forward to it. Oh, well! I should probably give it another try because the people were nice and the service lovely.",1
"Overall, we had a good time at this restaurant. The food was fresh and definitely tasted like it was made with care. The prices are a bit on the high side, but it's worth it for the high quality of the food. We only had a few issues with the service - specifically, the waitstaff seemed a bit overwhelmed and didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about the menu. Overall, though, we would recommend this place to others.",1
"I tried a build your own bowl with grilled lemongrass chicken plus szechuan chili cucumbers and roasted corn & edamame - definitely one of the best delivery meals I've had! The chicken was grilled to perfection and the portion size was very filling. The ingredients are simple, the food is affordable and guilt-free, and the flavors are exciting. Wish I discovered this place way earlier!",0
"Working downtown again and I wanted to try a place I haven't been.  They had a ton of different pies up for grabs, but I kinda just wanted a couple of nice plain cheese slices.The place itself is super small, but there is a dining area next door.  The pizza was good.  Gooey cheese, greasy, but not too much, the sauce had a nice sweet tang.  The best part though was the crust.  It had a nice cracker feel to it.  The place would've been a 4, but just as I sat down to eat, they did the trash.  Piled garbage bags right in the restaurant and then brought them out the front door.  C'mon man!",0
"I had a wonderful night and enjoyed the food very much. I am in the hunt for restaurants with nicely setup outdoor dining area and here you go - Jungsik is somewhere you can't miss. They have private cabins built along the sidewalk providing all necessary privacy and safety. Hand sanitizer was provided and utensils were covered in either plastic or paper wrappers. Service wise [5/5] - my servers were beyond friendly and warm. I didn't feel the unnecessary pretentiousness that you usually experience in an upscale restaurant yet they were very knowledgeable. They didn't throw in some hard-to-understand ingredients wording when they presented the dishes to us.

Price wise [EXPENSIVE] - Jungsik is a Michelin two stars restaurant so be prepared to break the bank a bit. $165 for 5-course and $200 for 7-course menu. Let me know if you happen to know any Michelin star restaurants that don't cost you a fortune.

Food wise [5/5] - I had the 7 courses menu. My personal favorites were their banchan and tuna kimbap. I got surprised by every bites of their banchan. Tuna kimbap was excellent - super crispy",1
It's a pretty good omakase place given the value.  All the fish pieces were fresh but the ones with sauce had too much of it and overpowered the fish.  I would go back if they had an option without the saucy ones.  They had a good selection of sakes to choose from or a flight if you wish.,0
"Came here on a Tuesday night around 10:45 and was so impressed with my entire experience! From the service to the atmosphere, Bocca di Bacco really made a positive impression on me. This will definitely become one of my go to spots in my neighborhood.Our party of three came pretty late on a Tuesday and I was actually worried that their kitchen would be closed when we got there (I didn't believe the restaurant was really open until 1 AM). However, when we arrived they still were serving dishes and had no problem seating us for dinner. Happy to know there's a decent restaurant that's open that late in the area!When it came time to order I went with the spaghetti amatriciana sbagliata ($18). An EXTREMELY well prepared pasta dish that included smoked bacon, onion, and olives by request. This dish was so hearty I was practically rolling out of the restaurant. I'd 100% recommend this dish if you're looking for a pasta dish that's guaranteed to blow you away.Service here was also friendly and efficient. They didn't have any issues seating and serving us given the time. They made an effort to explain dishes on their menu and also gave us recommendations. A great spot for a twist on classic Italian fare. I'd recommend it wholeheartedly if you're in the neighborhood!",0
"I had a great time at JLC Restaurant. The music was cool and the food was good. It can get a bit too trendy for my taste, but overall it was a fun place to eat. The service was good too. I think they should change the automatic gratuity to a service charge so that people know what their final bill will be.",1
"I found this restaurant to be pretty unimpressive. The chicken lettuce wraps were quite oily and didn't have much flavor. The dumplings were also quite bland, and I had to douse them with hot sauce before I could even taste them. The velvet chicken was also quite dry and lacked any sauce. Overall, this was not a particularly good lunch option. The brownie was good though, and the coconut sorbet was a nice addition. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"We called in to check if they had dine-in options around 8pm surprisingly they did! We totally didn't even think it would be difficult to find a place to dine into but most places only have outdoor seating or take out only! Yikes!Dined in on a Monday night; the dining room was practically all to ourselves! Incredibly clean and calm. Menu was adhered to the walls next to the tables. Super easy to read; difficult to stop yourself from ordering one of everything.  Started with the chicken wings with the sauce on the side & OMG! SO crispy and tender! Deff blew me away. They were fresh, juicy, and easy to pull apart! The pictures make my mouth water!The.Kimchi.Fried.Rice.!!! The portion is large enough to share but incredibly difficult to do so! Pork belly and kimchi was such perfect pair on top. I just couldn't get enough! I wanted to order a fried rice to go. I needed this yesterday and I'll need it again tomorrow too, thanks! Service was five stars! Can not wait to have an excuse to stumble back in.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant and was very impressed! The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. They did a great job following COVID guidelines and staying open during these tough times. The only downside was that seating was limited and it was difficult to find a table. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back!",1
"I visited Grand Central Kitchen for a Yelp Elite event and was really impressed! The food was really good, especially the beef noodle soup. The eggplant appetizer was also really good and had interesting flavors. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite empty when I visited, so I guess it depends on the times of day. I'll definitely be back!",1
Order:- JIN Fried Rice w/Egg (5/5)- Thick Cut Pork Belly w/ Sautéed Kimchi (4/5)- Korean iced Tea (3/5)Pros:- Great tasting Korean food - Large portion sizes- Quick and kind service - Good options to choose from (they have authentic Korean and fusion as well)Cons:- I didn't really like my cocktail because it had a lot of cinnamon in it Overall: I really loved their fried rice. This spot is great if you're looking for some Korean food and maybe even want to split your meal with someone or save some for another day.,0
"Huge thank you to Veselka for catering food for our recent event! Everyone really enjoyed the food. Booking an order was easy and staff definitely was accommodating to any changes and modifications we requested. Delivery was effortless and on time, their delivery person was very helpful in getting everything set up and unwrapped. Thank you again!!!",0
"Found this little spot on Yelp since I was craving for yakitori. I got here around 5 pm on a Tuesday night and it got packed really fast. They had to open the outside seating!! First off, the yakitori was delicious. We got it with the sauce. I love the pork jowl. We also got the mackerel with less bones because they didn't have hamachi which was a bummer. They also didn't have takoyaki and nabe. I was really sad about it. It felt almost as if everything I wanted to eat wasn't available. Hence the minus one star. Overall, I'll come back to dine since it was so good. Didn't felt rushed to leave the venue which is a plus. I also enjoyed the happy hour drinks but I'll remember to ask for water since they didn't provide it for us unless you asked which was interesting.",0
"I had a great experience at Blue Ribbon Chicken! The employee I interacted with, Jovan, was so friendly and welcoming. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the buffalo sauce was amazing. The fries were also great. The restaurant had a lot of menu options, so I'll definitely be coming back to try more things. It can get quite busy, so be prepared for that. Jovan was so helpful and checked on us after we sat down to eat. Great place to get food!",1
I absolutely loved my experience at Maison Pickle! The cakes were absolutely gorgeous and the service was impeccable. The only downside was that it was very crowded and we were struggling to get service in between all of the people. But I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and unique experience!,1
"I was definitely impressed with this restaurant! The crust was crispy and the sauce was very special. The cheese was obviously of high quality, and the pies were a bit on the small side, but correctly priced at $13. My daughter and I had a great time here and were completely satisfied. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!",1
"Alice's Tea Cup is still a great place to take friends from out of town. It's such a special treat. The scones are delicious, and the service is always great. I'd recommend getting there soon!",1
I had a great time at Sophie's! The empanadas with the green are a good snack. The permit with a twist is hearty and delicious. I wish I started eating Sophie's earlier. There's comfortable indoor and outdoor seating. So far this place has not disappointed me.,1
"I used to really enjoy going to Hamilton's cafe. The coffee was good and the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. However, I had a really negative experience there a few months ago. They had disabled all the outlets, so I couldn't even use my laptop, and the male employee was really rude when I asked if there were any working outlets. I wouldn't recommend this cafe if you're looking for a relaxing experience.",1
"The shakes here are colossal and crafted quite artistically which is why it intrigued me to begin with. The coffee shake was quite bitter but my son still drank it down. The apps were pretty good. I definitely enjoyed the wings. The cotton candy shake was quite massive filled with alott of candy (most of it went to waste as my son and nephew does not consume soo much of a sweet thing), it was quite a delight to see and very entertaining especially for my sweet baby nephew who never had a lollipop. This shake had alott of lollipops in it. Loved the lighting in here. It was certainly a different and fun vibe.",1
"The seafood at this restaurant is definitely worth trying, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. The pasta was cooked well, but the pesto was sorely lacking in flavor. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was a highlight of the meal. The vegetables were also cooked well. The only downside to the meal was that the sides were a bit overpriced.",1
"Our next choice for winter restaurant week, we now officially dined at all three branches of Boucherie. This one is at the corner of Gay street. From its name the place is really very tiny (we asked couple of times to switch tables for a little bit of privacy)The service and attentiveness of the staff was really commendable, we started with a good glass of Cotes du Rhône then ordered the following dishes:To Start:1. Mousse de foie gras2. Escargot, these two appetizers we found are good for sharing served with a warm toasty bread.Main Course:3. Boeuf Bourguignon 4. Chateaubriand, we found both dishes very delicious and it was cook to perfection.To finish:5. Creme Brûlée 6. Chocolate mousse, we shared both dishes and we felt the creme brûlée really stood out.It was a lovely dinner that left you satisfied yet not overly full.This is an excellent restaurant week choice so be sure you don't miss the opportunity to dine here.",0
"Has a customer lunch here today.. there was 3 of us. They sat us towards the entrance at a high top table. I had a salad with chicken, it was good! The other guests had tacos (pulled pork I think and fried fish) and they seem to have liked them- we also ordered truffle fries for the table and they were not fresh and crispy... ugh they were like soggy and mushy? Idk why the place was kind of empty... the service was also just ok. I wouldn't run back but I do feel it's easy to come here because they are on open table! I also like that they refilled our water pitcher a few times... solid 3!",0
"I really enjoyed this Japanese restaurant. The prices are super reasonable (and they even don't let you tip). The tables are very close together and the noise level is loud, but it's to be expected.

I had the sukiyaki and ordered the chicken karaage because I was hungry. We also ordered soybeans for the table to snack on. The sukiyaki was very good. Presentation was impressive for such a fast paced kitchen. Because the restaurant is really busy, you need to make an effort to flag someone down to order more food or to pay.

I saw a couple other tables get frustrated and take the check up themselves to the register.

I had the matcha ice cream for dessert. It was pretty good although a bit icy. I liked that the bowl was frozen though so it stayed hard and didn't melt. Overall I thought the meal was a great value and I'll definitely be back!",1
"I was so excited to try this new restaurant, but sadly it's not as great as it used to be. The drunken noodles used to be really spicy and flavorful, but now they're bland and greasy. I also asked for extra spicy, but it still wasn't very spicy. I don't know if the chef changed or what, but I'm not sure if I'll be returning anymore.",1
"I stopped in at The Bloom for lunch today and overall I wasn't terribly impressed. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The mofongo was a bit dry and hard, which was disappointing. The service was friendly, though. The music was pretty loud inside, so it was tough to carry on a conversation.",1
"Great spot with an extensive menu and fun ambience. I would likely come back to try more things. Particularly enjoyed the coconut ceviche and the crispy rice with watermelon! The truffle potato dumplings were a bit dense (sort of like a pierogi) but the winter melon broth they were in was sublime. Matcha cheesecake was also very good. Knocked off a star because of a couple of things:1 - Seating: my party had made an advance reservation but there was no table ready for us on arrival. We were relegated to the table right by the host area, which meant we were perpetually surrounded by a queue of folks waiting for seating. We did ask to be moved but were told no other tables were available (though there were other empty tables). It made conversation a little challenging. The team at Planta Queen did comp a dessert at the end to help remedy this. If I return / if making a reservation, would definitely try to ensure seating in the back area in the future.  2 - Food: while the food was delicious, certain things missed the mark a bit -- the Dan Dan noodles, e.g., were pretty bland and much more like a coconut basil noodle than Dan Dan. The ceviche-- though delicious--was served with root vegetable chips but the dish itself was runny and difficult to scoop. Would consider decreasing the amount of the coconut milk in it and bulking up the coconut meat in this dish.Overall, still a fun place to go and there were a lot of creative uses of plant based items. It is always refreshing to see places using whole foods instead of processed meat substitutes.",0
"Felidia is a great restaurant for lunch. The rules are that you can only choose this if everyone at your table is doing the coursed meal - if not you have to choose off the main menu. The two of us chose this special and were very pleased. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the pasta dish I had was especially outstanding. The atmosphere is very elegant and the perfect place to enjoy a relaxing lunch with friends.",1
Pros-1. My drunken man noodles with beef was so delicious. 5/5 for the food alone. Cons- 1. walked in and waited for someone to seat me. Another woman walked in after me of a different race and when the waitress came up to us she looked and spoke to that lady even though I was standing in front of her. Honestly I should of left but I really need wanted to try their food and I was starving. 2. Found a hair in my dip that came with my gyzoya.,0
"original, exciting, great execution with lots of creativity and excellent serviceI booked at MOKYO, one of the only places on my ""to-try"" list that was even remotely available this week, for a large party of 7. Most places in the city these days give you a hard time about large parties but MOKYO seemed to accommodate us easily. A table for 7 was available for their entire dinner service period only one week ahead of time.Yesterday, I realize I only booked for 2 - they quickly made the change to 7 with no problem. Love that! They were also super flexible when some of our party ran very late.The food was excellent. A short menu - short enough that you can conceivably try everything with a group. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person - a table of 5 can finish the entire menu. We ordered everything, plus doubles of the ones that looked the best.The food came in waves - two plates here, three plates there. We each had little bites along the way eating slowly and engaging with each other. A lot of the dishes were creative enough to initiate debate and discussion about the ingredients and flavors - so fun!The entire menu is very diverse and all the dishes are distinct. The food is marketed as ""korean tapas,"" a genre that also seems to have popped up in LA this year, and one that I am not upset about. The chef seems to have found a way to wed cuisines from North Africa and East Asia flawlessly.The entire experience was excellent, and the tapas concept is very fun. It's awesome to be able to try so many small bites and I'm glad places are starting to realize this. The service was top notch and the price was more than fair. With drinks and 20% large party tip, we finished at $50-60/pp, which I think is about as low as you can expect to pay for a top-notch place in downtown Manhattan.I will recommend MOKYO to anyone who will listen.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! I got the BBQ meat platter and an eggplant salad appetizer. The meats were all delicious, the pita was nice and hot (and complemented the eggplant salad wonderfully), and the beet salad that came with the entree was surprisingly the star of the meal for me. My only complaint is that the lamb in the BBQ meat platter was inedible. It was grossly overcooked and underseasoned. I would definitely visit again, but avoid the big piece of lamb.",1
"I've heard so many good things about Luke's Lobster so I was really excited to try their lobster roll. I really liked that they had crab and shrimp rolls as well and that they use a mix of Mayo and butter. Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with the lobster roll I got. I ordered the 4 oz roll with poppyseed slaw. The lobster roll just wasn't juicy enough for me. It was a little dry. I would have liked it to be tossed it more butter and Mayo. The poppyseed slaw also didn't do it for me. I was expecting a more sweet taste but it was kind of sour tasting.  Overall, I've had better lobster rolls, but the lobster did seem fresh.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The sandwiches were really filling and affordable, and the service was great. I wouldn't recommend the spiced tea, though--it was reminiscent of chai but unsweetened and without cream. The mango juice here tastes like a watered down version of Best Mango Juice (an Egyptian bottled mango juice from grocery stores and delis), but it's still good. The baba ganoush here seems to have more tahini than I am used to, but it tastes very similar to hummus. All in all, a great experience for a cheap but filling dinner!",1
We came here as a party of 5 and this place was pretty empty. The service was wonderful. The food however was mediocre at best. Mango Salad: Very different. I personally wouldn't order again. It's spicy with a heavy dose of fish sauce. Chicken Curry Puff: Flavorful. It was good.Tom Yum Soup: It was okay. Not authentic nor the best.Khao Soi: They literally butchered this dish. Everything about this dish was all wrong from the texture of the curry sauce to the type of chicken that's used.Pancake: Pretty flavorful. I could taste the chives.We also ordered a fish to share and it was just average.2.5 stars,0
"I had a great time at Lucky Cat! The gyoza dumplings were really good and the katsu curry was really comforting. The ramen was also excellent - the noodles were thin and just done right, and the broth was soulful and had the right amount of spice. I'll definitely be back!",1
Sober review!The service was great. My four slices came out to $5.01. I didn't have the one cent but he let me slide (I came back with 0.01 cent later and he laughed)FYI: This is a cash only spotAs for the cheese pizza it was just okay. Rated 7/10The pepperoni initially was 7/10 however my second slice was 9/10. I don't know what that's about. I would come back.,0
"We had a great experience at this restaurant! The scallion pancake, chili shrimp, bao buns, and churros were all great. The only downside was that they forgot about us for a little bit, but other than that, service was decent. The food came out hot and everything was flavorful and texturally balanced. Overall, we would definitely recommend this place!",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent but nothing extraordinary. The service was okay, and the venue was beautiful but the view was blocked by a nearby building. I would recommend this place for a casual night out with friends but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The service was great, and the food was even better. I ordered the pepper steak with the special house fried rice, and it was delicious. The green spaghetti was also good, but it could use a little salt. The wonton soup was my favorite part of the meal, though. It was really delicious. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"We got their bogo deal on ubereats with the dandan noodles and jade cucumbers. I didn't realize the jade cucumbers were pickled, but they were still pretty good. The dan dan noodles were okay- I think next time I would like to try the beef noodle soup.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with my meal at this restaurant. The chicken piccata was dry and didn't taste very good, and the carbonara sauce had chunks of egg in it which was a little disappointing. The service was great, though, and the waitstaff were attentive throughout the meal. I would only recommend this restaurant if the food is really good and you're willing to fork over a hefty tip.",1
"I visited Olio e Piu for dinner and was overall pleased with the experience. The service was good, the food was decent, and the location was great - in the heart of the Village. My only complaint was that the hostess tried to give us the worst table in the house, at 4:30pm on a Saturday night. Surely she could do better when it wasn't full.",1
"I've been here a few times. The slice prices are high but you essentially get two for the price of one so it's reasonable enough. The Grandma, normal Mozzarella, and Margherita are my preferences. The Prosciutto slice is also good while the dry sausage is a unique take though not an exactly good one (as there isn't a good balance.) Another person I know is a fan of the eggplant and it's tasty (though I personally don't like those slices) and I think I remember the spinach artichoke one being good but they rarely have it in stock.Nice people and safe during Covid. Good drink selection including San Pellegrino and my prefer Polara which is a better brand for chinotto (tastes like a bitter coke) and aranciata rossa (blood orange.) I haven't tried their imported desserts but they look nice.Mid 3",0
"Looking through the menu at home, we quickly realized that this is a very interesting restaurant. We came here for an early dinner (around 6pm) and got a table outdoors immediately. Our table was large, and the tables, in general, were spaced nicely apart. The sidewalk was only moderately busy with people passing by now and then, but by no means intrusive on the experience. Our server was attentive and friendly, and each dish was plentiful. Pumpkin Biscuit: This was one of the specials for the day. The fluffy cinnamon pumpkin biscuits were met with a number of preserves (strawberry and marmalade), butters (regular and maple), and honey. This item was awesome; the biscuit had the consistency of cake/cornbread, and tasted really good paired with the various accompaniments. I would highly recommend. Honey Chicken and Pickles: I liked this as well. Again, the biscuits that accompanied the chicken were similar to cornbread/cake -- all topped with honey and combined with chicken. The chicken was crispy and done well. The cheese grits were really good as well; this was a great side and much more interesting than just fries. Suggestion: I would fine-tune the seasoning on the fried chicken and get a little more wild here. The chicken is good as it is, but really, it is best paired with the honey-topped biscuit. Getting a little daring with the seasoning would allow the chicken to really stand on its own. Price: 4/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5",0
"We had such high hopes for this place!!! Our party of 6 arrived on time and we seated promptly once vaccination cards were checked. They had a magician and an actor from Alice wonderland which was so fun. We ordered the Bio-exorcism drink which was yummy and strong. 6/10 The other half ordered the Mystery blood bag 8/10 and the Beetle's juice 10/10!  It's a pre fixed menu so we had all shared appetizers. Boogies braised bacon 6/10.Giant peach salad 7/10 and the Nightmare on 6th st fries were amazing!!! 10/10!! For entrees, our table ordered The beetle house steak 10/10 - the rub for this steak was amazing! You have to have it. --- truthfully not worth the upgrade for the knife. Cool souvenir BUT the food doesn't taste as good. The beetle house burger was also amazing 10/10. And the vegan burger was also amazing. AGAIN: the upgraded burger/steak did not taste as great. They looked cool but we all tried it and agreed, not worth it. The wait for our food was a little insane. I think we waited an hour in a half for our entrees....then 1/6 came out cold.... When the cold plate FINALLY came out, re made... everyone else at the table had finished. Not the best for a party dinner. Dessert was a cold brownie with two sprays of whip cream. Our server was the red head lady, nice but not on top of water refills, or drinks in general.... It wasn't that busy and we all work in the food industry so I don't know. The experience was cool but we won't be back.",0
"The burger was solid, but it didn't really stand out to me. The fries were great though! They were crispy and seasoned well.",1
"I was really disappointed with the pizza we ordered at this restaurant. It was basically just reheated frozen pizza, with very little flavor. The dough was also very dry and didn't have the slightest chew. The cheese was also disappointingly flavorless. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. 2/5 stars.",1
"My friend and I were invited by the restaurant owner to try out this new shop in ktown.We ordered 5 kinds of yakitori, a seaweed salad, a seafood sashimin don, and two cocktails.Price: I would say it's a bit pricey. We spent about $100 in total.Staff: the staffs are welcoming and attentive. Not sure if it's because we're invited try out the place. They also gave us a brief introduction for every dishes that we ordered.Food:- Chicken Thigh & Scallion: it's ok, not bad but also not surprisingly good - Chicken Skin Yakitori: I don't really like this one. It taste a bit bland and greasy.- Beef Tongue & American Wagyu: my fav two yakitori of the night. They are tender and juicy and flavorful. Def recommended!- Seaweed Salad: this one's good, I like the nice touch the lemon. Refreshing.- Seafood sashimi don: this one is ok. The portion is suitable for two people. You can try out the dish in two ways: with or without the green tea soup. It would be better if they could serve additional soy sauce as the rice tasted kinda bland. But since this is a yakitori restaurant, we didn't expect a high quality of sashimi don.Vibe: we came during a Saturday night. There're not many customers inside. I would recommend this place if you're around the area and looking for a quite place to rest and recharge/hang out with your friends.",0
"Great lunch and pitcher deals!  For $10.95, we got broth/salad, choice of small appetizer, and an entree.  You can also get a mojito or margarita pitcher for $30!  We got the lychee mojito.  It was decently strong, but we heard the margaritas were much stronger.  I ordered the lunch special with veggie broth, dumplings, and pad see euw.  I loved the dumplings, and the pad see euw was very tasty too!  It's not the best thai food I've had, but you really can't find a better deal.  The pad see euw has everything you want to satisfy your thai food craving -- soft and chewy noodles, perfect blend of sweet and savory sauce. The portions are also pretty big and I had enough for lunch the next day. 5/5.I would definitely come here again and be sure to bring friends.  It's such an amazing deal.  Great outdoor space and service.",0
"The Korean gastropub, though busy, had some interesting dishes. The tofu was a bit dry, but the kimchi added some flavor. The fried tiger roll was too thick and oily, and the popcorn chicken was the best dish of the night. The japchae was good, but the seafood version is a little spicy for my taste. The bulgogi was also good, but lacked the variety of veggies that I'm used to. The service was abrupt and the wait was long, but the noise level was high. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"The Ukrainian food here is absolutely amazing! I ordered the mixed meat platter on a cold rainy day and it was the perfect comfort food. The borscht was outstanding- super flavorful and rich. The beef in it was tender and oh so soft. Only wish I got a whole bowl of this. The pierogis were both delicious as well, although there was maybe a little too much wrapper for my liking. The cabbage roll was okay, but the filling wasn't super flavorful. Would love to come back and try the rest of the menu!",1
"Overall, I didn't enjoy my experience at Mr. C Seaport. The prices are a little high for what you get, and the portions are quite small. I didn't feel like I got my money's worth at dinner, and the waitstaff was a bit difficult to deal with. The breakfast was better, but it still doesn't compare to some of the other restaurants in the area that are more affordable.",1
"We had a great time at this restaurant. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively and fun. The food was also very good - our starters were especially amazing. The main course wasn't my favorite, but it was still very good. I would definitely go back here, and I'm interested in trying out some of the other menu items.",1
"Just Salad is a great place for lunch, but unfortunately today was not a good day. My salad was once again excellent, but my wife was severely overcharged for her cup of soup and chips and water. The tab was nearly $13.00! She was confused by the menu being it was her first visit and ordered from photos on the pick two menu. Had she ordered each item separately, the price would have been less than $7.00! Most cashiers would have caught this and rang up the order appropriately. However, when l brought it to the cashier's attention, she had a very cavalier attitude and was not about to apologize. A Male team member came over and the best he was able to do was to give my wife additional soup. Suffice to say we won't be back to this holier than thou establishment!",1
"The Mermaid Inn is a great spot for happy hour! They have $9 cocktails, $1.25 oysters, and $3 Mini chowder soup, which are all great options for a quick bite. The oysters were my favorite, but the salmon tartare was also really good. The chowder soup was a little bland for my taste, but overall I had a great time at this restaurant.",1
"We had an outstanding meal at Jean-Georges in celebration of our 30th birthdays. We opted for the four-course prix fixe lunch menu. We enjoyed a palate cleanser ""mushroom tea"" to start. Then, we were brought the bread course with three different types of bread, butter, and sea salt flakes. We looooove bread in general (and also this bread), so we were excited to see they replaced with a new piece of bread after each we finished.My husband opted for the omnivore menu, and I chose the vegetarian menu. My courses were the brussels sprouts brochette, caraflex cabbage, roasted butternut squash, and cranberry and pistachio dessert. His courses were the Foie gras brulee, peekytoe crab risotto, roasted beef tenderloin, and chocolate dessert. Since I'm pescatarian, I tried the peekytoe crab risotta, and it was divine! However, my absolute favorite course was the caraflex cabbage. GET THIS! I know cabbage sounds like a boring throwaway course, but it was creamy flavorful perfection. This dish is definitely one of my top dishes I tried in 2019. (Shoutout to our lovely server, also named Carolyn, for the ordering recommendation!)Service was outstanding from start to finish. We felt very well taken care of throughout the meal--and we would expect no less from a $$$$ restaurant with two Michelin stars. I'd mentioned to them that we were celebrating a milestone birthday, and they wished us happy birthday, then later brought out two additional desserts with candles to celebrate. I had a vegan coconut cream dessert filled with fresh mango and kiwi, and my husband had a delicious rich chocolate mousse dessert shaped like a present. Adorable presentation, great taste! The mignardises came out at the end, too, so at one we had six desserts out on the table. We somehow managed to finish it all! I HIGHLY recommend Jean-Georges for lunch and for a special occasion. Tip: Don't forget to dress up! My husband wore a jacket. That being said, we didn't feel the ambiance was snooty or pretentious at all.",0
"I really wanted to like this place because it's not too far and caters to a lot of dietary restrictions which is right up my alley. The ambiance is really pretty with the flowers and the outdoor seating. Even the interior has a great feel to it.Unfortunately the food was only mediocre. I ordered the veggie burger, a slew of fried apps, and a watermelon cocktail. The cocktail was bomb and I would suggest going here for drinks. Less sure on the food -- my burger was very dry and overly rice packed. The apps were ok but the dressing was nauseating. I wasn't stunned by this place, which was disappointing because of the exterior and the seeming hype. I don't think I will be back, especially when there are so many other great restaurants in the area.",0
"I had a wonderful dining experience at Wolfgang's steakhouse. The steak was cooked perfectly and I thought the scale of some of the cuts was impressive. The menu has a variety of items to choose from, so I think it would be best to order family style to take full advantage of it. The restaurant itself is a COVID hotbox - cozy interior, low ceilings, poor ventilation - so it can be a bit noisy, but I still enjoyed my meal. Overall, I would highly recommend Wolfgang's for a quality steak experience.",1
"I dined here last night with my friends for a girls' night. It was my first time at Jue Lan! I will preface this review with a disclaimer that the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I never received my to go order of prawns :( If it weren't for that, 5 stars for sure!Walking towards the restaurant is an experience in and of itself. You basically walk into a church that has been converted into a picturesque dining establishment. The outdoor garden courtyard set up is beautifully adorned with roses and pink umbrellas leading into a dimly lit, intimate, indoor dining area with plush velvet seats, and fun graffiti art. The service was wonderful. Everyone from the greeter at the entrance, to our waitress was friendly and accommodating. I took all of our waitresses' recommendations, and they never failed to disappoint. My favorite dishes were the chicken satay and the spicy samurai salmon crispy rice. The peanut sauce is crack- creamy, almost cheesy goodness. My drink was quite delicious too- very refreshing and also not so bad to look at! I will definitely be making a return soon. I still need to try the prawns!",0
"The B1 Ham Macaroni with Soup, egg sandwich, and tea with milk $5.50 is a great dish to start your meal. The egg sandwich is fluffy and buttery, and the soup is delicious. The Chinese Style Breakfast $5.25 is also a great value. The century egg and pork congee are both good and the Soy sauce chow mein is also good. The chicken chop sandwich is also a good option. Prices are affordable and the food is good. The only downside is that the restaurant can be busy, so expect to wait.",1
"This diner is nothing special, but it's a convenient stop if you're in the middle of the city. The coffee and muffins are mediocre, but I don't hate them. The service could be friendlier, but overall it's a decent place to stop by.",1
"I was here for brunch.  As someone who isn't usually into brunch, I didn't care for the entrees we picked - they were hearty but a little too self conscious and could have focused a bit more on taste TBH, but the desserts and appetizers were both very good!The tea was really expensive for what it was.  And what it was, was the privilege of looking at nicely designed teapots.  Honestly we could barely taste both kinds of tea we ordered.Service had some wrinkles.  Waiters kept mixing up the teas we ordered.  A couple of them reached over me and had some mid air collisions with my arms.  Also the host seemed to have a bit of confusion around seating because I had my doggo with me (cmon guy, outdoor seating always allows dogs).  I think because they're new maybe?I would 100% come back though! And maybe skip the entrees next time I visit.",0
"Gogi 37 is a great Korean restaurant with delicious food. The waiters were polite and helpful, and didn't hover over our table too much. The soondubu stew with tofu was delicious, and the pajeon was a bit greasy but still delicious (a bit more expensive than I would have liked, at $14). I would definitely go back, and my friend who's never been to Korea before loved the hot bibimbap too! They come with little side dishes just like in Korea before your meal, all of which were very good and fresh. Great restaurant all around!",1
"Bread N Wine is a great place to go for a casual night out! They have a student discount until 4pm and happy hour specials until 8pm. The Cuban sandwich I tried was really delicious, with great flavors and a sturdy bread. However, the soup was lackluster - it was definitely missing a depth of flavor (maybe more salt or seasoning). The waitress was incredibly friendly, and there was plenty of seating. The Jazz nights on Wednesdays are a great addition! The all-gender bathroom is a nice touch. Overall, I was really happy with my experience at Bread N Wine.",1
"Grabbed some pizza at Cucina Bene on Tuesday evening. Below average pizza in a shop that was too dirty for the number of customers visiting.Quality: From the moment I first looked at the pizza on display I could tell I was not going to be excited. They did not look attractive and heated up it got no better. The crust on the end was nearly non-existent and hard as a rock. The sauce was extremely salty and it was very light on cheese. The Buffalo Chicken Slice was strips of greasy chicken that did not really heat up and had no buffalo flavor. The Ricotta and Spinach Slice was probably the best of the three I tried as it moved away from their usual sauce and cheese.Quantity: Standard NY Pizza Slice size.Value: $3.00 for a Cheese Slice. $4.00 for Chicken Cutlet Pizza Slice and Ricotta and Spinach Slice.Ambiance: Cucina Bene is down a side street very close to the NY Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Manhattan. The shop is small and easy to miss. Inside it is long and deep with a small eating area up front and the counter in the back right area. They had a single television showing news towards the front and hip-hop music playing in the background.Crowd: One other person in the shop, who was shouting at someone on the phone the entire time.Service: Many of the tables were dirty and covered with trays and plates. The hidden garbage in the front makes it tough for customers to know where to deposit trash and none of the staff seemed interested in cleaning up.Parking: Extremely challenging parking situation.",0
"Came here with friends for dinner. Cute restaurant with a very cozy vibe.We got a bunch of appetizers and bento sets to share. The best appetizers were the seared cow tongue- chewy and nicely smoky, and the chicken karage- flaky and lightly crispy.The bento boxes we got several and one of them was coated Katsu that had a grilling tray so you can put the meat on the tray to grill! Cool idea! My favorite was the eel bento. The teriyaki flavor was great, there was plenty of eel and the rice had eggs mixed in. My favorite!Good fun spot to go to and food quality was good but definitely not a budget spot so more of a treat place so expect to pay up for the quality.",0
"Very friendly staff. Outdoor seating. Delicious brunch. I had the Benedict and my wife had the Carbonara, both were fantastic. I would return. I would like to try the regular menu.",0
"I love Pure Thai for their delicious Thai food. The Chicken Pad Thai is my favorite dish, but I've also had good experiences with the Pad See-Ew. The sides are also great, and they're perfect for take-out. I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"4/22/2021The District has become my restaurant of choice when I'm in NY. It's walking distance from the apartment. The food is always good. With Covid as it is however, even though NY has opened up for having indoor dining, I didn't want to on that day, so we ordered in. I ordered an apple-pecan salad. I personally didn't enjoy the bites of crumbled blue cheese so i took out.  If you like blue cheese, you will really enjoy this salad. The District Burger was the same. Good, though that was my families order. And the wings were ordered Buffalo, but they sent the sauce for covering. I guess that make sense. We also ordered a cheese cake to share. It was awful. Stale, old. I called to inform them and they refunded me the money for the cost of it. She was very pleasant when calling and apologized several times. Would I eat at The District again? YesHappy Eats",0
"I had a great experience at Balthazar Restaurant on July 4th. The place wasn't crowded at all, and we waited an hour for our food in between our appetizers and our main meal. The steak frites was tough but well seasoned. Not worth it, but the busboy was excellent, however. Very attentive.",1
"What we ordered | Pun Sib Salmon ($13) Chicken Satay ($11) Pad Thai ($15)Panang Curry ($17) Thai Tea ($5)Taste | the salmon was in a puff pastry, which tasted great. the pad thai was very saucy and the portions were good for all the dishes. panang curry was a little too soupy for me. they also gave a complimentary soup when we started. The dishes we tried were good, but nothing too different in flavor from what we have in California. Service | servers were awesome, very attentive. Parking | Street Note | joined the waitlist and waited about an 1.5 hours. they gave us a call when our table was ready a little earlier than anticipated. ambiance was beautiful in here.",0
"Mafaldini - Shrimp Scampi: 
-The shrimp are crunchy and plentiful, with a great citrus flavor from the lemon juice. The pasta is cooked to perfection (Al dente).
-The tuna crudo is also excellent, with a nice flavor profile.
-The octopus is delicious, with a delicate flavor. I wouldn't change a thing about it.
-The panna cotta is also a nice finish to the meal. The watermelon is a refreshing touch.

Overall, I had a great experience at Mafaldini. The shrimp scampi is my favorite dish, but the tuna crudo and octopus are also excellent. The modern and beautiful decor is a plus, and I would recommend stopping by for dinner.",1
"Came here with a group of guys and ordered over 10 different dishes and every plate was clean by the end. From the naan to the Lamb Curry to chicken Biryani, each dish was packed with flavor and aroma. The restaurant is small but welcoming India restaurant with great service and warm vibes. The portion is average and the price is completely reasonable as well. I would recommend coming with a group and order different dishes and share it family style.",0
"Going to be honest here, don't give 5 stars unless I really think the establishment earned it, and this diner earned it with their vanilla milkshake! So delicious!Otherwise, overall a 4.5/5 star experience but will round up for the milkshake.Service - very attentive, sometimes too quick but that's how it is at peak time on a Sunday for brunch!Food - pretty delicious, got the 3-egg omelette combo (Italian omelette) - the toast was kinda cold and the potatoes were lacking a bit but overall it was freshly made and better than another diner I recently had in the area, as well.Overall, loved the vibes of this place and my date and I are definitely going to be returning (with another milkshake of course!)",0
"I was really excited to try Gebhard's Beer Culture, especially after reading the great reviews online. I was not disappointed! The atmosphere is really cool and eclectic, and it has a really fun, retro vibe. The low ceilings and high tops add to the feeling of being in a basement, pub, or medieval castle all at the same time. The service was good and the bartenders were knowledgeable about the beer list. My Vegan Mushroom Tacos with Tofu 'aioli' were delicious, and the ginormous pretzel was warm and chewy. This spot has a really cool crowd going, and I'm definitely looking forward to coming back.",1
I visited this restaurant for a quick bite and I was really impressed! The atmosphere is cozy and the service was great. My food arrived quickly and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Italian meal.,1
"I had a great time at the Ivan Orkin restaurant! The mazemen and pastrami buns were amazing, and the yuzu lemonade was perfect. I would definitely come back.",1
"Wait, how does this place have good reviews? In the land of never-ending pizza, this place should not be on anyone's radar. John's is LITERALLY the next block over. We only went because John's was closed, and this place had good reviews so we thought, why not? The pizza was crunchy but not doughy. It simply tasted like you reheated a pizza in a pan (could do this at home.) In their defense, almost every pizza place does this, but it just didn't taste fresh anymore. All the ingredients tasted separated and didn't mesh well together. The tomato sauce wasn't cooked through and tasted like it was from a can. The cheese did not melt or string well from the pie. I got the Nonna, but there wasn't anything different about theirs except the lack of quality. Tasted like a regular margherita.I would choose a nearby Little Italy over this for late night, quick pizza. Better quality and cheaper!",0
"Came in about half an hour early than reservation time on the 26th. Was told we couldn't be sat early bc of the menu change from lunch to dinner despite lots of available tables. After waiting for reservation time, our party of 3 was sat at entrance where the fans made it hard to have a conversation, again despite lots of a available tables throughout the restaurant. Bc we had a reservation & waited for it, we asked to be moved and were sat at a table more towards the center of the restaurant. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to approach us and flagged down someone for service. Between our party of 3, we had 4 drinks, the Caesar salad, tartare, tomahawk, creamed spinach, fries and chocolate mousse. Drinks, sides, steak & dessert were okay; salad and tartare were great. Service continued to be lackluster throughout the meal. No one asked about the drinks / food and only time we were approached really was when we were asked whether we wanted to order another cocktail. TL;DR - food is serviceable but subpar service, whether it be from hostess or waiter. Go somewhere else where service is pleasant to complement your setting and meal.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good. I didn't really remember what we all got, but it all looked yummy. The atmosphere is definitely very sports bar-like - it's really loud in there, so it's not the best place to have a conversation. But it's a great place to just relax and have a drink with your friends.",1
"Non Solo Piada is a great small Italian restaurant in the Garment District. The food is great and the prices are reasonable. The only downside is that they do not have indoor seating, but they have a great outdoor area. It is great for a quick lunch or dinner.",1
"I had a wonderful experience at La Grande Boucherie! The decor is gorgeous, and it was great to see that the restaurant invests in making the full restaurant experience possible. The service was top-notch, and the food was incredible. I especially loved the braised beef - it was super flavorful and tender. I can't wait to go back for the full experience!",1
"Blue Fin is located in Times Square, so at a very touristy area which means increased prices for mediocre food. But my friend's work is near here and wanted to treat all of us to sushi. We had a reservation at 5pm on Friday night and were seated immediately. Here is what I ordered: *ROLLED SUSHI*-Truffle Rainbow Roll ($19) -West Side Roll ($17) which consists of eel, spicy tuna, grilled pineapple, and cucumber Sushi was good, but not worth $17-$19. *STARTERS*-Classic Maine Lobster Bisque ($14) Very, very creamy. *DESSERT*-Warm Gala Apple Crostata ($11) This was most underwhelming dessert. Only the ice cream was good. Overall, it was an unimpressive experience. We appreciated the attention from our waitress but she was too attentive. She asked how everything was every 10 minutes or so throughout our meal which interrupted our dinner conversation many times. I also did not appreciate how our host was vacuuming right next to us while we were eating. Honestly if it was something I'd pay for myself, I wouldn't come here: very overpriced for very average food. It's just not worth it.",0
"Sloooooow service. We didn't even come at a busy time. It was 5pm on a Thursday. There was one guy seating people and taking orders and bringing the check. There were 7 different people bringing food and drink. It's a huge space but even in this Covid time they seated the 5 tables that were there at the time all in one corner all next to each other. Not a fan. It's an average burger bar. They didn't have any beers on tap when I went. Unfortunate. The classic bills burger was dry and nothing special. However, the keto burger was really good. Add extra hot sauce that's on the table and it's divine. I'm not even keto. But I do like meat. Has literally all the meats they offer on there plus a fried egg. The menu said it also came with avocado but they didn't give me any. Regardless, it was more moist, saucier, and tastier than the classic burger. Try it. My boyfriend got the classic and ate it because he doesn't waste food. But he immediately ordered a second keto burger for himself. That was his only meal of the day. And we didn't order fries because I'm against burger places that don't include fries with any order of a burger. Don't go out of your way to come here.",0
"I visited Senza Gluten in the West Village and was impressed by the beautiful setting and delicious food. Everything on the menu is gluten free, which is great for those with dietary restrictions. I ordered the New York Strip Steak Sandwich and was pleased with the quality of the meat and the delicious toppings. The only downside was that the steak was a bit small and the bread was a bit dry. The side salad and roasted potatoes were also good. I particularly enjoyed the melted cheese on the sandwich. The Chocolate Molten Cake was also delicious, and the almond cream anglaise was a nice touch. The service was good and the servers were attentive. I would definitely recommend Senza Gluten to others.",1
"I honestly don't know what happened to this place. Sushi was amazing during my first visit, but my second visit was completely the opposite; it was my worst sushi experience. Upon entering, no one greeted us so we were just awkwardly standing by the counter for few minutes. It already started off negatively-- For dinner, we got the Natsumi Sushi Sashimi Set ($72) and 2 pieces of Toro Fatty Tuna (m/p). I was utterly disappointed with the sushi rice; it was extremely dry and flavorless. Because of this problem, my rolls and sushi pieces were all low quality. I had to also spit out some pieces of fish because they were icy cold. Overall, for over $100, we expected somewhat good quality sushi, but ultimately left in disappointment. We won't be returning; there are so many better sushi restaurants in the city.",0
"Overall, the food was delicious and the delivery time was super fast! I just wished that the bowl of pad thai looked a bit fuller when it arrived. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Spice to others.",1
"I had a decent meal at Chili, but I don't think it was particularly unique or worth the price. The food was made well, but I don't think it was anything special. The location is nice, but I would rather go to Chinatown for a better meal. 3.5/5",1
"first come first serve! I came here with a friend and we waited about 10 minutes for a seat. mind you, it was a Tuesday at 6:30! I've seen longer on weekends. we decided to go all out and get the six rolls! 100% recommend. it lets you just about try everything. they ran out of rice half way through and gave us a free app to wait. hehe can never say no to free food! I'd come again for sure - left satisfied!",0
"We stopped by this place on our way to Grand Central. It I lived or worked in the neighborhood, I'd come back.  This place makes Chinese food for Chinese people. Northern Chinese - a mix of Shanghainese & northern provinces. So no dim sum or typical ""American Chinese"" food. I would try the noodles (usually the safest thing in a new place) and branch out to the vegetables before going for the meats.",0
"I don't get all the negative reviews, the staff are plenty friendly and helpful. There isn't much room to stand inside - and they're sometimes out of beer, cups, and straws - but the experience is fine and the pizza is justifiably legendary. The flavors and textures all very very rich, kind of like Detroit style (though this is clearly Sicilian style). So, I wouldn't call this a go-to neighborhood spot; Sal & Carmine's down the street is better for a light and perfect daily slice. This is definitely destination, once-a-month type pizza.",0
"The tacos were great, the Caesar salad was fresh and the guacamole was some of the best I've had. The salsa was just ok but the guacamole was some of the best I've had. The only downside was the tortilla soup didn't have the ""kick"" I was expecting. The service was excellent and we were able to get out of there quickly to catch a concert at MSG.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant before seeing a Broadway show with a friend. The decor is really cute, and it wasn't too noisy or busy inside. The Chicken Lemon Soup was a great portion, and I really enjoyed it. The Greek sandwich was a little small, but I could tell the meat quality was good. I decided to get the french fries on the side instead, but next time I might try it inside. My friend tried the lamb chops and she was really pleased. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a quaint, quiet place to eat.",1
"Angry Nonna is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for some delicious square slices! The crust is thick and crunchy, and the sauce and toppings are spot on - definitely one of our favorites. However, we didn't love our house slice as much - it was a bit bland for our taste. But the pear was definitely a standout - it was refreshing and delicious.",1
"There is no way I could find myself in NYC for the better part of a whole week and not treat myself to New York style pizza. Even though I am currently on a diet that is proving successful; at least up until now.The ladies next to us we're actually knife band forking their pies and I kept waiting for them to burst into flames.Don't bother getting your empty iced tea glass all primed for a refill (just amount of sweetner or lemon) because they will bring you a new fresh glass.Find it funny that you can be sitting in a place like this and call up the Yelp app, queue it up for finding a restaurant and find that the place you are sitting in isn't even on the first full list of suggested placed. I guess that's why they call it an algorithm, right? Tons of good reviews on this place and they appear to be accurate. One comment regarding rock hard bread....cry me a river",0
"Emporio definitely has a great atmosphere - even during these hard times. The staff was very accommodating and the tables are definitely spaced far enough apart so that you can't hear your neighbors. The food was absolutely fantastic - we ordered the rigatoni, the squid ink pasta, and the prosciutto pizza. The rigatoni with mushroom, sausage, and truffle was creamy and well balanced. The squid ink pasta had so much seafood and the spaghetti was perfectly al dente. Any pizza with prosciutto and arugula is a winner, but this pizza was everything I could ask for - perfect crust and just balanced toppings!",1
"Unexpected fun time at the Cantina Rooftop for Sunday brunch. Prices are pretty on par with Manhattan brunch specials, so no surprise there. Although we made a reservation beforehand it still took some time for us to get seated. Seeing that this is a popular spot. Although we were starving, once we sat down, the service was top-notch and our server made sure our drinks were constantly filled (during our 90-minute bottomless option). The rooftop also is nice, with the right kind of weather, and the skyscrapers serving as a backdrop. The DJ was also pretty impressive, as he switched flawlessly through all different kinds of genres. I would return. I just hope next time it doesn't take so long to get seated.",0
"We had a blast at this restaurant! The staff was so nice and the atmosphere was great - it had a really fun vibe. We were seated near the front, which was perfect because we were able to talk without being too loud. The food was amazing, and we can't wait to come back!",1
"Grabbed dinner with friends here on a Friday night. A smaller, intimate restaurant but had outdoor heated seating. Service was good but food to me was okay- wasn't horrible but wasn't amazing. Portions are on the smaller side, taco order came with two but were bite sized and drinks tasted watered down. Had churros for dessert which was good and had chocolate to dip in! Overall wouldn't go out of my way to come back here as I think there are other better Mexican restaurants in the area.",0
"Wandered here on a Saturday afternoon looking for a decent brunch spot with outside seating. Got a nice table in the shade and was immediately given menus/water when we sat down.Interesting Brunch Special which nets you an entree, coffee or tea, and an alcoholic beverage for $22. Went for the Breakfast Wrap, coffee, and a Bloody Mary. Coffee comes first - a generous pour of hot coffee with refills to boot. Bloody Mary is next - lots of hot sauce and a solid amount of booze; wish it was larger but can't complain with the price. As for the food, the fries are deliciously crisp and the wrap/burrito is hefty (lots of eggs and meat). Only downside were the greens to the side which didn't taste fresh. Pro tip - they give more fries if you don't want the salad.Really liked the service and food here, as well as the reasonable pricing. A welcome change of pace from the normal brunch places.",0
"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The minimalistic décor and zen atmosphere was perfect, and the servers were very attentive and friendly. The food came out at a good pace and the chicken tatsuta-age was delicious. I especially loved the kani ankake udon - the noodles had a very chewy texture and the soup had a deep flavor. The curry, gyunan, and niku broths were all very soothing and flavorful. The food here is of very high quality, and I would definitely recommend treating yourself to a meal here. Just be careful not to burn your mouth and throat out of excitement!",1
Our daughter has celiac so we were happy to find this place.  Very friendly lady at register.  Food was fairly priced and was made quickly.  Love the indoor seating and that they verify vaccination.,0
I got the wings with no sauce which were soooo good!! Crispy and savory!! We enjoyed the shrimp tacos too! We especially loved our frozen margaritas to go !! I asked for my chicken taco but I got a beef on accident that was the only downfall as I can't eat beef so I just gave it to my boyfriend... other than that I will be returning!!,0
"This restaurant is terrible. I placed an order on MealPal and went to pick up my order at the noted time frame. I told multiple workers about my order but other people, including other MealPal orders and On-the-spot orders were taken care of before me. I was standing there, well over 15 minutes. I was so angry. I think it was mainly the lack of concern and care. And other customers noticed to. They ordered after me and somehow received their food. Then I overheard the manager say they didn't have grilled chicken. Why not be honest and speak to me directly, let me know or offer me an alternate solution? They were serving tons of fried chicken sandwiches. Why not just offer me that option so I could leave? Then eventually a worker offered me a drink and tater tots, which was nice. When I finally got my food I checked the bag for the tater tots and it wasn't there. So I ask the worker for it and they acted surprised. You make me wait 15/20 minutes and the least you could do is offer me tater tots and you ask if I still want it? What planet am I on? I'm hungry. I'm angry. I was ignored. I waited",1
"I work often at the Mount Sinai hospital, and this is ideally located between several of the main buildings. Unfortunately I've only had the opportunity to try lunch, because I don't often get to this area in the evening, but I wish I did! They have a fantastic selection of fresh delicious seafood and Italian favorites. I have enjoyed their kale salad with grilled shrimp, woodfired pizzas, and grilled octopus. All of which were fantastic!! Can't wait to get back and try more!! Highly recommend!!",0
"I had a great experience at Ben and Jack's Restaurant Week Prix Fixe Menu! The French Onion Soup was my favorite dish - it was very savory and had a whole layer of melted cheese on top. I also enjoyed the Fried Calamari - it was crispy on the outside and had a great dipping sauce. The Petite Filet Mignon was also good - it came out medium rare and was very filling. The Carrot Cake was also a great choice - it wasn't too sweet and they gave you whipped cream on the side. The only downside was that the service was a bit slow, but overall I had a great time at Ben and Jack's.",1
"I had a good outdoor dining experience @ Dos Caminos earlier today. The outdoor dining setup here is very nice. There is lots of space between tables and 20+ tables in total. As for food, I ordered guac, fish taco and chopped salad. All three dishes were delicious. My favorite was definitely grilled fish taco: it was so flavorful, and the fish meat was so tender! There were also large chunks of avocado in the tacos, which made every bite very enjoyable. The guac and the salad were also well made. Definitely good value for the affordable price point. Service is the only part that kind of disappointed. Our server never checked on us and it was really hard to get her attention for extra water/plate/check. All in all, despite the low rating @ yelp, I do enjoy DC's food and think it is worth a visit",0
"Electric Lemon is a great place to go for a night out with friends. The service is always amazing and the drinks are always delicious. I've been to the restaurant twice now and I definitely won't be my last. The first time I came, I brought my mom and sister and we ordered a whole bunch of delicious meals. The service was amazing and we felt extremely taken care of. All the dishes we ordered were impeccable and immaculate. We were seated by the windows at a booth and couldn't have enjoyed the Manhattan skyline more. My mom and sister loved the experience and we would surely come again. The second time was for a NYE celebration and the service and the drinks were amazing! Would come again for future events.",1
"I love cheung fun (腸粉) -- Cantonese-style rice noodle rolls. So I'm super happy that dedicated rice noodle roll shops have been popping up all over New York City.Tonii's Fresh Rice Noodle makes great rice noodles -- the best I've ever had -- silky smooth and soft in texture, that combine excellently with sauce. However, the filings inside the regular rice noodles are lacking. We ordered three rice noodle rolls for our first visit -- Beef, Roast Pork, and Tonii's Special (pork, chicken, dried shrimp). The filings seemed barely there, and were even less noticeable after sauce was applied. The roast pork didn't taste right, and unfavorably influenced the flavor of its rice noodle roll. There are options to add more filings, such as an egg or extra meat, which I highly recommend.Overall Rating: 3.75 of 5. Tonii's does an excellent job with its rice noodles and while they are definitely worth a try, other places offer an easier and more substantive default ""out-of-box experience.""As a bonus, since Tonii's is related to Kam Hing Coffee Shop, it is possible to get Kam Hing's wonderful sponge cakes at Tonii's.",0
"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at this restaurant! It was really trendy and cool, and the disco music was perfect for the setting. I also really appreciated that ordering was easy and that you don't have to wait for a waiter - I just picked what I wanted and paid as I went. The food was solidly mediocre, but I thought the drink I had was good. Overall, I thought it was worth a visit, but I'm not sure I would go back for food.",1
"If I didn't know any better, I would have given Fedoroff's 4 stars. After all, aside from the peppers being sloppily placed outside of my cheesesteak, there wasn't much to be unhappy with. Taste. The flavors were all there. The steak was good quality, similar to Philly level. However, the onions, of which there was a small portion inside the sandwich, were chopped large and under-caramelized. The cheese wiz was smeared on top of the sandwich like an afterthought and did not blend with the meat as well as it should have. The bread was a bit dry, a situation that could have been avoided with more and better placed cheese wiz in the sandwich. Prices. Well they are expensive for your typical lunch. If you are getting a large cheesesteak without any fries, that'll cost you $12 after taxes. That being said, it is hard to get cheesesteak for a cheaper price in NY. Portions. Not as big as your traditional Philly cheesesteak. They have a half sandwich portion for those who don't want to pig out for lunch, but honestly the half sandwich is more expensive for what you get and is not filling enough for one person.",0
"This place is great for grabbing a quick banh mi sandwich on the go, but I would recommend coming during the day since it's a bit of a noisy and cramped environment at night. The sandwiches are really affordable and they always have a good selection of fillings. The only downside is that they don't have any seating, so it's best to just grab your food and go.",1
"Stopped in on a hot Saturday afternoon lured by the HH poster only to discover happy hour is Monday thru Friday.  Already anticipating a cool experience Sis and I proceeded inside. SN- I wish places would stop doing this. We literally got ""caught"" by misleading Happy Hour signs twice this day.  Capitalizing off my skim reading/ wanting to have a sip...smhI had a delicious mule drink. I like sweet, tart, hint of heat from pepper drinks. Our apps were waffle fries and sushi- both delish. The setting intimate trendy and the staff bubbly. Didn't leave an impression, wasn't bad either. If I do return it'd be on a whim, not because I planned beforehand",0
"Overall, I had a decent brunch at this restaurant. The wrap was a bit heavy on the goat cheese, but the eggs and veggies were all solid. The service was quick and the guy behind the bar was able to get our refills without much wait. The only downside is that it can get a bit noisy in the restaurant during peak brunch times.",1
"For someone that is super picky with food, and is health-conscious, I'm surprised that I've gone so long without trying Poke. Well, one evening I decided it was time to try it out. I searched on my UberEats app, and found Hula Poke to be a good option.I ordered the Samurai Poke, with three scoop of salmon slices over a bed of brown rice and vegetables.The meal was amazingly good. The dressing they used added a ton of flavor, and the salmon portion was decent. I was left both satisfied and impressed by this meal. Poke is now in my radar. The next time I am looking for a light and delicious meal, I will give Hula Poke another go.",0
"I was so happy that we ended up coming here last minute on a busy Friday night! Everything sounded so good on the menu, and we decided to try the following:

-PULPO AL OLIVO: grilled octopus, corn, peruvian purple potatoes, olive aioli. The octopus was so tender, meaty, and flavorful - it was a great starter!

-SECO NORTENO (for 2): beef short ribs slow-braised for 12 hours, beans, yuca, in a cilantro sauce, with white rice. WOW. The beef short ribs were so tender and really flavorful, and it was really hearty. It's definitely something that I would love to have again!

-GOAT CHEESE SALAD: mixed greens, goat cheese, pomegranate seeds. This was a nice side to our meaty main dish.

-ALGARROBINA TRES LECHES: cool and creamy tres leches cake, slightly sweet for my taste, but still very very good.

-CHOCOLATE MOUSSE: with chocolate crumble and raspberries. It was perfectly smooth, rich, and decadent.

"Overall, I thought Parm was mediocre. The pasta was clumpy and lacked flavor, and the chicken parm sandwich was good but not great. I wouldn't recommend it.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch on a recent Saturday and was pleased with the casual atmosphere. I was able to get a seat without a reservation, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our table was full of food by the time we were done, and I especially enjoyed the beet gnocchi, duck, and fried artichokes. I also enjoyed the gelato for dessert. Overall, a great experience.",1
"Had brunch here with my friends this wknd. Nice vibes and tasty food.  Pros: --Bar tender/server (Conner) was super nice and helpful--we didn't have a reservation, but we were seated quickly at the bar--food was really good, and the perfect portion to be able to finish it all. --$18 bottomless mimosa Cons: --no coat check--a bit crowded, but I guess that's par for the course in the area. We really enjoyed this spot, and I can see myself returning.",0
"I absolutely love this restaurant for their intestine! The price is reasonable, and they have a variety of options to choose from. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for intestine in the city.",1
"John's is an excellent choice for a quick bite in the City. The restaurant is large and tables are spaced properly, making it easy to find a seat. The staff is quick to take care of customers and the food is delicious. I recommend the Margherita pizza, which is perfect for those with dietary restrictions.",1
"Street Taco is a great place for Mexican food in Manhattan. The tacos are delicious, and the margaritas are perfect. The only downside is that the restaurant is limited in seating, so it can get quite busy.",1
"An okay hotpot place on saint marks. We came in on a thursday night - a party of 2. Hostess asked is if we minded sharing a table and we asked how long the wait would be. She said 45 mins so we agreed to share a table. Went down to the basement where there were many empty tables- I guess they were saving for larger groups? Due to the layout of the restaurant, it was a bit awkward sharing a table. We were sat in a booth and it was hard to order and eating w strangers so closely can be a tad bit awkward.I got the pork bone broth which was kinda flavorless and the texture of the fatty beef was very stringy, and cut into very small pieces.The drinks were good! I loved the watermelon Juice. It was so refreshing. Sauce bar had a great variety of sauces but some of them were empty and no one refilled.",0
"I went to Union Square Kitchen with a friend last night and it was okay. The drink we had at the bar was pretty good, but the apps are pretty expensive for just three little dumplings. The beef BBQ combo was good, but the beer was skunky. Overall, I'd go back if I had a friend who was really eager about it, but there are a lot better restaurants in New York.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is really beautiful and it's perfect for a summer lunch or dinner. The service was great and the food was fresh and well-crafted. I especially loved the poke and the lobster Mac and cheese. I definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good meal!,1
"I had a great experience at Covid-19! The outdoor seating was perfect, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered two entrees on the menu of the day and both were delicious. The shrimp tacos were especially good, but I had high expectations. The beer menu was big, but they didn't have our first three choices so we went with what they had available. The lamb was so big that I only ate half and wanted to pack the rest to go. However, when our server came back with the bill he said someone already dumped it out. So they gave us 1 beer for free. The bill came out to around $100 for two before tips. I would definitely recommend Covid-19 to anyone looking for a great restaurant experience.",1
"This is a great vegetarian, kosher and gluten free friendly Chinese/dim sum restaurant in a relatively hidden but busy street of Chinatown. I've come here twice on the weekends and was seated immediately both times. The restaurant is very spacious, but tables are close to each other.  There is a substantial amount of fake meat on the menu, and I was surprised by how good they tasted. I highly recommend getting the BBQ pork dish. I also tried the general tso's vegetarian chicken, which was also surprisingly delicious. The menu is huge, so there is truly something for everyone. For the less adventurous, there are always lo mein and fried rice dishes. Everything is super flavorful, and portion sizes are good.",0
"The food was decent, but the broth was really bland. The potstickers were oily and not crunchy enough, and the noodles were also not very flavorful. The staff was friendly and let me go to the Chase ATM right around the corner, but be aware that this restaurant is cash only.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the gnocchi, the sushi rolls, and the king crab dumplings. The only downside was that the dumplings were a bit too chewy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Bill's Bar & Burger is a great place to go for a burger. The variations on the burger theme are really creative and the burger itself is delicious. The only downside is that it can be a bit chaotic to check in, but the wait isn't too long. The fries are really bland, though.",1
Got the mushroom soon tofu at level spicy and asked them to make it vegetarian (no meat broth or fish sauce). They asked if egg was okay and I said yes. The soon tofu was so delicious and a good level of heat (not too much). The banchan was great too though I steered clear of the fish tofu and kimchi (usually has shrimp). Glad to have some tasty veggie options at a Korean place when I'm with meat-eating friends. It's usually pretty hard to come by.Staff was incredibly nice & all wore masks! They had plastic curtain barriers between the tables and hand sanitizer available on each table too. Indoor dining only.,0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good, but it did suffer a bit because it was takeout. The customer service was great, though, and they were very accommodating in terms of making sure I was okay with the ginger soup. The quality of the food definitely suffers because it's not as fresh, but it's still edible. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"If I could give a 3.5 stars I would. It was just okay. I wouldn't recommend waiting for more than a 30 minute in line for it. We got the margarita pizza and thee vodka sauce. I'd say pass on the vodka one, it's very light in flavor. The margarita one was slightly better. The tomato sauce wasn't too tart, and the cheese tasted really good with it. However it is only a couple dollars so what more can you expect? Inside is really cramped and not much room to stand and eat. The menu is super hard to read and the staff all seemed pretty unenthusiastic with the crowds. I like Suprema Pizza more!",0
"The Rasta pasta ... you can not be serious. For some reason this is one of those dishes that are hard to find, and when you do find it, it's hard for the business to cook it correctly.  What was that?  Seriously. On the contrary, the jerked chicken was cooked to perfection. If they tweak their Rasta pasta recipe, the two paired together would be magical.",0
"I came here with friends on a very hot day.  The temperature in the restaurant could have been cooler. The place was pretty full. Inside and outside with covid precautions in place.  This was the first time I've been to Lamia's brunch but I have eaten here before and had a different experience.  The drinks were good and my chicken sandwich was good and for $35  with drinks your getting a great deal. However, I don't know if it was because of the nice weather and everyone trying to get outside but Lamia was running out of glasses. I was pretty much drinking out of a glass I would drink  soda out of. It's the little things . Anywho this was a cute place, good to go with friends and it's certainly affordable and the drinks were good.I would likely come back.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The gnocchi was my favorite item, but the tiramisu was also really good. The atmosphere was really cute and I could tell that the staff was really friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Phenom British pub food in the UES!While it is easy to find typical bar food in NYC, it isn't so easy to find British pub fare, but Jones Wood Foundry certainly delivers. Their menu alone took me back to my visit to the UK, but the décor and setup in here was the icing on the cake. The front bar is dimly lit (and packed pre-COVID), and as you walkthrough to the main dining area, you'll spot a quaint but lovely garden space. I absolutely love the indoor/outdoor concept.For our mains, we ordered the Fish and Chips (because how can you pass this up at a pub?) and the Roast Chicken which (I think) the waitress mentioned was tea-infused, and extremely tender. Both entrees were a bit pricey (about $25 each), but SO good. I will say that I assumed the Fish and Chips would come with smashed peas in addition to fries, but oh well. We left satisfied, but not overly full. I think ordering an app or dessert in addition to our entrée would have done the trick. Still a very solid experience and we were impressed with the quality of the food.I can't wait to return for the Sticky Toffee Pudding and to dine in the garden!",0
"I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and need to catch a performance at Lincoln Center. The wait times can be long, but the hostess was able to get us a table within 5 minutes after explaining our time constraints. The food was good, but the prices are a bit high for lunch. The Brussels sprouts were my favorite dish - it was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. We were able to leave the restaurant in 40 minutes from when we walked in. Overall, a great experience.",1
"I have admired Little Frog for a long time. It is very cute and always has quite a crowd so I knew it must be good. We ordered pinot noir which was delicious and paired well with the charcuterie board. However, I was not super impressed with the charcuterie board... it did not seem worth $32. But my meal was delicious, so that made up for it (and one of the reasons Little Frog deserves four stars and not three!) I ordered the Scottish Salmon Tataki and it was very tasty. My boyfriend wished he ordered the same thing - he had the Jumbo Lump Crab Salad. Our server was absolutely wonderful, very friendly and sweet.",0
"I really wanted to love Genesis House, but I was left quite disappointed. The interior and venue is stunning, but the night time lighting was minimal. The wait staff were great, but the food was just okay -- nothing spectacular. However, the $150 price point didn't justify the just okay food. The first dish (suranchae) was probably the only course that was actually good, while to dessert was interesting. The rest were uninspiring for the price point. The tuna was overpowered by the cilantro, the grilled sirloin was seemingly a better presented Korean bbq dish, the tofu rice wasn't anything special.",1
"I visited Joes in Times Square and while the pizza was certainly popular, I found it to be average at best. The crust was hard and the pizza was cold, which didn't make for the best dining experience. The celebrity pictures on the wall were a nice touch though.",1
"Sylvia's finally re opened and I was eager to try harlems most famous soul food joint. I fortunately the reviews are right: it's very expensive (23-28$/plate) , the wait is long and it's just ok taste wise. The fried chicken was alright, nothing special compared to kfc but nothing compared to willie maes scotch house in Nola. The smothered pork chops were cooked well but not as tender as they could be (m&m in LA has you beat easily)The collared greens were very good and that's why it's 2 stars honestly. The service was nice but very slow. First 20 minute wait outside then another 15 minutes before one of waiters chose to ask if I'm ready to order. I would have gotten 3 times the food for $60 at soul food places nearby. So I won't be back there.",0
Icy cold noodles are served here year round and delicious. It's our go-to place for cold noodles.,0
"I got delivery from El Aguila, which was super fast. The taste was good but the meat was, unfortunately, all dry, which really took away from the enjoyability of the food. I ordered the following off of UberEats: -Non-spicy marinated pork taco (Pastor) ($3)-Roasted pork taco ($3)-Grilled Beef Chopped Steak Taco ($4)-Fresh Grilled Chicken Taco ($3)The portions were great and I was stuffed by the third taco.",0
"I visited O'Lunney's on a Saturday afternoon and was the only person in the restaurant. The burgers were good, and the price point was reasonable. The waiter was friendly and checked on me regularly. I would definitely visit O'Lunney's again.",1
"I had a great time at the Chineese restaurant. The specials were really affordable and the food was really good. The only downside was that the service was a bit slow, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and filling lunch.",1
"Burger & Lobster had a lot of potential, but the overall atmosphere was not very pleasing. The appetizers were good, but the main course didn't quite live up to expectations. The service was good, but it would have been nice to be called when our table was ready. Overall, I thought the food was good, but I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I trekked all the way to Sun Hing Lung after coming in on a redeye flight with little sleep and an empty stomach.  The reviews from my fellow Yelpers convinced me it was worth it.There was a short line at the window when I arrived.  Thank goodness there as a line because this place is located in an industrial area and I could have been walking up and down the block looking for the place. I ordered beef cheung fun.  They make all orders fresh and the food was ready in about 5 minutes.  I added soy sauce and peanut sauce to my noodle rolls.  The food was really good, fresh and hot but I found the filling to be on the skimpy side.  However, for $2 per order (cash only), I'm not complaining.There are a couple of places (steps, doorfronts) that you could sit on nearby and you could also eat while standing near the condiment area but a few of us took our food to the park down the street and ate at the benches.",0
"Walking toward NY Comic Con, I felt that all too familiar grumbling from my belly.  I saw Chirp on the way and dropped in to grab a bite.Ambience:  a few small tables in a cozy dining room.  This is set up like a takeout, where you order at the counter, take your food to a table and clean up after yourself.Food:  the Peruvian chicken was well seasoned and tasty.  Be sure to ask for extra green sauce.TL/DR:  a delicious, delightful, and relatively inexpensive lunch in midtown NYC.",0
"I've been coming to docks quite a bit over the past couple years, mainly because it's close to the home of my relatives in new york, and because my dad likes it.I don't know how many years this place has been here, but it's been here as long as I can remember. The space is very large and open, but normally it's fairly busy, so I'm not positive you'll be able to get a table. Being in midtown, and being a slightly more upscale restaurant, people are usually here for a longer dinner, and usually in larger parties. I'd recommend this sort of place for a larger, post celebration type of dinner, rather than a more intimate one-on-one type place.Normally, I get the lobster roll, though they have other things here. It's pretty good honestly, just really expensive. The same goes for the oysters, which I also frequently get. I suppose it's sort of just... midtown prices? So I'm okay with that. However, for what you pay, I think the quality is just fine.I expect to be here many more times in the future.",0
"The restaurants' aesthetic is very appealing, and the service was good. However, the food was overpriced and lacked flavor. Additionally, the restaurant's policy of requiring guests to order their food and drinks separately was inconvenient.",1
"I love the banh mi sandwich here! The crunchy bread and veg are paired with chewy pork, and the hot sauce really makes it taste great. I always go for the number 1 with extra hot sauce added. I would definitely recommend this sandwich to anyone!",1
"I had a good time at Tokidoki, especially the waygu beef ramen burger. The ramen is good for the price, but I had better ramen for cheaper. The organization is horrible, though. They should be more organized for an event. In all honesty, if you are in groups they should let anyone go inside unless there's a group waiting, which is usually the case at places like this. Especially when the place is already crowded. There was a family with two kids that got seated before me, and people before me who complained about how they had to go back to work if they could just get the bowl and leave. So they also got the bowls.",1
"I highly recommend Singas for a great personal pan pizza. These pies are cooked in a pan, which makes all the difference and makes them so much more flavorful. I can't wait to order from here again!",1
I reunited with a foodie gal pal after 7 months and she was craving the lobster pasta here. We did outdoor dining. Service was busy. I ordered the scallops with pork belly dish. It was very good. Unfortunately they are no longer serving that dish in the restaurant. The seafood dishes are definitely worth getting. We shared an appetizer of spinach pies which was small. We also dessert and I ordered tea to go and the pot it was served in was pretty and heavy. I would definitely return to try their Santorini Sunday prix fixe menu.,0
I ordered The Harvest. It's worth the hype. Really good cheesecake pot. The cheesecake is creamy and a whipped texture. I was really craving cookie crumbles and this has crumbled Oreo on top. The raspberry sorbet pairs nicely as well as the raspberry sauce. Cute presentation as well..Broke my diet for this lol,0
"How does anyone not love Via Carota? Impossible prime time dinner reservations and we hadn't had much luck with weekend walk ins but finally on a summer Thursday at 5:30 we Ubered over and were immediately seated to enjoy the really, really great meal we had anticipated. The prosciutto burrata was dreamy. Melt in your mouth tender prosciutto and luscious, creamy burrata. Regretted not ordering a second. The artichoke was also greatness. All the fibrous parts hacked away to leave flavorful seasoned bites for us to enjoy. Strangely the cacio e pepe wasnt our fav, good but completely outshined by the tortelli. Gooey, delicious caramelized onions over ricotta stuffed pasta was exceptional! The server explained that everything there is just simple, good food - and he was right, simple, really good ingredients are the magic of this place.",0
"Background story (what is new?). I have a dear friend who is not only a really good friend, but I also met many wonderful people through her. However, one of my newly made friend and her had a bit of a fall out. I remained Switzerland and did not get involved not because I wanted to avoid the drama, but mostly because it is tax season and I haven't had the time to breathe. Anyways, the two decided to grab dinner and talk about it. My friend was a bit in a bad mood about something else and I didn't want that to make things worse, so I decided to tag along. It was a bit awkward, but I gotta say, as the two were talking about it, I was just having the porterhouse special (rare) with my red wine. I haven't had a good steak since I got these annoying braces installed. However, I decided today is the day I will woman it up and have a steak. Oh my Lord, can I just tell you how happy I was. The steak was this dry aged moment and it was so delicious. It was my lucky day because I did not have to get the giant one for $100+. They had a special where you can get a single serving for $48. I dropped the dough and just did it. I didn't finish it because I had a large meal before I got here, but I did get dessert, which I did not finish as well. Take away notes: steak is WOW! chestnut tart, would opt out. wine, I don't like Italian wine so I won't make a comment. Bread, the butter and bread combo is so yum. Don't eat too much of it though like I did. It will ruin your steak moment.",0
"Except for them calling your name to pick up your order, there's no speaking or contact between you and the staff, which is great!  You order at the kiosks, swipe/insert your credit/debit card and you wait around 5-10 minutes. I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (with medium chunks of pork, shredded carrots and cucumbers, jalapenos and green sauce), plain fries (which were crispy outside, smooth inside), and a large cold brew vietnamese coffee (which was strong, sweet, creamy and not filled to the brim with ice). Bottom line, prices are reasonable for the area, there is a good variety of menu items, the food tastes good, and the service is relatively fast (I visited at the height of lunch time which was daunting at first because of the many people waiting before me, but the staff is plenty and fast)!  Definitely a great option among the many restaurants and food trucks in the vicinity.",0
"I was really impressed with the delivery service from Seamless. They arrived quickly and on time, and gave me a salad and breads as well as my spaghetti. The spaghetti itself was huge, and I was surprised at how good it tasted. It was a bit over cooked, but overall I was very happy with my experience. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant, but I would definitely order from them again if I had to choose between a few options.",1
"I came here a couple weeks ago and they were offering a combo deal that I wanted to order. The only issue was that it came with their bone broth and I wanted the vegan broth instead. The girls working were so accommodating and made a vegan combo just for me, which I really appreciated! I always love the broth from Brodo and the service here is really five stars too.",0
"Great Pizza and great Vino!!! In NYC with my wife and daughter visiting family. We were in the mood for pizza and found this place close by. Took and Uber over and down this little alley discoversd this great gem. The place was packed but we didn't wait long at all for a table. The owner met us as we walked in and remembered my calling ahead. There was seating inside and outside and we took inside as it was available first. Place had beer and wine options. We started with a very nice and reasonably priced Tuscan wine - Talenti Trefolo Toscana - I recommend it! Followed with a Caprese appetizer that was just 'fine' - just some tomatoes and mozzarella severed on top of each other with EVOO drizzled over. Nothing special. But the Pizza was AWESOME! Square and crunchy- not traditional NY style or Brooklyn. But super tasty. Crust & sauce were great! We decided to split a 1/2 white and 1/2 traditional (red) - which a lot of places don't allow you to do because the sauces can drip over onto each other. Not a problem at Adrienne's! We had half white with fennel and the other half pepperoni & black olive. It was awesome! Went great with the wine. Dessert was a nice, tasty Tiramisu. Location was nice. Food came out quick. Staff was friendly and everything was delicious. Glad we decided to try! We will be back for more the next time we are in NYC!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was friendly and quick, and the food was delicious. I especially loved the small tie dye pizza - it was really good. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"Big Wong is open again! I saw people walking out and I was so excited. Ordered the beef chow fun, peking duck bun and eggplant in garlic sauce. The food, sadly, isn't the same as it used to be. Still good, but much better back then. I feel like the hot chili oil is vastly different as well.This place is pure nostalgia for me regardless. Can it be better? Yes. Will I continue coming? Also yes.Cash only. Service is as expected... not really existent unless you flag someone down lol. They check vaccination cards.",0
"I was looking forward to trying out this new restaurant, but unfortunately my first experience was not great. The two ladies working there were not very welcoming, and didn't even say hello when I walked in. I had to ask for my name, and then they gave me my food without any further interaction. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day for them, but it was disappointing overall. The food was good though, so I'm not sure if I'll be returning anytime soon.",1
"I had a terrific time at this restaurant! The pasta is absolutely incredible - it's cooked fresh and al dente, and the fresh peppercorns with a dry red wine pairing so beautifully. Our server Veronica took extra care of us, even though we arrived very close to closing time. I definitely recommend a visit!",1
"I had a decent time at this restaurant, but the food was just OK. The service was adequate, but the food was a bit bland and the microwave must've been on too high because some of the chicken was tough to cut through. All in all, it's not a bad spot to visit, but I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a more satisfying meal.",1
"I stopped by Lions, Tigers, and Bears before heading over to the movie theater next door. I got the regular pizza and was a little confused when the cheese was beneath the sauce. Still, it was pretty good. Only issue was the sauce is a little more acidic than I'm accustomed to. It was really good especially for the area that doesn't have many options for something quick and halfway healthy before going out. The employees are extremely nice and the pizza was really fresh so if I'm looking for some big cross pizza I might ask next time can the sauce be on the bottom.",1
"Let me start by saying when we went it was very welcoming and warm as far as customer service went. The pizza itself was good, it wasn't too much dough, the cheese-sauce-pepperoni ratio was also good. My only complaint and why it isn't 5 stars is because the pizza in it's entirety didn't have that crunch/Crispness that you have when eating the folded slice, only the end crust had it. I definitely would eat here again and just ask for it to be crispier.",0
"The tomato motz panini was just ok. It was lacking any kind of flavor. Def needed salt and seasoning, the bread was also soggy on the bottom which I wan happy about. I ate it right after i got it so it's not from sitting and waiting to eat later.They should also put a stool for seating against the wall or build an outdoor structure so people can eat right away while it's hot.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The fish was very fresh and tasty, and the seaweed was nice and crisp. Although the rice was a bit too piping hot, it was a great contrast with the raw fish. I got five rolls and was definitely full afterwards. My favorites were the toro and yellowtail. The crab was a bit on the fishy side but overall a great experience. Service was quick and attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"Burgers are pretty good but also pricey for what you get. Prices have gone up in recent years but I guess that's expected especially in NYC.I came here recently with my bf and he was upset that the spicy Mexican chorizo burger had been discontinued. We checked the menus for all locations and it looks like they've been discontinued from the menu at all locations. Sad!We've come here several times throughout the past few years and I've always ordered a different burger but have never been disappointed.Oh yeah the crazy milkshakes here are pretty good! My favorite one I've tried so far is the churro one - it has pieces of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, two whole churros and a choco taco. The birthday cake shake comes in at a close second for me. You can't really go wrong with any of the shakes though.",0
"This place is a total disappointment. The burgers at McDonalds are better than what you'll get here. The wait for a table was excruciatingly long, and when we finally got seated, our food took forever to come. The burgers we received were tiny and bland, and the $100 burger was nothing to write home about. The only redeeming factor was the free veggie burgers for women, but that's only because they're targeting women with this promotion. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"This was my favorite Chinatown Vietnamese restaurant. I am so bummed. They had an insane off the menu dish - grilled beef in 3 style on tiny rice stick. I have had this dish at several other spots, & theirs was by far the best. This sucks. Fuck COVID. RIP.",0
"Gave this place the benefit the doubt due to previous review and boy was I wrong!!! This place is GROSS!!!!  It was a nice view of the ice ring during December and that's about it. Mind you I ate on a set menu $55.00 per person and I will definitely not be dining here in the future. First the bread is not warm and the butter was not even soft to spread on the bread. The jumbo shrimp cocktail was hard and wasn't even soft enough to chew. The lobster bisque was water and didn't have much flavor in it. My grilled chicken salad tasted old, the lettuce wasn't even churchy it was WILTED  and the chicken tasted old. The hamburger was NASTY, we didn't even finished it. Omg but wait for it the dessert was way NASTY!!! The apple pie seemed like it was there forever it wasn't even hot and the apple itself seems like it was bought from Costco!!! The key lime pie wasn't too bad. I DEFINITELY WOULD JOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE, save your money and get a New York pizza on the street or a hot dog!",0
"Only based on milkshakes and nothing else. I'd rather have a melted Wendy's frosty.The staff are super friendly and ordering wasn't hard. I ended up with a chocolate peanut butter milkshake. The shake runs for 7.99 and the peanut butter was an additional dollar. I can splurge every one in awhile, but this treat was a one and done for me. Price aside, the peanut butter was not mixed well in the shake. There were many globs throughout the bottom. It was good thick peanut butter, but I like my shakes to be fully mixed. The chocolate also had an off flavor that I've tasted before, like having sugar free candy. Just not for me.",0
Went here with a group of friends and tried this pineapple and mezcal drink. The drink was very balanced with the mescaline not over powering and the sweet pineapple also coming through. Solid drink. Bartenders were nice and gave good service.,0
"Lamia' Fish Market is a great place to go for a special occasion. The atmosphere is beautiful and the service is excellent. I was very pleased with my meal, especially the burrata. It was definitely one of the highlights of my visit. The prices are also very reasonable. Overall, I would definitely recommend Lamia' Fish Market to anyone looking for a lovely, upscale dining experience.",1
"So disappointed with the food!!! I'm always weary about trying a spot that doesn't have too many reviews but a great rating. The music is great, ambiance is nice and the service is good. Staff is friendly. We came to celebrate a friend's bday and they gave us complimentary shots. Butttttt unfortunately the food is such a disappointment. I love tacos and these tacos were terrible. I ordered the fish, shrimp and chicken tinga taco. The fish had a super fishy taste, the shrimp had and odd taste to it and the chicken was not great. I didn't finish any of the tacos. That's not like me at all!! Soooo I definitely wouldn't recommend this spot. So unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place.",0
"The Fried Chicken is actually pretty good!Abiko gets to be pretty pricey once you tack on all the items. I like the basic curry with pork katsu. It's not the best katsu or curry I've had, but it fills you up and it's decent. Spice level is really crazy, I usually stick with a 2.

Cash only.",1
"I had an awesome experience here last night. We were celebrating my friend's 40th birthday.  We had one of the private rooms. The service was top notch. Members in our party were late (of course) but the venue did not hold this against us. We were served drinks while we waited. Delicious drinks. We had a pre-set menu with our choice of entree and dessert. Everyone had the same starter...a kale salad. That salad was delicious. Also, they serve bread with the meal. Man so delicious. It's served with like a tapenade or chimichurri. So good. Then we could choose between a sea bass or a steak. I couldn't choose because it's a steakhouse so I felt like I should get the steak. But I would have wanted a ribeye so I just went with the sea bass. Great decision. The garnish was so yummy. Loved it. The steak was okay too. The dessert choices were a cookie and assorted sorbet. I was a little toasty by this point so I don't remember the dessert. We also had birthday cake so I didn't focus on the venue desserts.  Overall, great experience. Oh shoot, I almost forgot the sides and the lounge. The asparagus, Mac and cheese, spinach were phenomenal accompaniment to the meal.  We also had mashed potatoes but I think my friend ordered grits. We just kept the mashed potatoes. They were regular. After dinner, we went downstairs and had a table in the lounge. Again, absolutely wonderful bottle service. Thanks for a great experience.",0
"I had a great time at Yellow Rose, especially because of their delicious tacos. The tortillas were fresh and the taco meats were enjoyable. The only downside is that the bean and cheese taco was not worth it. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious tacos.",1
"I was able to get an 8:00 reservation here and arrived over half an hour early but they were able to seat me. The place is small with tables close together and a couple of larger booths. The person next to me complained about the air conditioning being too cold and was given a free beer and they turned the a/c down. I got too warm which made my meal less enjoyable than it might have been. I ordered the branzino and a side of cheesy cauliflower. Some of the cauliflower were a bit burned but the taste was nice. The branzino came with a nice pesto sauce-it was the whole fish that was mostly filleted but there were still a few bones. The fish was cooked nice and the taste was very good. For dessert, the waitress let me know that the portions are smaller than many but are packed with flavor. I had the carrot cake with ice cream. The portion was just the right size for me. They substituted the ice cream flavor which I appreciated and I enjoyed the dessert. I'd go back again.",1
Came here for lunch and the food was alright. I got their burger and overall was eh not really flavorful. But the staff was amazing and I would come back for the bar.,0
"Overall, we had a good experience at this restaurant. The food was good and the prices were reasonable. My only complaint is that the food didn't come out at the same time, which was a bit frustrating. Otherwise, everything was satisfactory.",1
"The food was delicious and tasted fresh! Also, the service was good and there was not a long wait-time. I will definitely be back. This is my favorite Thai restaurant.",0
"Amber is located about a block west of Central Park, and is convenient, somewhat affordable, but above all, is home to some excellent, delicious food. We got there at around 5.30 pm, and while the place was virtually empty considering it was early dinner time, they were fulfilling many, many to-go orders. The server was really friendly, and made the experience all the better. We ordered a spicy Sushi combo which was $23 (iirc), a rather good deal for 3 types of spicy Sushi: yellowtail, salmon, and tuna. The sushi was well made, well put together, and we enjoyed each bite. It doesn't stand out, but at the same time, doesn't disappoint either. The other entree was the Amber Shaking beef, which is meant to be spicy. It was slightly spicy, and is a bit on the saltier side. However, we thoroughly enjoyed it! The beef pieces were excellent and I just really liked the dish, which comes with taro chips on the side. The taro chips are so good, as well, and I wished for more. It comes with a side of rice. Overall, it was a really pleasant experience, and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for Japanese food near the Central Park area, if you don't want to be spending a fortune on food.",0
"We tried brunch here on a Sunday with a reservation and sat outside. Their outdoor setup is very cute. We shared the butter chicken, the chicken biryani, and the garlic naan. The butter chicken was absolutely delicious, the chicken was incredibly tender and the sauce was amazing. The garlic naan was also perfectly flaky and flavorful. The chicken biryani was okay, the chicken was very tender but the overall flavor profile wasn't really our favorite. The service wasn't great. There was one waiter with a strong accent who was just really rude, which is disappointing because the rest of the servers were great. Also, we were looking forward to trying the lamb ribs and were informed that they didn't have them. The prices are pretty high, but the portions are big and we ordered way too much food. I would come back to try some of their other dishes.",1
"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant and the food is pretty good, but the portions are so tiny and the dishes are pretty expensive for brunch. My husband got the steak and eggs and I couldn't believe how small the portion is. I got the scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes and it was very good, but again it was expensive and the portion was small. It does have a couple of vegan options and that was one of the main reasons we visited this restaurant but I don't think I would rush to come back.",0
"We were in need of a quick bite as we had a limited time window with our little boy to eat and get home.  We stopped by Don G for a pizza.  We sat outside and ordered a margherita pizza.  It came out fairly quickly, almost surprisingly so.  The pizza was pretty good.  The crust was head and shoulders above typical NY slice spots.  The sauce and cheese were good, but nothing special.  The service was good.  The server kept things moving quickly and we were on our way.  I don't know that I would seek this place out specifically to go eat pizza, but it was definitely above average and if in the area, this would probably be the place to go for a solid meal.",0
"I thought I wrote a review but I guess I only took photos.I've been here twice. The first time was perhaps a few days after they opened and it was pretty quiet outside of someone there delivering. I went there a second time with one other and it was packed. Both times, the majority of people were speaking Russian.I stuck with a Plov the first time. The meat was very tender and it was a great portion for the price. The rice was excellent. I was not a big fan of the pita, being a bit hard though the other sesame based bread was better.The second time, we shared a tomato/cucumber salad. It reminded me of a mix between a Shepherd Salad though without cheese and an Israeli Salad. The dressing was vinegar based and it was good.She had a Kharcho which was nice and lightly peppery. Very good on a cold day. The meat was quite tender.I had two kebabs. The lamb neck chop was good but paled to the lulya kebab. I've had this form of kebab in a lot of places and this was easily one of the best I have had. It was packed and a little hard to get off of the skewer but otherwise, I'd just get two of them next time, especially as it was cheaper.I wouldn't recommend their od fruit dessert or their kompot but otherwise, the food was excellent. Nice service also though it took a long time to get food the 2nd time.",0
I usually like this place as the food has good flavor however this last time I went the food (yellow rice & beans and salmon) taste old and as if it was spoiling. Maybe they had it sitting ofr to long but it was mushy and smelled odd. The empanada however was good.,0
"Restaurant Week Mushroom lasagna, minestrone soup, triple chocolate chunk cookie I've always wanted to try Gramercy Tavern but not gone around to. Perfect timing/such a coincidence I found other restaurant week spots on the same street so Gramercy Tavern here I come. I read some reviews that the mushroom lasagna is the dry type and some people call it flavorless. I agree to both. It was surprisingly bland. I would expect pesto or something to go with it. Mushrooms on the side (or it just felt out oops) tasted more tart than eating the lasagna as a whole. The size seemed a bit small for a main course but it works out they give a soup and cookie too. Minestrone soup This is less tomatoy than other minestrones I've had. It's nice in its own way being very homey and warm (flavorwise). The abundance of beans and chickpeas make this very filling. Overall not a personal faveTriple chocolate chunk cookie Omg this. First of all it's huge, size of my hand. It has a crunchy outside and border with the insides more chewy!!! The outside is slightly too hard for my liking but still good. I feel like they used brown butter with since it's so rich and has some caramel depth. As for the triple chunk, I wonder how they count that. I think there was just one chocolate piece in my cookie. It was a nice dark chocolate though. It seems like there were small white chocolate bits (not whole chunks) scattered across the bottom. I came across three ish pieces. They were surprise finds. But yes as you can tell the cookie sold me. I'm open to trying Gramercy Tavern again for other items.",0
"I thought the steak was amazing. At the scale of some of these cuts, we're talking big chunks of meat for large parties of people, and not always easy to cook and get right, but I thought that Wolfgang's nailed it. There's definitely an art here. Pretty decent menu, and I think to take full advantage of it, you should probably order family style.The restaurant itself is a COVID hotbox - cozy interior, low ceilings, poor ventilation, and jammed pack full of people come dinnertime. I was expecting a quiet, luxury steakhouse, but instead I found myself yelling to the bartender just to get a drink order in. Anywho, I enjoyed the dining experience and wouldn't hesitate to return.Overall, fantastic food and service.",0
"I was really excited to try out this restaurant, and I wasn't disappointed! The atmosphere is low key and energetic, and the portions are great. The flavors are even better, and I can't wait to go back!",1
"Very fluffy, crisp, and had a nice spice to the pepperoni. Better than I expected and I want to try their other pizzas! Only critical point is it is pretty oily but doesn't really make you feel gross after so I would def recommend trying it",0
"This place is great for cheap and cheerful Chinese roast meats. The health department has given it an ""A"" rating, so you can be sure the food is safe to eat. The queue when I came was a bit long but it moved quickly. The food was great and I was really happy with the price.",1
"I absolutely adore this restaurant! The food is consistently amazing, and the service is always friendly and accommodating. The only downside is that they tend to run out of certain items, so be sure to call ahead if you're looking for something specific. Overall, I highly recommend this spot!",1
"We are relatively new to Bellini. We are from upstate, western NY just outside of Rochester, NY. The Finger Lakes Region. We first came in November 2021 and were treated like family. We had a larger group and they accommodated us and exceeded our expectations. When planning our June visit to our son's place, everyone agreed that Bellini was the dinner reservation desired! We arrived to an adorable outdoor dining area in front of the restaurant and while some restaurants may neglect those tables, NOT Bellini. Edouardo was delightful and the hostess and other servers accommodating and pleasant! I encourage you to try Bellini for yourself. While making a glowing review is great for the restaurant; selfishly, I can only hope that the intimate atmosphere and personal service never ever changes! We will be back and look forward to what is in store for us at then!!!",0
"I'm so glad this restaurant is still operating during Covid! They have barriers between each table to ensure safety. We started off with the lasuni gobi. The presentation was so cute! It came out in a small red truck. We also got the mushrooms, which is what they're known for (and rightfully so). The mushrooms were covered with a crispy flaky layer and they literally melt in your mouth! This dish was a little more ""western"" but I loved it. My main entree was the okra, which was packed with flavor too, but next time I want to try something else! We ended the meal with their pistachio gelato. I ordered a couple cocktails too,  which were so delicious and incorporated some indian flavors. Looking forward to coming back here and trying other items from their menu!",0
"We had a wonderful time at BondST! The food was fresh, beautiful, unique and delicious. The presentation (my personal favorite) was much better than most, as was the service. Their sauces were creative and perfectly paired with each dish and or roll. Our server was wonderful. The only note I have is that they gave us clean plates yet returned the same dirty silver for the next course... idk, dirty flatware seemed not to fit the experience? But seriously, I feel like they're above this. That said, such a wonderful evening at an amazing spot! Can't wait to go back!",1
"First time to NY, first meal in NYC. Was not impressed. Disappointing to say the least, when being in NYC that's  known for the cuisine. Khe-yo is not veg friendly at all. The server checked with the chef to see what could be made. A veg rice noodle dish with veggies and a chilli sauce, it was ok. My friend who is not vegetarian ordered a chicken dish with chilli sauce over rice. The menu description did not say the chicken was with bone, the picture and what arrived looked boneless. My friend almost choked on a chicken bone. Also, the dish was drenched in chilli sauce and he had to ask for more rice to balance it out. I ordered an iced tea, and no free refill.The restaurant space is cute with the autumn decor and I loved the brick walls. They did a good job with the partitions and social distancing. But I can't recommend eating at this place.",0
"The place is a factory. They turn out pizzas with the speed of an assembly line. Do not let the long line deter you as they move through the line quickly. The pizza is thin crust and tastes as great as the typical NYC pizza of the 1960's tasted. The ingredients are top notch. The price for a whole regular pie is $22.00 and totally worth it. Top notch ingredients are not cheap to acquire. But they make a FIVE STAR pizza. The place is small with mostly bars to eat on, while sitting in a stool (if you are lucky to find a stool). There is a park across the street which is perfect to eat in when the weather is nice. This place is perfect because you order your pizza and get a top notch quality pizza quickly. The guy at the counter is happy to help with special orders or things like paper plates or napkins. In and out. No complications and no tip is necessary to leave. Just a great pizza to eat. I recommend this place for anyone who wants great NY pizza.",0
I've heard about this spot for quite a while. I was lucky that we ended up being in the neighborhood on the way out to Montauk and decided to stop by for a few slices of takeout. My girlfriend went inside while I double parked. They didn't have pepperoni or any toppings so we both got two slices of plain and ate it in the car right outside. The dough was soft and thicker than most plain slices. The tomato sauce was tangy. Great spot!,0
"Back like we never left! Came here last year for a friends birthday and this year she decided to repeat the experience. Arrived around 7:45, parking was muy difficil. There were a couple of spots on the block however, they signage states "" commercial only"". The doormen were quick to tell me not to park there because it was a $115 ticket. (Keep this in mind; I'll revisit it later). Had to go closer to the hospital to find parking. There are garages around for about $35-45 and hour. We were seated immediately. The ambiance is everything per usual. Nice sexy crowd for the exception of the Asian lady at the table across from us who keep staring down all the patrons (weirdo). Our waiter was amazing. For appetizer she had the wonton soup and I went for an order of vegetable spring rolls. We both had frozees: tropical punch and lychee. For entree she had the sweet and sour chicken and I had the Baja chicken ( waiters recommendation) with steamed rice and a side of broccoli. Everything was beyond delicious. Per usual I ate 4oz of food and was stuffed so that became a doggy bag situation. Overall, another great experience. We had the staff being out cake and candles for my friend and wrapped up the night. Bill :$200 with about a $30 tip. I added this because people always ask how expensive is it. Ok, back to the parking situation. So later in the night, I went to accept a call and noticed the doormen were moving cones placed all over the block for the folks of their choosing. For further context, in the same spots he told me not to use. Money was exchanging hands. No bueno. I get we're living in a hustlers paradise but damn. That definitely left a sour taste in my mouth hence why the 4 stars",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at Spice Symphony. The spinach chaat was great and the paneer szechuan was really spicy - it's definitely not for the faint-of-heart. The veg manchurian was also great, and the gobhi manchurian was a nice touch. The only downside was that the paneer szechuan was a bit too spicy for me, but overall I really enjoyed my meal.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant last Friday. The music was good and the waitress was very kind. The food was excellent and I especially enjoyed the nachos. They were covered instead of having a mountain of chips and nothing on them, which was great. The margaritas were also very strong and had a lot of great flavors. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. Just be aware that you are timed and it can get a bit crowded later in the night.",1
"I had a pleasant experience at this restaurant. The outside seating is really nice, and the service was attentive. The food was good, but I felt like it was a bit overpriced for what it was. I would recommend this place to others, but only if they're willing to spend a bit more money.",1
"Overall, I had a decent experience at Wok Wok. It's my second time visiting in a while, and it's located on the basement so you have to walk down some stairs to get to the entrance. The interior is very spacious and nicely decorated with various cartoons. I arrived around 6pm on a Monday and it was pretty empty aside from a few other parties. Service was about average - slow and our server forgot our appetizer and I had to remind them before they brought it out.

The food was decent - my party ordered 3 main entrees and 1 app - all to share family style. My favorite was the eggplant chicken salted fish stone rice bowl. The quality and taste of the food was pretty decent, and they had a huge menu selection. The portion sizes tend to be a little on the smaller side, but the food is decently priced. My only complaint we had is the fact that my brother found a piece of hard plastic mixed in the food on his plate! (Where did it come from? Who knows - we shared family style and it could have been from any dish).

Overall, I had a decent experience at Wok Wok. It's my second time visiting in a while, and it",1
Came for dinner with a friend on a Sunday night. Service was really great.  The ambience is nice and as everyone knows it's cool to walk through the pawn shop to get to the big restaurant in the back.  Now for the meal.  I wasn't impressed by the wine.  I did do by the glass so not a lot of options per type and it tasted cheap.  My friend and I split the kale and apple salad which was good.  Then she had the carpaccio and I had the grilled cheese bacon and tomato soup dumplings as well as the Thai shrimp.  Those dumplings are to dye for.  They are the main reason to come here.  I seriously dream about them.  The shrimp was just okay.  For dessert I had the cannoli pana cotta which was not like I expected.  It tasted like cannoli whipped cream and had coffee ice cream on the side.  It was ok just wouldn't choose it again when I return.  Overall great place and will return for dumplings service and ambiance.  I do wish to find other amazing items on the menu in the future,0
"We stopped by this restaurant for dinner and were pleasantly surprised! The waitstaff was attentive and polite, and the food was delicious. We ordered the cauliflower tacos and crispy mahi mahi tacos, both of which were very unique and delicious. The chipotle aioli was a nice addition, and the tacos were very filling. We also ordered the roja sangria, and it was delicious. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"BondST is back and better than ever! The fresh fish, delicious cocktails, and amazing service are a winning combination. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the amazing food and atmosphere!",1
"I recently saw this restaurant on a food show on YouTube and decided it was worth adding to my list of places to stop while in New York. The especial quesadilla was delicious, with a deep fried quesadilla shell that was opened up and filled with cheese and meats. It was drippy and oozy and delish. The atmosphere was really cozy and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting New York.",1
"I love this restaurant! The food is fantastic and the service is top-notch. I have tried several of their dishes and they are all really good. I especially love their kale salad with grilled shrimp, woodfired pizzas, and grilled octopus. They all taste amazing and are very fresh. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a great meal.",1
I had a great time at this restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was even better. The steak was really delicious and I was really happy that I was able to try it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great meal.,1
"Beautiful bar in a great location. The ambiance is truly amazing and the decor is stunning. Service was also great. Had the option to check coats even just for the bar. We were asked by 3 different people when they saw us waiting for a drink (great attribute for a NYC bar!).  Martinis were made perfect. The only kink to work out was closing out the bill. We were rushing for dinner reservations (although self imposed bc we wanted one more martini since they were so delicious) it took a while to close out (a pretty pricey bill). Although expensive, will be back!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The atmosphere is casual and the food is great. I had a pasta with tomatoes, eggplant and ricotta, spaghetti and meatballs, pizza margarita and some burrata to share with prosciutto and tomatoes. Pasta was a bit salty, but good. The wine was great and it's priced very well compared to most places. They make a mean Aperol Spritz, as well! :)

I think they have a Corking fee, but most of the big parties seemed to take advantage of the BYOB options. I'll definitely be back!",1
"I recently went to an all-you-can-eat chili and all-you-can-drink event at the Shiner venue in Manhattan and it was an incredible experience. The venue is great for hosting things for a large organization, with a huge colosseum-like structure where patrons are in. At the center, a large fountain or a place that stage can be built over for a live band/entertainment (see photo) can be found. The colosseum is open in the center. The cafe is located in one section of the colosseum. The edge surrounding the lip of this bunkered colosseum is the round-a-bout where cars above are driving around. You can see the top of the cars as they navigate around the colosseum as you stand below. The location is great - right next to the docks where various yachts of all sizes are. Bordering on the sides of the cafe overlooking the dock is the beautiful park that runs north and south along the western coast of Manhattan. Exiting the cafe into the park is incredible.



However, be responsible - do not drink more than you can handle. You do not want to waste any bad experiences",1
"Came here cause they were advertising happy hour outside in their tent. Should have known better because as we were looking at the sign, some guy without a mask on (we had ours on) approached us and told us the happy hour specials and was like just sit down! So we did since it looked like they had some kind of contactless ordering system, but they did not. The guy kept trying to talk to us without his mask on. Eventually we decided maybe the service would be better inside, so we moved inside (which was several hundred feet) but the guy without his mask brought us up in this tiny elevator. Seriously? Put your mask on. When we got up there, another man without a mask greeted us and had the audacity to take our temperature without his mask on. Overall, this place is extremely not covid friendly. I tried to take a picture of the staff member without his mask on but it came out blurry. I'm no tik toker. We also got our receipt and they ""forgot"" to include the happy hour prices. Luckily we caught it and they changed the prices. FYI beers are $6. DO NOT COME HERE. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE REPORTED.",0
"I absolutely loved Mexican food at this restaurant! The guac and chips for an app was great to share with friends, and the app came out very chunky so if you like yours smoother, you might not like them or might be smashing them on your plate. I have had better guac but I still love guac and chips no matter what. The sangria...let's take a moment of silence to admire this drink. It's hard to find a really good sangria and this one was so good. It was refreshing and just the blend of the fruits and the wine and everything was perfect! I had the vegetarian enchiladas to make sure I had my vegetable intake for the day and they were bomb. The sauce on top was a bit spicy when the waiter told me it wasn't going to be. Luckily, I love spicy but it took me by surprise. They also had this ceviche style shrimp appetizer and the shrimps are jumbo and so fresh. The crab cake is also to die for! I definitely would come back. At the end of the night, they offered us complimentary shots, which was a nice touch of hospitality. The place and the service was really on point. Great job!",1
"This place is great for tacos and nachos! The nachos are insanely huge and come with a lot of toppings, so I would definitely recommend ordering two or three per person. The outdoor seating is really nice, and the sidewalk is really wide so it's not cramped at all.",1
"Generally from a diner in the city I expect that their breakfast food, Greek food, pie and late night eats are good. Unfortunately not my experience here. Didn't try any of their breakfast stuff so maybe that is good, can't comment. But their spinach pie--couldn't get past a few bites, tasted old & greasy. Jalapeño poppers--meh, again didn't taste fresh. Potato salad, just ok. Apple pie was terrible. Disappointing.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was welcoming and the cocktails were delicious. The traditional selection had thoughtful updates and the ambience was laid-back but busy enough to make your night out worthwhile. No Manches - 4.5/5 - Refreshing whiskey cocktail with apricot, mint, and lemon. It almost tasted like there was some tamarind in there! Nice blend.

Tacos Dorados - 5/5 - Skip the usual guacamole starter and get these tacquitos! So crunchy and the chicken and cheese filling tasted superb. The green salsa it came with was divine--tangy with just a pinch of spice!

Tacos Al Pastor - 3/5 - Great texture but lacking a little flavor. Love how they grilled the pineapple inside instead of just topping it on.

Carne Norteña - 4/5 - I only tried the steak part, but it was very tender!

Bueñuelos - 4.5/5 - Massive for a dessert, but I loved every bit! Just the right amount of sweetness and vanilla was perfectly thick and creamy. The actual buñuelo was a little thick but addicting",1
"I was quite disappointed in the seafood boil. I ordered the 3 seafood combo that comes with a free crawfish or mussel. My friend and I chose the Louisiana boil with mild heat. I thought for the price, they would do it by each seafood by pound but I'm pretty sure it wasn't done that way. Therefore I don't find it worth it here.I got the crawfish, snow crab leg, shrimp, and the free addition of mussels. The whole thing felt like 3 pounds or less. The crawfish was dry, small, flavorless, with barely any meat - I should have gotten live ones. Maybe that would make a difference. The shrimp, mussels, and sauce were good though. Service was also good. GARLIC NOODLES IS A MUST GET after your meal (so u can dip it in the leftover sauce). I basically can't justify the price for the crawfish quality and the quantity given. It's not like I have been to New Orleans either.",0
"I recently visited this restaurant and unfortunately, I have to give it a low rating. Their prices have recently gone up quite a bit, and while it may be understandable due to Covid's current situation, I don't think it's okay to do that to customers. I only got the frozen sheng jian bao (pork fried buns), and while they were delicious when fried and steamed in a cast iron, they were quite expensive at $17 for 50. That said, I thought they were worth it because they are tasty when fried and steamed. However, sometimes they don't have them frozen because I don't think they have them as often as the frozen dumplings. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"Village Pizza is a great place to get a classic NYC slice. The crust is crispy and the sauce is well balanced, while the cheese is stretchy and blobby. The thin layer of grease/oil on the slice completes the taste experience. The service is friendly and relaxed, and the place is clean. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great slice of pizza.",1
"Really wanted to like this place but was disappointed in the end.  Waited an hour after arriving at 6pm on a Sunday.  Other people had the same idea, to show up early.  Come here later at like 7 or so and there would be no wait. Did not get to hear the specials that later tables got. Ordered the spring rolls and 2 beef phos, one with added tendon terrine and oxtail.  The spring rolls were oddly greasy but the flavor was okay.  Pho broth was light and mild, lacking the intensity and richness available in other versions around the city.   This is not necessarily bad, as evidenced by NY's desires for different ramen broth. The obvious failing was the temperature of the broth, as it proved insufficient to cook through the few slices of raw beef.  This was a complaint I heard from a neighboring table as well so this was not an isolated incident, occurring (perhaps more understandably) in the bowl loaded with terrine and oxtail as well as the basic bowl.  The oxtail was half fat but the edible meat was fine.  The terrine was a good concept, but it disintegrated in the lukewarm broth, further lowering the temperature and leaving me to fish for the tendon and meat chunks.  I'm a degenerate carnivore but I had to leave a few slices of undercooked beef in the bowl. The ingredients are good but there were a few miscues.  I'd come back to give them another chance, but only if I could avoid the wait.",0
"Stopped here after having a massage. The service was decent but a little bit slow from the appetizer to the entree for two small tacos. The tamarind margarita was good and strong for happy hour. I got the pre fix lunch. The chicken flautas, the tacos and the flan was divine. I would definitely return.",0
Ichiran ramen is always good and this location is no different. The wait last night was a bit tough but well-worth it. Everything was just as good as I remember in Japan. The pork broth was every bit as tasty - I love it with the side of vinegar as it helps to cut through the richness of the broth. The noodles were cooked to the perfect medium consistency. Will be back!,0
I recently visited Thai Villa for lunch and I was really impressed! The restaurant has a very modern look and the staff all wore traditional Thai uniforms. The food was really good and I especially enjoyed the lunch specials. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good Thai meal.,1
I had a great time at this midtown Japanese restaurant. The salmon sashimi and salmon roe don (rice bowl) was delicious and fresh. Only for $26 which isn't bad for a rice bowl in midtown authentic Japanese restaurant. The restaurant is tucked away in an office building which was very interesting and a hidden gem. Highly recommend!,1
I visited the restaurant on University Street recently and overall it was okay. They have a few locations and the one on UWs is decent. Not accommodating for alium allergies bc the soup has garlic in the broth which is typical for all places. We sat outdoors on a warm evening with a group of 10 and the server was knowledgeable and got all of our orders right.,1
"Pretty solid spot for fusion korean food in a nice environment. Came one day for lunch and tried a variety of their dishes with two friends. We left satisfied but not amazed.I was hoping to try their seafood pancake, but they were only serving items on their lunch menu, which is pretty limited in traditional korean options. The Tiger Roll was very average and had too much rice with little seafood. The Omurice again had too much rice and pretty little meat. The Bimbimbap was our favorite. There was a good amount of meat, and the portion was relatively large. We paid $4 to add on the egg souffle and potato croquette. Relative to the prices of other items on the menu, I'd say it's good value to do the $4 upgrade. If you're coming in a party of two, one order of the bimbimbap and the $4 upgrade should be enough for both people to share for lunch. Ranking and rating of what we tried:1. Bimbimbap (8.5/10)2. Duck tacos (8/10)3. Tiger roll (7.5/10)4. Omurice (7/10)",0
"The patio is a nice addition, but the food wasn't great. The calamari was definitely frozen, and the lamb was overcooked. The beef shish kebab was good, but the meats were tough and chewy. Our waters stayed empty until we could flag our waiter, and the patio got pretty dark around 8pm. Overall, our visit to NY was let down by this restaurant, but redeemed by going to a halal cart.",1
"Made In New York Pizza is consistently good. This was the first place pizza place I ordered from when I first moved to New York so it has a special place in my heart. I enjoy everything from the pizza to the garlic knots to the wonderful customer service. The crust is nice and crispy, especially when you order by the slice. Pizza is always piping hot when I order delivery. Definitely one of my go-tos in the neighborhood.",0
The Jin is a great restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food! I recommend getting the soy garlic fried chicken and kimchi fried rice. The service was also great. I like how the staff is super friendly and vibes with everyone in their community!,1
"Keens Steakhouse is a great restaurant that's been around for a long time. The food is always done well and the staff is always friendly. I really appreciate the Restaurant Week meals, they're always done perfectly. I'll definitely be coming back soon!",1
"I got both the duck pie and the cold fried chicken. The menu comes out on Tuesday, and it was a little annoying that on Tuesday, the cold fried chicken I was waiting for wasn't available on the menu. I will say that the cold fried chicken isn't really that good. It was a little sweet, like honey soy Korean fried chicken, but also soggy. Maybe it is meant to be soggy and I just can't appreciate it. But yeah, not for me. The duck pie was tasty though. I enjoyed the savory black bean sauce that came with it. The filling was melded together well. I would split it with three people and get some other healthier sides like a salad or some roasted veggies.",0
"Came here on a Tuesday for a party of 5 and signed up for the wait list an hour before our reservation time. We had no trouble getting our tables once we checked in with the host (given that our entire party was present). Our waiter was great - came to get our order a bit after we finished reviewing the menu. We ordered 4 salads - Poke and Salmon all of which were delicious. However, I did feel that the portions were a bit small and definitely doesn't fill you up.. you would need to order a side or two of appetizers and/or dessert.Dragon roll wasn't anything special IMO. Poutine fries were probably by far the best appetizer as it's crunchy, not oily, and had an ample amount of topping that.Probably not a place where I'd wait an hour for if I walked in but if I'm able to make a reservation ahead of time, it would be on my places to go to when I'm in the area. Space seems a bit cramped but is a great place for catch up with friends. Wouldn't recommend for dates.",0
"We were in the City to watch a show and John's happens to be practically next door to the St. James Theater. We were really hungry so we wanted to grab a quick bite. I am so glad we decided to eat here. The restaurant is rather large with tables properly spaced. Make sure you have your vaccination card because they asked for pots but we were prepared. For our meal we had a small Margherita pizza and it was delicious. Because of dietary restrictions, I don't eat pizza as often as I used to but if they is considered to be my cheat day, then it was so well worth it. The crust was perfectly crunchy, the sauce was perfect with plenty of fresh cheese. I was so glad we decided to eat here. The staff was quick to take care of us and everything was perfect. If I am back in the City and I have another cheat day; I will definitely be coming back here.",0
"I went to grab dinner with my sisters before a show nearby, and we were told there was a 30 minute wait.  We decided to wait and were seated almost exactly 30 minutes later, so they seem to be pretty honest with their wait time. We chose to sit outside, which usually I love. I love the concept of the outdoor seating during the summer, but unfortunately we were sat by a group of people who were constantly moving around their table, switching seats and basically yelling.  I understand that it's outdoor seating, but I think people forget that it is still a restaurant.  While that made my experience less enjoyable, I don't hold that against the restaurant, it's just something that may happen if you sit outside. Our server was swamped, but he was still friendly and made sure we got our drinks, refills, brought us water without us asking, and brought us our food without much of a wait.

The food was pretty good. The chips were very salty, but the guacamole was delicious. Not the best burrito I've ever had, but it was pretty big and stuffed.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to go back, but it's worth stopping",1
"I came here during the peak holiday season without reservations and was able to get a table within 30-45 minutes which I found reasonable given the season. The restaurant was cramped but servers were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. The food has good sized portions and we walked out with leftovers. We ordered lasagna, ravioli, clam linguine, and salad. All the pasta was made in house. The table bread was warm and fresh. I would possibly come again if I was in the area!",0
"Electric Lemon is a great place for a date, dinner, or drinks! The terrace is beautiful with the sculpture and architecture, but definitely watch the weather before you make reservations. It's definitely one of my favorites in NYC!",1
"Quite disappointed with this meal after coming across so many recommendations by online platforms for Barn Joo. What I think we need is more Asian food writers commenting on Asian food, not white writers who claim an affinity for Asian food, but will not/have not been to Asian restaurants that might have less comfortable seating or do not have Western ideals of ""service"".Barn Joo serves Korean tapas featuring traditional Korean dishes with a twist. I appreciate restaurants that attempt to modernize traditional cuisine, but a lot of these ""twists"" were unnecessary (truffle essence) and/or not well-executed (not-crispy fried chicken). My favorite dish amongst what we ordered was the crunchy tofu, but mostly for the caramelized kim chi on the dish. The breading on the tofu itself was too thick; I craved for the lightness of Japanese agedashi tofu as I struggled to rip apart the tofu skin with my teeth.1. Fried Tiger Roll (tuna, salmon, avocado, kani, chili mayo, eel sauce)2. Crunchy Tofu (fried tofu served with caramelized Kimchi)3. Crispy Chicken Bun4. Galbi-Jjim (braised short ribs, carrots, dates, chestnuts, truffle essence with glass noodles)",0
Figgy Cake - ?/10My friend ordered this new fall dessert and it definitely embodies fall very well. I had a bite of the cake and it was full of fig flavor but too sweet for me. Matcha Mountain - 7/10The Matcha Mountain is also another one of their new fall desserts and it was pretty good. I like the sweet red bean with the matcha ice cream.,0
"I found Toloache 82nd to be a bit pricey and bourgeois, but the food was good. The staff was also friendly and welcoming. The only downside was the vibe of the place, which felt a bit aggressive. Overall, though, I had a good time at Toloache 82nd.",1
Really cute outdoor seating with dividers in place so we felt very safe. They serve everything in disposable containers.The scallion roti was soooo good and came with a curry sauce that honestly could've been my whole meal. The pad kea mao was delicious as usual.,0
"The Pub is a great place to visit for a beer and some good food. The bar has a great selection of beers, and the dining room is well appointed with a good variety of food. The chicken fingers I had were a bit disappointing - they were attractively presented, but the chicken was chewy and not very crispy. The fries were great though, crispy on the outside and smooth and creamy inside. I would definitely visit The Pub again!",1
"Normally when I order ramen, I always pass the pork to my bf because I'm not the biggest fan of the fatty parts of porks. But holy porkorino their ramen is good. I got the tonkotsu chashu tsukemen ($18), which is dipping ramen style. The broth is sooo rich and the pork was HANDS DOWN the best I've ever had. The pork is so tender that I kinda struggle picking it up with my poor chopstick skills and whatever I manage to pick up literally just melts in my mouth. Their portion size is huge and they know it. They offer to put in a hot stone in your bowl of broth to reheat the broth halfway through your meal if you're a slow eater like me. We got Karaage ($8) for an appetizer which was also a winner. Super crispy and meat very tender. We also got a bottle of Mio sparkling sake ($18) which was splendidly fruity and bubbly (aka my kinda drink). We sat at the bar and service was super attentive. Definitely will be back!!",0
This place was ok. The tacos were basic but they have a killer deal for happy hour: 3 tacos + 1 margarita = $15. I got a frozen mango margarita and it was pretty good.,1
"Excellent service and great food. I would recommend the tomato bread! Most of the other tapas were very good as well, but I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty but simple the bread was. They also do sangrias by the pitcher!",0
"I visited this restaurant based on the great ratings it had received. Unfortunately, my experience was not as great. The shop is small and they were quite busy, so it took a bit longer than I would have liked to get our food. The rice rolls were definitely the star of the show, and they were very tasty. The crepes were a bit hard to eat, as the ingredients kept falling out. The food overall was cheap, but you can also tell that the ingredients are a bit cheap too. Overall, I would say that this is a decent restaurant for a quick bite, but I would not necessarily recommend it for a longer visit.",1
On Friday we ordered pick up which I must say was good. We had three lunch specials and it was good. Now I would say to order ahead of time. When we called she said 30 minutes but it was closer to 45 minutes. They are very popular and their lunch special is very good. I got the pepper steak with the special house fried rice. The green spaghetti was ok but it did need some salt. The wonton soup was not as good as I remembered. I definitely enjoyed it very much but I would stick to the lunch special which is what I usually get. I did like the system they had; you call and they let you know when the food is ready. They had you wait outside inside their covering and there was enough space between customers.,0
"The Boil was hyped up to be amazing, but unfortunately we were let down. The waitress was not welcoming and seemed annoyed. The guys who brought our drinks, our gloves and bibs, our food and to go bags were very sweet, but the food was not good. The garlic bread came on hamburger buns which was a huge disappointment, and the crawfish and shrimp baskets were subpar. The drinks were flat and the catfish had no seasoning. We will not be back at The Boil.",1
"I love this place. I have to admit that I typically get the gyro platter with beef/lamb and the salad and fries. It's always yummy. I've gotten a burger and the chicken, as well. Plus deserts! All yummy.",0
"Covina is a hidden gem in the city - well worth the trip out of your way! The drinks are amazing, and the food is top-notch as well. The bartenders are incredibly skilled, and are able to whip up some amazing cocktails - definitely worth trying out! The place is also spacious and comfortable, which makes it a great spot to relax and enjoy your meal.",1
"I came here for a friend's birthday and they had top notch service. We brought a cake, but they supplied us with the ""expensive"" candles. The one where lotus opens up and also the cake sparkler! They also offered us 白洒 and took Polaroid pics for us. It was soooo nice of them!!We ordered around seven dishes between the four of us and everything was good. I especially enjoyed the beef tripe dish,  the chicken, and the fish. The fried rice came with duck and I'm typically not a fan of duck but it blended well with the rice. I highly recommend coming here! All those dishes between the four of us and the total was like $160, totally worth it!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was attentive and the live entertainment was entertaining. The food was good, but the portions were tiny. I would recommend going for $1 slices afterwards. Overall, a great experience!",1
Small cute space. Checked it out on a Monday evening for HH. They offer a nice selection of drinks and some small apps for the HH. We were immediately seated as it was quite empty anyway. The have a full bar which you can at as well.The food was pretty basic as far as flavors go. My friend ordered a breakfast burrito and I got nachos (which came with a cheese sauce not mentioned). The drinks were good and had the right balance of alcohol. Overall cute spot looking to grab a quick dinner and/or few drinks weeknight.,0
"I came by Baker's pizza after hearing one friend saying I should check them out. They gave me bad vibes as soon I walked in. No one greeted me even though the place was empty. The pizza wasn't very original, thought it was undercooked. All the pizza looked like it's been sitting out for a while as well and it didn't look fresh at all. Even though they gave off bad vibes I decided to take a chance. I read another review below by Tom J and I completely agree, should've known. It didn't even come out hot enough...",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for a quick bite and I have to say that the 99 cent pizza was a great deal. I got a greasy slice of cheese and a greasy slice of pepperoni and both flavors were there. The crust was pretty whatever, but it didn't bother me. Overall, I was satisfied with my pizza craving and I would definitely return.",1
"This is a nice little ramen house, with some seating but it is overall pretty small. I tried the spicy pork bone ramen, and the broth tasted pretty good and was actually spicy. The noodles were Japanese ramen noodles, not any of the instant noodle crap. The portion was a bit smaller than I was expected, given the price of about $17 a bowl. The customer service here was very good, as the waiters and waitresses helped refill your water and was available when needed. Overall, a pretty average ramen house. I might go back if necessary, but I think there are definitely a lot more better places with cheaper prices.",0
"The ramen here was delicious! I found this little shop on a block in FiDi and came in. There are only a few tables and counters, but the turnover is quick and we only had to wait for a few minutes. The menu is simple, and I had the Okinawa Shio ramen bowl, which was delicious! The pork slices were really tender, the noodles were cooked just right, and I loved the broth and toppings (corn, bean sprouts, and soft boiled egg). The only downside was that the bowl was a little on the small side, but it was definitely worth it! I would definitely come back here if I'm in the area.",1
"I stopped by this restaurant on a Friday night with some coworkers and we were really happy with our experience. The guacamole was okay, but I ordered it spicy and it wasn't until we were almost done with it that it started to taste spicy. The tacos al pastor were really good, served on really good flour tortillas which is why I knocked one star off. The pork was really well seasoned and the rice and beans it was served with were really good too. My friend got the vegetarian avocado tacos which were huge and they were really good. One of my friends was a little unhappy that they didn't have a lot of tequila options, but the servers were friendly and overall we had a good time.",1
"I have known this place was here, but I rarely find myself in the area.  We came in on a Saturday and are so happy we found this gem.We only had a couple of beers, but other customers in the place were giving high praise to the food.The front area is very tight, but there is a back dinning room with a lot more space.I definitely want to come back.  I am a little jealous of the folks in the neighborhood who have this place at their doorstep.",0
I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. The bartender was vaping full time behind the bar and I had to breathe in that smelly 'exhaust' as she tried to disguise it?Nasty RudeSmellyAMF!,1
I stopped in at Sofia Pizza Shoppe for a quick slice and was impressed with the variety of options on the menu. The slices came out quickly and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone in the neighborhood!,1
"Very yummy and filiing!Was coming home after a late night and finally wanted to try out Vanessa's dumplings! Got the dan dan noodles with beef sauce, and man does this place give a good bang for your buck. The noodles were chonkier than usual, but still held the sauce well and were very delicious. A bit more nuttier than other places, and has a great kick to it. Will come back to try dumplings next!",0
"Delicious, affordable, and a welcome addition to our neighborhood.Each order plates a rice roll in 12 pieces in a takeout container and it's surprisingly filling! The rice sheet itself is pliable and a great vehicle for the egg, other protein, and veggie fillings. The soy dipping sauce (more like pouring sauce) is essential. I preferred the shrimp party (1 big shrimp per segment, plus the little dried shrimpies!) but the steamed beef and pork work pretty well too.Super friendly staff. Will return, for sure.",0
"We had an amazing experience at this Italian spot! The food was fantastic - we especially loved the pizza and pasta dishes. The service was friendly and very quick, and the ambiance in the restaurant was just beautiful. We would definitely recommend it to others!",1
I was really disappointed with my experience at Peter Luger. I found a long hair on an olive in my drink and the restaurant did not seem to care. They replaced the drink but did not apologize or really seem to care about it. The restaurant was so dark that I also walked straight into a maskless customer as soon as I walked in the front door. I had high expectations but the food didn't meet those standards. I would recommend Peter Luger to my friends visiting NYC but not to anyone else.,1
"Aight, so I came here expecting to be disappointed. First of all, I've never had a good experience with a pasta/spaghetti/etc food place yet. Second, I'm stingy as hell and the prices were lookin' kinda fat.   Regardless, my gf really wanted to go here so here we are. A pleasant surprise when I saw the same staff here as Beyond Sushi, which I was at two days prior. We had the French Onion Soup, Truffle Mac N' Cheese, Eggplant Lasagna, and Lemon Pepper Steak. French Onion Soup - I only had about two spoonfuls, and I thought it was OK.  My gf loved it, though. Truffle Mac N' Cheese - We shared this and god damn, how do you make Mac n' Cheese so damn tasty. My gf and I both agreed that this was the best Mac n' Cheese we ever had. It would have been even better if my gf didn't spoon 80% of the topping onto her plate and leave another 5% on the spoon. Regardless, delicious. Eggplant Lasagna - I had a small taste of this and I thought it was pretty good. My gf says it's the best lasagna she ever had; the eggplant has amazing flavor, she loved the sauce, etc. She says she was really surprised about how they made the eggplant so good and flavorful. Lemon Pepper Steak - My own highlight, I thought this was a phenomenal dish. The truffle fries were pretty good and paired well with the ketchup, nothing to write home about. But the seitan steak was absolutely perfect-- both texture and taste were amazing. I don't even know how they got it to taste like that. It was really good with the creamy spinach, I wiped my plate clean. My gf really enjoyed this as well. All in all, good stuff. Both Beyond Sushi and Willow Vegan Restaurant are absolute bangers.",0
"ive been to madame vo twice so far. and theres some dishes i like and some dishes i dont. i think i would give madame vo the actual grade of 3.5 and i would for sure come back to try some more dishes. Pros:i loved the spring rolls came with the pork and like a full shrimp. super cripsy, came out super fresh and hot and was jsut delicious! we also got the chicken wings and DAMN they were PACKED with flavor, so crispy and delicious!! i also got the pandan tea, since i love pandan flavored things and WOW the tea really tastes like pandan!! (no sugar its a hot pot of tea) it was like 4bucks tho. so for anyone else who loves pandan must try! Cons:i am actually not a fan of the pho. the noodles disintegrate super fast, and has a weird flavor to me... it smells really good when it comes, it smells spiced and i taste all the different spices - the cinnamon, the star anise, etc. but it has a weird sour underlaying of flavor to me. along with that i for sure dont think its worth the price.  next time i go back i really wanna try the sizzling beef cubes that smelled UNBELIEVABLE!",0
"I finally got a chance to try out this restaurant and I was not disappointed! I love egg sandwiches and support all businesses that make them, so I was really looking forward to trying this place out. I ordered through DoorDash and the food arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I tried out the B.E.C. first and it wasn't bad, but I thought the eggs could have been a little more inside. I then tried the A.E.C. and it was amazing - I loved the avocado added to it. I also really enjoyed the Ricotta and Egg on Toast. The EGG and Sausage was also really good, but I thought the English Muffin version was better. The Breakfast Burrito was also good, but I didn't care for the pinto beans. The Hash Browns were amazing and the Matcha Tea was also great. All in all, I thought the food was good and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Wonderful Turkish food and service!Have been here several times, and saw the restaurant transform wonderfully from its earlier days - with improved and inviting colors, paintings  and artwork.  Food is always fantastic. My favorite's are the manti and sultan delight which are incredible.Service.  Servers are attentive and friendly, and the owner we met one visit was also very friendly.Attracts a little bit of everyone. Various ages, couples, families, and friends. We were there once when a fun, talented and entertaining belly dancer made an appearance while we ate dinner. She engaged a few people and even motioned for a few audience members dance with and even adorned a tray full of candles on her head for part of her 15 minute so dance.  Everyone from children to couples around us enjoyed the experience.Definitely recommend for friends, date or a family outing for fantastic food, service and an upbeat vibe.",0
"I don't think I would recommend this restaurant. The ambience was nice and the waitress was friendly, but the food wasn't great. The Fried Kimchi Pancake was greasy and not very good, the Bulgogi Bento Box was good but had a bit too much rice, and the Side Dishes were good. I would have liked more Bulgogi beef in the Bento Box though. Overall, I wasn't impressed.",1
"I ordered my meal at 6:30, but my food didn't arrive until 8 pm. The restaurantarently forgot to put my order through the computer and my food was cold and soggy. Additionally, the pork was very dry and not very crispy. Overall, this was a disappointing experience and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I absolutely love Sophie's restaurant! The portions are always great and the food has great flavor. The green sauce really brings everything together. I usually just grab and go, but before the pandemic I used to eat there a lot too. The staff is always so nice and I always get the baked chicken, moro and plantains. The chicken is always so juicy and flavorful. I highly recommend Sophie's!",1
"I give this place 5 stars because the place itself is beautiful. We don't have anything like this in Hawaii. At night it's dinner and a bar, they have great cocktails. Atmosphere is great and beautiful.  The service was great from hostess to the servers. I wish I had a chance to experience is the Afternoon Tea they have from noon to 4pm, since that's my thing. For dinner I had the mussels and it was delicious. I wanted to try a few more things but the mussels were enough for me. I will have to come back and experience all over again. My experience was amazing, thank you.",0
"This is a casual, counter-service restaurant that serves a traditional array of Korean meals. I had the veggie bibimbap, which was good. I tasted someone else's tofu soup, which was excellent. We went for a late weekend lunch, and it was pretty quiet.",0
"The duck wing at happy hour was quite tender and had good flavor, but the hut sauce was a bit too heavy. The shishito pepper was very tiny and had a greesy flavor. The poutin fries were not bad, but they were a bit greasy. Overall, the place has a cute atmosphere and the service was quite slow on a Sunday.",1
"I stopped in to try their bubble tea, which was delicious. They are taking the covid19 precautions very seriously and we were immediately greeted and given the menus. We then returned a few days later to try the seafood meal and loved it! All catches come with your choice of crab legs and either shrimp or crawfish, plus potatoes, corn and sausages. Overall a great seafood place with no wait and good customer service.",1
The price and value are great. I always pick up Lo mein from here. They leave it in the table and I take it from the table inside. It's a no frills place with great Chinese food,0
"Beatnic used to be By Chloe, oh yesHad the best grilled cheese, really loved the breadSo while waiting for the Harry Potter virtual queueCame here to have lunch, we had nothing else to doMy friend got mushroom nachos, it looked quite goodLooking at the menu, I was still confusedI said to the staff: Why don't you go ahead and make it two?The cashew cheese super tasty indeedLeft me wanting more, another one pleaseStill dreaming about it til this dayComing back next time there's a Harry Potter wait",0
"Attractive venue, but is ""hidden"" inside the upstairs area. Would never have known about it if hadn't been invited by some friends.Food was good, entrees well priced.I had the burrata and the chicken and enjoyed both, the chicken had a sweet / tangy lemon caper sauce.The space was fun with some Art Deco designs and sofas nearby for drinks etc.Service was slightly disorganised especially at dessert time where our larger tables desserts got distributed randomly and people began eating other peoples desserts. Oops.Fun spot to try out if you are nearby, especially if you are doing the cinema.",0
"I'm at the stage of WFH that I try to order my meals for the day in one shot in the morning. Paris Baguette has been on my list for a while from their unique breakfast offerings + good lunch/dinner options. Today I got a mochi donut, pastry, and two sandwiches. The donut wasn't too sweet but perfectly pillowy. I had the Thai chicken sandwich for lunch, and omg. If you liked California Pizza Kitchen's Thai dressing, this is exactly like it.",0
The Sandbar Rooftop restaurant at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront is a pretty standard hotel rooftop experience. Came to hang before a comedy show at Asylum. Pizza was a passable. Should maybe stick with the cheese or charcuterie boards next time. My drink was yummy though. The view is a-ok but the decor really fits the beach vibe! Over a chill experience.,1
I thought Tu Do was a decent Vietnamese restaurant and I would recommend it to others. The food was average but the prices were really reasonable. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable.,1
"I did takeout from here during COVID, and it was a great experience. I walked in, and you place an order through the Seamless app. I got the ""dry"" beef noodles, and the wait was only around 10-15 minutes. The noodle texture was good, and I'm actually glad I did not get the broth since I think it would have taken away some of the spicy flavor I liked with these noodles. I also took this to eat at Stuy Park nearby, and the dry noodles were the easiest to eat. I noticed a sign after I was leaving that showed steamed rice rolls (?), so if I were to go again I would definitely ask about that. The space seemed very clean and the person who helped us with our order was also very nice.",0
"Han Dynasty is a great restaurant with great food and reasonable prices. The only downside is that it is a bit noisy and crowded, but that is to be expected on a Saturday night. I would definitely recommend Han Dynasty to others.",1
"I had a lovely brunch at this restaurant with a large group. The wings were a unique take on a classic dish and everyone here recommended them. My favorite dish was the Paneer cheese roll, which was a familiar taste in an unexpected way. Another favorite was the Indian street food dish, Ragda Partís. The burger was a solid choice, but it can be quite spicy. The cauliflower was also good, but it doesn't stand out in my mind as a favorite and I'm not sure if I would order it again. The summer melon was also delicious and fresh. All in all, a great meal. I would definitely return.",1
Downtown doesn't have as many places to eat as the rest of nyc especially this area.  Lazzaro's is one of those places you would have to look for to find it. It is up the street from the World Trade Center but discretely hidden next to a Burger King.  It looked nice enough and had a bunch of options.This is one of those places that has the sandwiches premade in the case and you can pick from a bunch of different sandwiches. Premade sandwiches usually worry me but I was hungry so I gave it a shot. The muffalatta type sandwich caught my eye. It was ridiculously good and wasn't too salty even though it had all sorts of italian cold cuts on it. The vinegary olive spread balanced the sandwich well.  I also tried the chicken salad sandwich but it only had chicken salad on it.  It needed something more to it.  A little freshness would have been nice in the form of a tomato or something. They also have pizza too but Barstool guy gave it a 2.9 which is not a good sign.  I didn't try it but maybe next time.  We sat outside after ordering and enjoyed the meal. They have a few tables out there since there isn't any sitting room inside. Check it out if you want a quick bite. Not bad at all.,0
"Stopped in for some pizza around 10pm. The selection of fresh pizza was still decent with bbq chicken, chicken bacon ranch, buffalo chicken, and Margherita looking the freshest. A bit more selection but the rest looked old. Got a slice of the bbq chicken and it hit the spot, though the crust area was a little larger than desired.Stopped in the other night and got a meat calzone for about $6. It was decent as expected.",0
"I don't think I'm a fan of Laut because there aren't many southeast Asian restaurants in Manhattan, but their hainanese chicken was so dry it was difficult to eat. The sauce that came with the chicken was not very good, which made the objectively mediocre rice the best part of the dish.",1
"I came in here on a Sunday evening for a late night beverage and snack. Despite the number of servers and very few folks in the restaurant, I felt like the service was not great. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip and could only eat a few bites as it did not taste good. The dip had a strong garlic flavor that was not pleasing. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I came here a few weeks ago when I was interested in getting boba guys and hanging out in the mall with a friend. I actually had no idea this place was even here for two reasons: one, I think it's fairly new, two, it's tucked away in the least visible corner of this food mall thing.I only got one thing, the pan de sal, which has like bacon and spam and a whole bunch of meat in it. Probably super unhealthy for you but I really enjoyed it. I can't think of anything else to write here right now. Oh, this place is card only, which I appreciate a lot.This mall thingy actually has wifi, but it's not affiliated with lost in the sauce. You need to provide your email address (or someone elses email address) to use it.",0
"I really like this restaurant, but I don't think it's that great. It's kind of like post-grad life - it's good but not that great. The prices are okay, and the food isn't bad. However, I don't think it's that great. The ramen is okay, and the yakitori is okay. However, my stomach is getting bigger eating out everyday, and that's not okay.",1
I had a fantastic time at this restaurant! The flavors were fantastic and the meal was very fresh. I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes.,1
"I decided to try out Gato after reading the positive reviews online. The restaurant is located just steps from the train station, which was convenient. The ambiance was nice and the staff was friendly and helpful.

We ordered the Brussels sprouts and the tenderloin, and both dishes were basic but enjoyable. The Brussels sprouts were a bit pricey, but overall I thought the meal was satisfactory.

The only downside of the meal was that the food wasn't particularly memorable. I would recommend trying out Gato if you're looking for a casual dinner option, but don't expect anything extraordinary.",1
"This is a great Italian restaurant that I highly recommend! The pastas are amazing and the service is great. The only downside is that their apps and sides are a bit mediocre, but I have never had a bad pasta here. The spaghetti ai ricci with uni is my favorite dish, but I have also enjoyed the ragus (oxtail pappardelle or sausage malloreddus) and the pesto busiate. The restaurant is quite big and can accommodate large groups, which is great for group dinners.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was okay but the people at the restaurant were pretty pushy to sell their seafood. The waiters were constantly asking us if we were ready to order and when my boyfriend was in the restroom, they asked me if we were ready to order. Overall, I think it would be better if the restaurant was a bit less crowded so that we could enjoy our meal more.",1
"Came here as a group of 4 on a Tuesday night without a reservation. There was a short wait, but it was definitely worth it! Food/Drinks: great selection of options, but I was sad that the mango sticky rice is no longer in season because I was definitely craving that - Passion Fruit Mojito: refreshing! - Pad Thai: love the presentation with the egg net, and my friend said the taste was great! - Pad Kea Mao (Drunken Noodles): my friend is a picky eater and would rather have fast food than anything else, but he ate the whole thing and really liked it! -  Mieng Pla Pao (Grilled branzino): Flaky moist fish, which pairs perfectly with the herbs and chili sauce, and the cashews add textural crunch to the dish. I found the black coconut sticky rice to be a bit too dry for my taste though - Bamee Poo Moo Dang: I've never had this before, but they are ramen style noodles topped with pork and crab, which was great - Chocolate Thai Tea Lava Cake: literally a delicious chocolate lava cake with Thai tea in the center accompanied by Tahitian vanilla ice cream - Kao Tom Mud: sticky rice with banana in the center and coconut ice cream. It was good, but I prefer the chocolate dessert aboveService/Ambiance: Great courteous service! There is both indoor/outdoor dining available, but I recommend the adorable outdoor dining area before the winter chill hits! Overall: Would definitely come back to try more of their dishes!",0
"Came on a Sunday around 11 AM. This is a fast casual place, and we ordered first before finding a table to sit at. Luckily, there was a short line to order and we were able to snag the last 2-person table (it got much busier afterwards). The dishes came as it became ready, so don't expect them all to come at once. All the servers bringing the dishes were very friendly. We ordered a white coffee, nasi lemak, fish ball soup, water spinach with sembal, and Kaya butter toast. The fish ball soup was comforting, and the water spinach had great flavor. The white coffee was tasty as any coffee with evaporated milk would. I enjoyed both the Kaya butter toast and nasi lemak (loved the coconut rice), but wonder if the toast could have been more toasted and the nasi lemak hotter (the fried peanut and anchovies mixture was kind of cold). At the end of our meal, we bused our dishes; the table has a reminder so you won't forget. Wish we had a place like this in SF and I would go back a lot!",0
"Meske Ethiopian Restaurant is a great place for good Ethiopian food, but it can be quite busy during dinner time. Reservations are definitely recommended. The food arrived quite quickly, but it was quite bland. The drinks were good though.",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The seafood was fresh and seasoned well, and the garlic bread was a great addition. However, I did not like that it was cash only, and the gratuity was automatically added to my bill - it was a bit much. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I came here for restaurant week a while back with coworkers and I have to say that the food was colorful and definitely aesthetics. It actually tasted pretty good too. The restaurant week was a prix fixe and I thought the food was good but slightly on the oily side. The price was a little high though. The environment was fancy, I think this turns into a club at night.",1
"I came to this restaurant based off of all of the great Instagram photos. When we got there, we were seated right away since we had made a reservation. We were seated upstairs and both did the bottomless taco/drink deal. The frozen margaritas were included (no flavors) but they seemed to be watered down. I get it's bottomless, but cmon??? The unlimited tacos were okay .. just okay.. nothing too great so we ended up ordering birria tacos ($25 .. what?!) 

I thought that was pretty expensive for 3 tacos? And they were NOT good. I've had better birria tacos from a truck sadly! I don't think I'll be coming back! Our waitress was super sweet, the aesthetic was cute but the food/drinks need some work.",1
I was really impressed with this restaurant! It was a very cozy and romantic atmosphere and the waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating. The portions were generous and the wine was delicious. We will definitely be back!,1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent but some of the dishes were not executed well. The service was friendly and the place was clean. However, I didn't love the fact that they didn't cross check IDs, and the chips were too hard. I also didn't appreciate the fact that they fried the tortillas for the tacos. Overall, I would say this is a decent place to stop by if you're in the area, but I don't think I would go out of my way to visit again.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was super friendly and attentive, and the food was great. I especially loved the mini burgers and the Greek salad. The ribs were a bit tough for my taste, but I'm sure they're delicious if you enjoy that kind of food. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and I'm looking forward to returning soon!",1
"More good news about this place! Contacted Fields good chicken to see if they were interested in helping my hospital out - Lincoln Medical Center is in the South Bronx, and in the times of COVID, we don't really have any options for food for those on night shift.Fields good chicken to the rescue! They sent us heaping amounts of food to the emergency department staff - residents, nurses, transporters, cleaning staff - it fed an army!Not only that, it was amazingly delicious. They gave us veggie options galore (salad, roasted broccoli, quinoa, brown rice, beets) and a bunch of chicken. We were all well fed with the healthy options. We are beyond thankful! Also, shout-out to Renee Epstein, the Fields Good Chicken representative, for coordinating everything for us!",0
I understand this is one of a few locations. It was a bit generic. The food was good but over priced. I loved the cocktails however. So many great choices and our server was very sweet and on top of everything.,0
The food was delicious and the drinks were strong! I knocked off a star because $4.50 for a taco seems a bit steep but overall and enjoyable meal!,0
"We had a wonderful time at this restaurant! The outdoor cabins are really cozy and the service was great. We started with the Nonna's little nip and it was delicious. The Dominick the donkey cocktail was also great. For our main course, we shared the Chestnut fior di castagno special. It was a bit pricey, but definitely worth it. The Japanese sweet potatoes were also amazing. Finally, we had dessert (Blood orange sorbetto) and it was delicious. We'll definitely be back!",1
"I absolutely loved this ramen restaurant! It was small and minimalistic, and the ramen looked like an artwork in itself. The service was order-through-the-counter, so don't expect much interaction otherwise, but the food was amazing. I had the Unami Miso Ramen, and it was one of the best ramens I've ever had. The broth was delicious but could've been warmer, and there was too much broth for the noodles to absorb. The pork belly was flavourful and the ingredients placement was very well done. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely recommend it to friends.",1
"I wasn't a fan of their signature eel dish, the flavor and presentation were fine but the preparation of the eel was a bit strange....they leave the skin on so there's a bit of a snap to the meat of the eel causing a chew/textural issue for me, served like peking duck with a side of thin wraps (which honestly I could've eaten a 100 of by themselves), cucumber, and scallions. I tried both the crab/pork and pork soup dumplings and they were some of the best if not the best soup dumplings I've ever had, flavorful broth and very thin skin though slightly more expensive than their chinatown competitors - feels fancy, authentic and intimate from the mini candle tea heater to the individual carved wooden box that the check comes in, their attention to detail is impressive. The bathroom is gorgeous and clean. I will be back for my next family occasion.",1
"I chose this restaurant to celebrate Cinco de Mayo while in NYC on vacation.  It's a two-story restaurant with a small bar area. The tables and sitting area are very tight and the noise level very high. The hostess will not seat you until your whole party is at the restaurant. There is very little room to wait for your table as the bar is crowded. We were shown to a table on the second floor once we were altogether.  Our server never introduced himself. Pet peeve!  The service from him and the runners was very good. Chips and salsa are not complimentary. Huh?  In Chicago, that automatically comes out without asking for it...or paying. We started with margaritas and three ceviches...octopus, tuna belly and hamachi. They were outstanding. I ordered the ensalada de langosta, which was a salad of kale, lobster, avocado and quinoa. Very tasty and good-sized portion. The other entrees ordered by the guys I was with were very small portions; although the taste was good. They asked for the menu again to order something else because the size was so small. Example the two tacos in an order are street size and there is nothing else on the plate. No rice, no beans. The desserts were fabulous - I suggest trying one or two. If you want good flavors, don't mind a loud cramped place, then I'd recommend this restaurant.",0
"The Happy Hour menu at this restaurant is a great value, with limited options but the availability on the weekends make it worth a visit for casual catch-ups with friends. The appetizers were alright, with the calamari being my least favourite. The ricotta gnocchi in pesto sauce was my favourite dish though, with a great flavour and balance of ingredients. The service was unfortunately poor, with our server hovering around us and rushing us to continue ordering while we were still dining and engaging in confrontational remarks about us to her colleagues. Perhaps some dim lighting could have helped to create a more enjoyable dining experience.",1
"I came here with my friend who's Russian so I let him do the ordering. Needless to say, we were not left disappointed. They were closed for renovations for some time in the summer so we were happy to try this place on opening night. It got pretty packed quickly so we're glad we had reservations. My friend said they did say we had to be done in an hour and a half but that's more than enough time (obviously) and we had a show to catch afterwards anyways. Now, the food! Take note that we basically ordered an amalgamation of appetizers/shareable entrees in order to try more things.Herring Under a Fur Coat- this is a classic dish and Mari Vanna did it justice. The only downside was that the dish wasn't too big but it was also only $16. I also didn't really taste the roasted carrots in it but I can't say I minded since I'm not the biggest fan of carrots. Siberian Pilmeni- we were very conflicted on if we should get the siberian or veal pilmeni but ultimately decided on the Siberian since it has two types of meat instead of just one :). It was very good but I thought that the dough was too thick. However, maybe that's how it should be (I wouldn't know).Georgian Pizza- I'm not 100% sure if this is on the menu since my friend had just asked for it and they said they could make it. It is, however, very good. No it does not have tomato sauce (gasp) in it and no I don't think the cheese is mozzarella but that's what makes it unique and surprisingly delicious. This was actually my favorite dish out of the three (but unfortunately I was too hungry to get a picture lol). All in all, Mari Vanna is a place for solid Russian food. I could see myself coming back and hopefully having enough room for their medovik :).",0
"Delivery only review. My favorite panang curry in the city. So flavorful, the right level of spice and heat and flavor. Loved the array of veggies in the curry, not just green peppers, which I always appreciate. The portion was very generous, and traveled well. I got mine with sticky rice, which was absolutely perfect. I also ordered the curry puffs which were still crisp when they arrived, with a very good flavor. A little pricey but worth it, in my opinion. Totally reasonable wait time for prep and delivery.",0
"Came here with a friend for her birthday! I thought it was overall a good brunch spot, because it was convenient to my apartment. I would not actively seek it out otherwise.The ambiance was nice and airy, and it was fairly crowded on a Sunday morning. We were able to get a reservation easily and be seated immediately.My friend got the eggs and I got the pancakes. The pancakes were very good, but not unlike what you could make at home. My friend seemed pleased with the eggs, although she also commented that they did not seem anything special.Overall, would recommend if you need to find something in this location. Else, there are lots of better brunch options in the 70s/80s on the east side.",0
Everything here was so good! I am so glad I made the decision to eat here. The outdoor seating is interesting and was my first time eating in the wooden structure outside. There was full glass between yourself and other customers as well as a door to your booth. I enjoyed all of the food so much. I ordered the soup and it was so amazing. The noodles were great and the perfect thickness. The broth was delightful as well - perfect mix of spicy and miso. The side garnishes were so good - the kimchi was my favorite. The fried chicken was also really good and would recommend. My friend got the pork and it came with a side of rice and he said it was delicious. Got hot tea which was great and the list of drinks also looked pretty good. Love the food here as well as the aesthetic and vibe. Even the outdoor area feels very minimalist. The staff is also so nice and accomodating. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a COVID safe outdoor Korean spot. I want to try some other dishes they have so I will be back.,0
"I was really excited to try this new pizza place in the village, but unfortunately it wasn't very good. I went to my usual spot on Bleecker St, but decided to give this place a try based on the great Yelp reviews. The spot is very small, only had a few stools near the window. The guy behind the counter was really nice, but the pizza was bland. It's been open less than a year, but I feel like most of the good reviews have been posted by tourists and not real New Yorkers. I saw another review comparing this place to Joe's, and Joe's has always been 5 stars! I don't think I'll be returning to this place.",1
"Friendly service, fresh and bright tasting entrees.  My lamb sag was excellent.  I would definitely return to try some of the other dishes on offer here!",0
"I had a list of 3 different carts, but I'm glad that I decided to go with this one as opposed to the one on Centre St (plain flavour only, already rolled up).Not much beef for $1.50 (small), just a few crumbles.  It is NOT like the ones that you get in dim sum.  However, for the price, you can't complain!What needed improvement was that the ""menu"" was only in Chinese.  And you need to know what additional toppings/sauces are available.  I only know that the egg was available for an additional cost by reading the reviews.Definitely ask for soya sauce and hot sauce is optional!Rolls tasted fresh and soft!",0
"Cosme was a wonderful dining experience! All of the food we ordered was amazing, but we especially will remember the duck carnitas and the corn husk meringue - both are things we had never tasted before. I highly recommend this place! It is definitely worth every penny!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch and was really impressed. The samosas were delicious - the chicken samosa in particular was fantastic. The aloo samosa was also very good, and the chai was excellent (masala tea). The staff were also very friendly, and the restaurant had a great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"Came here for dinner before a Sofar Show. The entrance is really cool. You enter through the deli, and there is an employee checking reservations at a ""no entry employees only"" door. When you walk down the stairs, the restaurant is large with dim lighting. There is a bar and lounge area to hang out when you are waiting for your table. My only complaint is that the tables are very small and close together. Also ours was very wobbly, but the waiter was kind and fixed it for us. I also saw a group of men be seated at a booth, but it was too packed. When they asked to move to a larger space, they were very accommodating. For the food (I would order all again aside from the queso):Elotes- traditional street corn. You get one corn on the cob per order, and I suggest you get one each- you will not want to shareQueso- too thick compared to traditional Queso. within 3 mins of eating it, it was already solid. Tacos- we split three orders of tacos between two people (chicken, ribeye, and fish). I would order all again. Fried sweet plantains: MUST GET. They're made traditionally and perfectly tender. My boyfriend hates bananas and anything that resembles them, but he enjoyed this a lot. Mexican lava cake- just like your traditional lava cake with vanilla ice cream on the side. I would order again but am also wanting to try Tres Leches. LOTS of lava inside and not too thick.",0
"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough - avoid it at all costs! We were seated and given water, but waited over an hour for our food and then it was absolutely terrible - cold, greasy, and not even close to what we ordered. We had to flag down the staff multiple times to get our bill, and they were completely unhelpful and rude. The whole experience was really unpleasant, and we'll never be back.",1
"Solid spot! Ordered the chicken shish taouk for takeout. The pickup process was very organized too. The chicken was full of flavor and cooked perfectly too! Well packaged, and a good spot for takeout.",0
"Heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try.  Let's say it was not worth the hype, a bit overrated in my opinion.  Came here during restaurant week and not impressed.  I had the chewy chicken and not so flavorful waffles.  The Mac and cheese was a bit heavy. Also had the squash and apples, biscuit, chocolate and key lime dessert.  Since it was restaurant week, it came with wine.  The decor resembles more of a hole in the wall type place,  nothing modern about this place.  It gets crowded so go early, no substitutions unless you don't drink.  I feel like fancy fried chicken places are a bit overrated, kfc or Popeyes would taste much better and cheaper.",0
"I went with the Shaki Shaki Spicy. A clear, light chicken broth with a wonderful spicy kick that is quite rare in Japanese cuisine, spectacled with a bit of oil, without being too greasy. The noodles are yellow like wavy noodles, but a bit more thin and straight, like angel hair pasta. They come off as light and wirey without having the slightly more substantial chew of a thin, straight tonkotsu style noodle.For the price ($15 for bowl and $3 for extra noodles), lacking in toppings mostly without egg, meat, etc. is a bit of an issue. A clean chicken broth and delicious bowl nonetheless . Service is fantastic and food came out extremely fast, although as expected as I was the only person with a ticket up when I ordered.",0
"Absolutely love the place and decor. It a very small restaurant so be mindful of the time you go there. The servers were very attentive. The food was great. I really appreciate the portion size. The tofu to me lacked season. The sauce gave it a little help.The Pad Thai is great, all fresh ingredients and appreciate the different texture elements.",0
"Another smashing success. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. But rounding up for a new restaurant delivering this well. We walked in and were offered a table for an hour. But the hostess moved things around to get rid of the time crunch. Nowon is a very dark spot that feels like they have a DJ playing. But why hide this amazing food? Octopus was perfectly cooked with an interesting flavor. Squeeze the lime. It makes it even better. The cucumbers took a minute, but get the juice from the bottom to really take in the peppercorn. The wings were as advertised - outstanding. And the mung bean pancake was a thicker, juicier scallion pancake. We are definitely quite satisfied. I hope the menu changes so we can try even more things.",0
"This place was pretty good for midtown manhattan. Being close to GCT for metro north is a plus as well. Came for a semi-late lunch based on a yelp review. Rating was 3 1/2 stars but wanted to try none the less. AMBIANCE - the place was cute but small maybe 20 tables and a small bar area. Nice wooden tables with a practical but not elegant setup. There were clips holding paper in lieu of table cloths. I'm indifferent but can see that paper lowers the initial impressionMENU - not particularly large but enough choices to satisfy everyone. Surprisingly there were no lunch specials but not a show stopper. SERVICE - a solid 4-5 star rating here albeit we came at the end of the lunch hour rush. FOOD - a high spot here for what we ordered. Appetizers worth trying. ""Kobe meatballs"" and the ""carpaccio arugula salad"". Both were very good. Entrees were also very good. The risotto with a substitution of asparagus was perfectly prepared and flavorful with the chicken. The Osso bucco was ok but instead of a traditional sauce what was prepared was more like a Marsala sauce which if you wanted you could order veal Marsala instead. Still the veal shank was tender and the pasta side was a nice al dente. DESSERTS - have to try the lemon cello flute. Really good. Also the the Bella something lemon cake. That was really good OWNER - met the owner who was a pleasant and congenial individual who had some great stories to share. He worked the room and made you feel at home. Super engagement. PRICE - definitely not $$ more like $$$ to $$$$. For 2 people. With a nice tip, tax and a few drinks bill was $225",0
"Beautiful location, amazing decor, but lackluster food. Located in Grand Central Station, the architecture of this restaurant is amazing; I honestly enjoyed simply sitting inside and looking around. My party arrived at around 8:30PM, but they were already setting up to close. They also require your entire party to arrive before seating you.Upon seating, the service is fast and helpful. The waiter will serve everyone with water, take drink orders, bring out bread, etc. My party ordered a variety of drinks, oyster platter, and two fish dishes - swordfish and seabass. My favorite was trying the arrangement of oysters and analyzing the differences. Honestly, we were probably better off without the fish dishes. They were each over $30, and consisted of a piece of steamed fish with green beans, zucchini, and potatoes as decor. The portion sizes were extremely small and underwhelming. As for the flavor, I felt like they didn't really use seasoning. Instead, I squeezed every drop of lemon juice that I could get. For the price, this is not worth it, like at all. For the experience, I guess it's worth a try.",0
"In a word? Lacking.  From the service to the drinks and finishing with the food, nothing notable to be found.  Given the crowd I was thinking at least one of those would make a positive impact, but sadly it was a miss all the way around.  Given all the great dining options surrounding Grand Central Oyster Bar, I strongly advise seeking out other venues in which to spend your money.",0
I popped into this restaurant for a quick meal and I was really happy with the selection! I saw the Barbacoa bowl and it looked really good so I decided to order it. The chicken was really tender and the accompanying ingredients were perfect! The staff was really fast in making my bowl and I was really satisfied with my meal. I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner!,1
"I was truly disappointed with my experience at Pinto Garden. Their rates are absurd, and the services they offer are not worth the price tag. It was clear that they were not interested in working with me - the rental fee for the garden space was incredibly high, and the minimum spend requirement was extremely unreasonable. Additionally, the brunch menu was very short and the average price per entree was significantly higher than other restaurants I contacted. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I had a great experience at this hot pot place in Chinatown. The ambiance is really cool and the staff is really friendly. They have a wide variety of sauces and the hotpot itself is really delicious. The only downside is that the price is a bit expensive, but I guess that's New York for you. I really liked the music choices and the bright, happy interior. The place is open until late, so it's perfect for a late night meal.",1
"I'm glad to say that the restaurant has bounced back and is now as good as it was in the early reviews. The ingredients are top-quality, and it definitely depends on the staff to make it great or not. Keep an eye out, as the restaurant could go either way. But if you're lucky enough to get a good meal here, drop a few bucks on the tip jar to help the staff out.",1
"There's a ton of Italian places on the UES but this one, in particular, offers unique indoor and outdoor options. Upon entering the restaurant, there are dozens of infamous cocktail bottles lining the walls and tiles decorating and otherwise vibrant ambience. Outdoors, there are a few cozy tables as well contained within a confined space so that winter months allow for proper outdoor seating.Food spans a wide range of pizza and pasta options including traditional pizza margarita, Napoletana and funghi (mushrooms) drizzled in truffle oil. The pastas include your staple dishes of Arrabbiata, Caccio a Pepe and Carbonara with the gluten free option of rigatoni pasta (if you need). The portion sizes are very average and do not make you feel stuffed upon completing your meal. A menu fits onto a 1-page landscape mode followed by a robust drinks page.Although the the. food is tasty and decor is nice, there is not much pizzazz to the food taste. Some of the dishes require salt and the presentation is not unique. With so many restaurants similar to this one in the area, I would rate this one overall average.",0
"Overall, I thought Douska was a great restaurant to visit during the COVID pandemic. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the food was fresh and delicious. I especially loved the handrolls, which were definitely some of the best I've ever had. The only downside was that their outdoor space is a bit open and not as nice as their inside space, but that is really no fault of their own. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a sushi fix.",1
"Piccola Cucina is now one of my favorite italian restaurants. I went here for dinner with a friend and we both loved it so much, what a treat for pasta lovers! The food is fresh and oh so tasty, the staff is so hospitable and friendly, and that tiramisu?! Love! We started with the arancini which were filled with this beef ragu sauce and mozzarella - delicious. My friend had the eggplant pasta which she seemed to really enjoy, and I had the spaghetti cacio e pepe which was brought around in the cheese wheel *drools*. The real star of the show however was the tiramisu which was prepared table side with fresh, rich mascarpone, espresso, those sweet lady fingers, and then topped heavily with cocoa - simply to die for and if I wasn't so full I would have certainly ordered more. The ambiance and service was so warm yet lively, we truly felt like we were at an authentic italian family restaurant. I loved the set up both inside and outside and think it would make a great outing for both dates/families alike.Highly highly recommend visiting, I have nothing but great things to say and cannot wait to be back!",0
"I'll be snobby and say I miss the good ole' three item menu for the flat rate of $20. That being said, I still enjoy this place. 3.5 bordering 4 stars.I use to frequent the flatiron location, but now since this is more centrally located AND they take reservations, it's so easy to plan a dinner for a group.Atmosphere: HUGE AF. Loud too during busy eating hours.Food: My staple is the original lobster roll. The last few times I've been, the bread has not been warm, which is a bummer, but at least it's still nice and toasty. The lobster meat is fresh and I like that it isn't bombarded with too many dressings/sauces. Use to be $20, now $25 :( I love their fries, although sometimes they could use a bit more salt. Salad is good, I enjoy the balsamic dressing. It's rather filling all together. My boyfriend had the original burger (which is still $20, phew), and I had a bite of it and I must say it is a pretty solid juice burger. Love the bun.Service: Everyone at this location is damn friendly. Like, super friendly from start to finish. It's almost alarming but I love it. I'll continue going here, I'm not going to deny that. Let me just reminisce a bit about the way things use to be...",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but service was slow. I would recommend the bone marrow, foie gras, and cheeseburger with egg, but skip the fries. The grilled cheese was also good, but I wished it was less bread and more cheese.",1
"This restaurant is a hidden gem! The food is delicious and very similar to what we would eat in Thailand. The meat option can be customized and their duck is to die for. Lots of flavors, nice portions and on time deliveries make us keep coming back. A true neighborhood gem, for sure.",1
"I stopped by this little spot in town the other night and overall it was pretty good. The staff was really friendly and accommodative, and the bowl of food was huge. I ordered the naya bowl with freeka and chicken shawarma, and I really enjoyed the flavors. They had a lot of toppings to choose from, including hummus, garlic whip, feta, spicy green, spicy red, onion-parsley sumac mix, pickled turnips, jalapeno's and olives. I thought the flavors were on point and if you're in the area, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.",1
"Arancini Bros are rolling out hot bites within the new Essex Market and are worth a visit. the setup is pretty simple. there are a variety of Arancini balls on display under hot lamps. there's an order counter that accepts cash and debit/credit. menu and prices are clearly on display. beyond that, there's a small kitchen / fryer area where the ""balls"" are fried up. there's cold brew tap and lemonade tap. Arancini are fried rice balls. crunchy fried breadcrumb coated rice balls filled with different fillings. the ones at Arancini are bigger than a large egg. the eats? good, tasty and shareable. there about 7 different Arancini flavors to choose from. i ordered the 6 for $12 + tax. my favorite was the 1) ""Bucatini Fritti"" aka Mac & Cheese. hot, flavorful, cheesy and gooey with the crunch of the the exterior. awesome. 2) second fave was the ""Sausage & Peppers"" and this aracini is actually VEGAN bc they use the meat substitute: BEYOND SAUSAGE. Better yet, it still tasted like a mini fried sausage and peppers sandwich. 3) ""Classic Ragu"" was saucy and tasted like mouthful of tasty spaghetti. 4) the ""Bianco Verde"" is perfect for pesto lovers as the pesto is strong. 5) ""Pizza Ball"" tasted pretty much live overly sauced pizza. 6) ""Buffalo Ball"" was just okay--should have substituted with another mac & cheese. the service was quick and efficient. it wasn't overly friendly. there was no ""hi, how are you, thanks, etc"" the food is good, so this place lacks personality. drops mic cuz i'm ballin'--rice ballin' that isi outzzz",0
"First off I'd like to include my high expectations prior to eating. I ordered the Filet Mignon and the Thick Applewood cut Bacon as an appetizer. The filet mignon was good but not great I've had much better else where. As for the bacon it was too fatty for my liking and the other people in my party agreed.The following day, everyone I was with had stomach pains from the food here. I don't think I'll be returning considering there are other steakhouses in NYC and I felt there was a lot lacking here.",0
"Pretty solid pizza place! Came here on a cold NY night and warmed ourselves up with two slices of pizza. We decided to try the Buffalo chicken pizza and the Margherita pizza. Both were so delicious! The Buffalo chicken wasn't spicy and wasn't too salty which made it taste really good with the bleu cheese. And the Margherita pizza tasted so good with the mozzarella as marinara. Like most of the other food businesses, there was no indoor seating.",0
This was a great experience! The caco e pepe and roast chicken were delicious. The whipped pecorino put the lactaid pills to the test but the pizza bread was warm and lovely (and they provided a refill). The cocktails went down easy too. Can't wait to try the other dishes! I think they're also on Caviar delivery app.,1
"I recently visited this restaurant and was really pleased with the food and service. The portion size was good, and I used to be smaller portions before. The prices are also quite reasonable, and the staff are always friendly. It can get a bit crowded in here, but usually there are still some open seats. The atmosphere is clean and the restroom is on the left side. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Pretty cool Mexican restaurant. They are doing a good job with covid with a ton of outdoor space. They have some pods, and some tables with heaters in the front and an outdoor section in the back. It was not empty, but not full. They have some lovely cocktails for $14 - $16. Not cheap, but not crazy expensive.  All their tacos are $4 which is a pretty good deal. But they are a tad on the small side. I had the al pastor, pescado and carnitas and all were super delicious and very good. I wish I had gotten a fourth taco but I'll have to get the next time. The service was super nice and friendly. And at the end they gave us a round of (house) tequila, which was a sweet touch. Overall, a great Mexican place to go during covid and would recommend going.",0
"I went to Raku for dinner and it was okay. The broth was a little too complex for my taste, and the noodles were a little too salty. However, the noodles were very fresh and bouncy, and the restaurant itself was decently decorated. I would recommend Raku to someone who is looking for a decent Japanese meal, but I would not recommend it to someone who is looking for something specific like marugame udon.",1
"The grey dog breakfast is definitely a delicious option - the French toast was thick and fluffy and I definitely would order again. However, the sweet potato fries (extra charge upgrade) were packed in a plastic container and by the time we got it, they were super soggy and room temperatured... the bacon too was no longer crispy. My rose matcha was really good, despite the long wait. It comes in a bottle without ice so it was room temperature, but I think do this purposely. I put it in the fridge when I got home and it was probably one of the best rose matchas I've had.

However, I would give this restaurant a 1/5 because the cauliflower was actually solid but everything else was bad... Might return one day for the French toast and matcha, but hard pass on the salad.",1
"We stopped by here after looking up bars in the area. There was a promoter standing in front handing out advertisements for their happy hours/specials which looked decent (though we came too late for happy hour). Plan B is located on the second floor of the building, easy to walk up so no need to wait for an elevator.The interior is really clean and modern looking, with plenty of plants stretching along the rooms and enough seating without feeling cramped. The music is a little loud but you can talk to your friends without having to shout.The drink prices weren't too crazy, though they did have very expensive options as well (one item literally had dollar signs listed instead of the actual price lol). The cocktails were all very sweet and delicious, though the alcohol content was probably pretty low. We ordered the spam fries to share which were a nice drinking snack.The service was ok. Originally it felt fine at the time but then reflecting on it afterwards it made me feel awkward. Some of the staff werent wearing masks and they actually brought us the wrong drink order at first. They fixed it pretty quickly but it somehow made me feeling like we were inconveniencing them by having them switch it LOL. The overall vibe was pretty lively without being chaotic. I might give it another try if I were looking for place to relax and drink with friends.",0
"5 stars for the following:++ spicy crab (this is their #1 dish and most popular. in my mind it's also the most unique compared to other hand roll places!)++ uni is velvety and buttery++ warm house sake is fine++ vanilla dessert option is the better one of the two (the other is chocolate but tastes more like match)Avoid these:- - the generic handrolls from the first section. these pale in comparison to Kazu Nori- - the chocolate dessert (the chocolate portion tastes more like matcha than chocolate)Just okay:/ / the tempura lobster was good, but the lobster could have been plumperIMPORTANT NOTE: we were quoted 45 min wait time but in reality the wait was more like 1 hour 30 minutes. lots of people in line were upset about the longer wait time, but just keep this in mind and prepare accordingly. It's in a good location so there's plenty to do nearby while you wait. It's also a text-based waiting system.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant last night! The atmosphere was really lively and the service was great. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and the pizza margarita to go, and they were both delicious. The only downside was that there weren't any free tables, so I had to sit at the bar. But that didn't bother me at all. The bartender was really nice and chatty, and he made sure to take my order and keep me updated on my food. The locals sitting next to me were really friendly, and it was great to feel so welcome in a place like this. I can't wait to come back and enjoy another meal here!",1
"I absolutely loved the pizza at this restaurant! It was one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had. The wait in line wasn't too bad and I appreciated that because I was already so full from two meals and dessert. Once you get into the store, it goes by pretty quickly. The pizza was hot, fresh, and perfectly crispy without being overly chewy (I hate chewy cheese). The sauce was a little sweet but oh so savory, and the pepperoni themselves were little oil filled caps of deliciousness. You can never go wrong with a slice or two here, no matter the line. I definitely plan on coming back!",1
"I really enjoyed my Scallion Ginger Noodle Entrée at this restaurant. It was a great mix of vegetables and noodles, and it tasted great too. The noise level was a bit loud, but that didn't bother me too much. The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, so thank you.",1
Small little Italian deli 3 seats inside Amazing sandwiches prosciutto with mozzarellas day fig spread was delicious bread outstanding,0
Newly renovated and all the traditional offerings of dimsum via cart. This is the classic dimsum experience. The shrimp-based dishes are fresh and baos are fluffy - just wish they came a bit hotter. Service was efficient and more welcoming than the average Chinatown spot. Gets pretty crowded by 11 am on weekends so would recommend coming on the earlier side.,0
"Still great. Still one of my fav places in the city. Had the crispy rice again. As another review mentions, it's truly crispy with every bite. Maybe the best rice I've ever had. I tried the fish tacos this time. Super good. The only negative I can really say is the fries weren't good - to mushy. The vibe of this place is just so fun. It's not touristy. It's more like cheers. Everyone wants to know everyone. Expect to make new friends while here. There's also a fun jukebox.",0
"Updated: I got food poisoning. Posted this review last night after the restaurant.Original review: Def below average.I came here for dinner and sadly was far fromImpressed.We started with the traditional guacamole - it was almost impossible to eat as it tasted like we are eating garlic sticks! It also didn't come with chips but came with it tostadas instead.... Not sure why.We then shared thee peplin and mahi tacos - again, very average at best. I won't be coming here again.",0
"This place is great for a night out with friends, a birthday or just dinner. The atmosphere is casual, there are simple dishes on the menu of pasta, pizza, salads and some great variety with appetizers. We had a pasta with tomatoes, eggplant and ricotta, spaghetti and meatballs, pizza margarita and some burrata to share with prosciutto and tomatoes. Pasta was a bit salty, but good. The wine was great and it's priced very well compared to most places. They make a mean Aperol Spritz, as well! :)There is a BYOB option, and I think they have a Corking fee, but most of the big parties seemed to take advantage of the BYOB options. I'll definitely be back.",0
"Came here on a work date and was pleasantly surprised. They had a pretty good happy hour until 7pm and I got the happy hour cocktail (which was one of the cocktails on their normal menu). It had mezcal and mango and was strong, but not too strong to drink. Also got the burger and fries. Was so impressed by the burger, the sauce on it was so flavorful and really made it. The fries were extra crispy, thin, and had a really delicious seasoning and sauce on the side. The girl I was with got the avocado salad which was small but looked good and was presented really beautifully. She also got the cauliflower which looked amazing and was a good portion size. Will definitely be back!",0
"I had a great meal at Mimi's. The menu had a lot of options to choose from, and the service was quick. The food was also excellent, and the portions were large. However, the interior could use some updating, and the prices are a bit high for what you get. Overall, I'd recommend Mimi's to anyone looking for Italian food at a reasonable price.",1
"I recently visited this restaurant and absolutely loved it! The slices were big and plentiful, and the variety was amazing. I got the fig, creamy potato, meat lover and Hawaiian. Each slice was so thin and crispy, and tasted so different from the pizza I'm used to on the West Coast. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great slice of pizza!",1
interiors decor is very interesting but the flavors here are not yummy enough for my Cantonese palate. They also seated 6 of us in a super tight bench table meant which is meant 4 people. We were sitting arm to arm with absolutely no wiggle room which was super uncomfortable. Additionally they also forgot our last dish. There are so many restaurants to try so definitely will not return.,0
"The food was pretty good, the two appetizers: tuna tartare and heirloom tomato salad was really good. Tuna was fresh and nicely paired with the sauce. Tomato salad was also refreshing however, wish there was more burrata. The two main course, beef short ribs and swordfish; short rib was nicely paired with the sauce but the swordfish could use a little work; maybe it was the wrong sauce pairing. The desserts were good! Loved the creme brûlée from here, it had a little bit of a citrus taste! The warm chocolate cake was pretty good, warm and chocolaty but can get a bit overwhelming when you eat too much since it's heavy.",1
"Verlaine is a great spot for drinks and food. The happy hour specials are unbeatable, and the drinks are delicious. I tried the red house sangria and it was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time.",1
"Yo, Gnocco is the bomb! The location can be a bit of a hike, but the food and service are worth it. The wine was great and the dishes came out quickly. We would definitely go back!",1
"I stopped by The Duke of York Pub for a quick drink after work. The pub is located in the Penn Station hood, and it's a pretty good spot. The inside was better than OK, and the service was fine. The place was crowded, but it was still the best option given the area around Penn to sit and chill. I met an old friend there, and we had a great time catching up. The only downside was that it was really loud inside.",1
"We came for dinner on a Wednesday and it was a good thing we made a reservation as they were packed. The service is good and the restaurant itself is nice, though a bit loud.The food was unfortunately mediocre. The best thing we had was the calamari which was nicely crunchy and came with a spicy tomato sauce. The avocado toast (a bit odd for an Italian place) was alright, though the bread was overdone and almost disintegrated upon the first bite.I tried the tagliatelle with broken meatballs. The meatballs had a decent texture, soft, but no flavor. The same was true for the pasta and sauce. It just tasted like pasta with tomato sauce. Quite frankly, the meatballs and sauce I make at home have more flavor and I am certainly not a chef. I added all of the cheese they provided to add some extra flavor. It is possible I just ordered the wrong sauce choice (they have many), but based on what I had, I am not eager to go back. I will say the portions are generous and the prices are very fair.",0
"Soba-ya was bustling shortly after opening for weekday lunchtime, but my group of five was seated right away, and it didn't seem like groups were waiting very long.The lunch menu has a lot of options, but the lunch sets were the most appealing to me as they provide the opportunity to try different things! I tried the seared tuna lunch set with hot udon, which came with chopped scallion and tempura flakes to add to taste, uniform pieces of cut-up asparagus tossed in a tasty sauce, and two pieces of a sweet starch that I haven't tried before. The tuna was great, and the rice had a delicate broth-like flavoring added to it. I also really enjoyed the side vegetables and would've liked to have more! The udon was in a tasty simple broth and was on the soft side. I would've preferred it to be cooked a little less for a springier texture but still enjoyed it. Overall, the meal was delicious and quite filling.The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was very pleasant, and our waitress was really nice and checked in on us a few times! We had a lovely time, and I'd recommend Soba-ya for a nice lunch.",0
"Note - they will not seat you until your whole party has arrived. They are on the third floor of their building and I strongly suggest taking the steps as the elevator is pretty slow. This place was great! Part of our family was planning on doing the Empire State Building later in the evening and we're happy to meet up somewhere close by. When we were seated the hostess mentioned that our table would be required to order at least two appetizers or entrees. I told her that certainly wouldn't be he's for our foodie clan. But it's worth mentioning if you prefer to just sit and drink. Hubby and I had the fries and the bulgogi quesadilla, both of which were awesome! The fries were regular cut with a crunchy, well-seasoned exterior. I was warned that their spicy Mayo was actually pretty spicy, so I didn't use that myself. The quesadilla was everything I needed - toasted exterior. Inside filled with plenty of meat and cheese!I tried one of my sister in-laws's dumplings. While all the flavor only came from the sauce, the crispy exterior and soft inside was nice. My husband tried his brother's glass noodles and said they were awesome!Service was fast! We will definitely return! I'm hoping that next time we can get a table on their enclosed balcony!!",0
"I haven't dined in-person at Ollie's, so this review will only be in the context of my delivery/take-out experience.Ollie's is a decent place for Chinese place in this area. The prices are reasonable and the lunch specials are especially good since the items are only around $10 each. Some of the other reviewers have said that the portion sizes are generous, but I think ""fair"" is a better description imo.I've had their Sesame Chicken Lunch Special, Pineapple Fried Rice w/ Shrimp, Egg Drop Soup, Shrimp Spring Rolls, and Egg Roll so far.My personal favorite is the Pineapple Fried Rice which is flavorful and not excessively greasy. The Sesame Chicken was good as well, but the sauce was a personally a tad sweet for my taste. The Egg Drop Soup was slightly saltier than what I've had at other places, but I actually enjoyed the additional seasoning. The Shrimp Spring Rolls are super crispy and filled with large pieces of shrimp.Overall, Ollie's provides tasty Chinese food at reasonable prices. Would recommend!",0
"Gnocco is a great spot for brunch, especially if you're looking for a place to sit outside. The service was a bit lackluster, but the food was definitely worth it. I especially enjoyed the cappuccino and the burrata sandwich. My friends also enjoyed their avocado toast and gnocchi. My sister really liked the wheat pasta with arugula. Overall, a great spot for a casual brunch.",1
"TLDR: I've had quite a lot of Thai food in NYC and Valla still stands out! A new favorite of mine. Can't wait to try something new next time.Came here with a small group of friends. We ordered a bowl of tom kha to start, the fried fish special they were offering that day, crab dumpling curry, red curry, and pad see ew. Everything was delicious and each dish was plated so well. My personal favorite was the fried fish. It was a whole fried fish with a sweet garlic sauce. The fish was sectioned so that there was no effort when removing it from the bone. Crab curry was also good. I hadn't had dumplings in a curry before so it was quite interesting to me. I appreciated that the tom kha wasn't served with the galangal or lemongrass in the bowl so it was easier to eat. Red curry and pad se ew were also great. I think if I were to gripe with something it would be the Thai iced tea and coffee. Both were too sweet for us! A couple of our orders were lunch specials. I will say that the starters for the specials were on the smaller side. Service was quick and attentive and we felt safe in terms of covid. Can't wait to come again!",0
"I think Rubieosa is overrated. The pizza is decent but not mind blowing in any way. I will say their mozzarella sticks are the gooeist and most delicious ones that I have ever had, but everything else was underwhelming. Outside of that, their artichoke appetizer was very unappetizing and was more like a soggy soup. The wait is usually long. I think there are better places in little Italy to go to if you are in the neighborhood.",1
"I had a great time at Tacombi! The outside seating is a great way to enjoy the hot weather, and the staff was very attentive. The food was great, and the prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I found a new lunch spot! Market Crates. Forget about Just Salad or Chop't. This little gem delivers first class service without the assembly line wait.Tucked in the middle of the block on 35th Street, Market Crates has much to offer. Different stations for different cravings: soups, sandwiches, salads and more.As soon as you enter, it not only smells good but is immaculate. I keep reading about their delicious coffee which I'll definitely have to try.On this first time visit, I was in the mood for salad. Pick your greens. Then protein (shrimp is additional $2.50). Select 3 premium ingredients. Finally, 6 additional toppings--that's 10 toppings in all, for a total of $14.14.The staff is super nice. There is a great variety of delicious, fresh lunch selections and the prices are reasonable. I read they also serve breakfast.Sweet.",0
"The Málà Project is a restaurant that I would not necessarily return for dinner, but it is a great spot for lunch. The menu is cheaper, and the restaurant is large enough that it can accommodate large groups. I finally tried the Málà Project with a friend last night, and it was definitely busy and bustling with the Midtown office post-work crowd.

We followed the recommended amount (8-10 items for dry hotpot) and stuck with ""mild"" heat level (spicy enough where you feel a teensy after burn, but not enough to make you reach for your water). We also ordered the Turnip with Jellyfish appetizer (very yummy and quite fairly priced at $8) and a bowl of rice each. The amount was perfect for two girls with big appetites and came out to about $60 including tip and tax.

The main attraction is obviously the málà hotpot. The flavor was good, although I wasn't crazy about the portion sizes of each ingredient. We ordered beef tenderloin, pork belly, fish balls, tofu skin, and several veggies, but the difference in volume of each item was comically staggering. For one $4 order, I probably",1
"nice cozy rooftop in the roger smith hotel. just had a few drinks here but seems pretty chill. it was already packed when we got there, but the wait staff was nice and let us know when a table freed up! not much of a view, but it gets you outside. would recommend.",0
"I had a really great experience at this restaurant! The service was excellent and the atmosphere was really cozy and relaxing. The outdoor seating was a bit small but it was cute, and the portion was surprisingly big! I was even too full for desserts afterwards and that almost never happens, so I think my favorite might have been the octopus which was the special appetizer of the day. Chewy and juicy and went well with the seasoning plus a bit of lemon! Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Came here for dinner for the first time last night and it exceeded expectations! first, it was a very cozy environment inside - perfect for a romantic date night when it is cold and snowy outside. Tables are spaced out making it very safe during the pandemic. Second, our waitress was super friendly and suggested we order less food than we originally requested because the portions are generous. I really appreciated her comment and immediately caught my attention as one of the most genuinely sincere people! Third, their wine and food were very good!We will be coming back with friends very soon!",0
"Came here on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty packed throughout the night. The Favs--Fried Tiger Prawn with Salted Egg Yolk Plate:  maybe I have a personal thing for egg yolk flavor dishes, very tasty in my opinion and the shrimp was fat and juicy. Mouth Watering Boneless Chicken Thigh Plate: flavorful and tender chicken thigh, expected to be a little spicier but pretty satisfying. Stir-fried Shredded Cabbage Plate: cooked with right timing and great flavor, slightly heavier on the sauce.The okayed--Dan Dan Noodle: not bad try and noodle texture was great but it was very dry. I ended up eat it with the sauce from Mouth Watering Chicken. Minced Pork over Rice: in general very good and very generous on the toppings, it would be perfect if less water in the minced pork sauce so it's more flavorful. The meh... Fried Peppercorn Pork Belly Plate: our least favorite, too fried food couldn't taste the pork.... Service was friendly and attentive, but maybe something wrong with their system that we were getting each dish like twice, and I saw our food was sent to other table several times as well. Nice addition in the neighborhood though!",0
"I visited this restaurant yesterday and was really impressed! Everything we ordered was delicious and nothing was overly salty, spicy, or undercooked. The wait wasn't too long for dinner time and everything was served up pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food.",1
"I had a really great time at Jue Lan restaurant! The atmosphere was really cool and the service was excellent. The food was also really good - I especially loved the ox boa and lobster fried rice. Overall, I was really happy with my experience and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"I came here today and I must say it was very good. I am usually in the area. We drove by and was very intrigued by it. It looks really nice and I must say I am glad I went. I had the sui mai and I must say it was the right size and a good amount of filling. I really enjoyed it. It was very flavorful, I did not even use a dipping sauce. I also had the shrimp roll but that was not as good. There was nothing wrong with it but I did not enjoy it. I think the wrapping of it was a bit off. I also got the hibiscus tea which was good and tasted like hibiscus. I would definitely come back. I like that you have options for food in this area and they also have combos. They also give you a timer so when your food is ready it rings. I like that a lot and the inside is pretty. I would say this is a perfect place for a lunch date.",0
"I've been dying to go back to Jacob's Pickles since our first experience there. My boyfriend and I were over the moon with our huge portions, delightful waiter, delicious drinks, and finger-licking-good comfort food.We initially were going to walk straight past this place. Then I saw the biscuits. Then I checked my Yelp bookmarks. Yep. JP was on the list.We were quickly seated and met by our cheery waiter, who was very helpful in choosing drinks. He was friendly without seeming inauthentic and had a general enthusiasm for the restaurant and their offerings.We ordered the biscuits with all the fixins as a starter. The biscuits themselves are really good, but the homemade strawberry jam and maple butter put them over the top. I wish the fixins weren't served in disposable paper condiment cups; firstly because they're not reusable, but also because scraping jam, butter, and honey out of soggy paper cups is not easy or fun.The chicken and pancakes were so delicious. Two chicken breasts, two humongous pancakes, and lots of bacon crumbles and syrup. I took a whole breast and pancake home for later, even after sharing a sizeable chunk with my boyfriend. This is a massive dish.My boyfriend ordered the buffalo mac n cheese, and when I say I was jealous, I mean I've never been closer to punching someone out for their food. Again, massive portion. He couldn't finish it all. When it was time to heat up the leftovers, it was so hard for me to relinquish them to him instead of horking them secretly. If you love cheese, this is the dish for you.For my drink, I had the Jam Jar, which our waiter recommended. It's made with house-made strawberry jam and fresh-squeezed lemonade and is a dream of a cocktail on a hot summer day.We'll definitely head back to JP. I need the mac n cheese.",0
"I just don't understand why by Chloe is so popular. For one, the service is atrocious: they're unfriendly, cold, and impatient. If it's one thing I hate, it's when professionals make you feel like you're annoying them with your questions and requests, and that rings true for this business. Second, their food is not satisfying. I got their guac burger and some blueberry smoothie. The burger was sloppy, bare, and plasticky. It hardly had anything in it to justify the price. The smoothie was so watery that I could tell it was mainly ice. I was so disappointed. I then got a drip coffee, but that was also watery and lower in quality than Dunkin' Donuts. I left so confused. The place is cute and clean, but that's all they have to offer. I'd been to the Flatiron location and I really wanted to give them another chance, but I'm so done with Chloe, whoever she is.",0
"I'm so glad I finally had the chance to check out this restaurant! It's always so busy, and I can see why - the food is really good. The prices are a bit high, but I guess that's to be expected in a place like this. The portions are definitely on the smaller side, but that's to be expected given the high prices. The service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected in a place like this. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
The portions here are good sized for the main course and most of the appetizers. After sharing appetizers with a group I wasn't able to finish my meal. The main dishes mostly consist of noodle dishes but there is a large variety of appetizers and the drinks are pretty good too. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff are friendly. I would recommend this restaurant for a casual night out.,1
"We found this place through one of their sister Restaurants that we love, Izakaya Mew. For Valentine's Day we couldn't find a reservation anywhere, luckily when I called, Nonono saved the day and said they would fit us in. Thought we were going to be placed at the bar, but they sat us at a nice table upstairs. Starting off with cocktails, we ordered seasonal drinks. Honestly this place knows how to make a drink! Everything we had was balanced and tasty. My friend went with the Rose cocktail (pink gin, gin, rose, raspberry and lime juice) and I got a Zakuro (vodka, grapefruit vodka, lime juice, pomegranate. Since this place is known for skewers so we ordered a few to try. The chicken breast with scallion (our favorite!), lime cilantro chicken thigh (good, not amazing) and the short rib with onion (my short rib was more fatty then meaty). You should 100% order the Hamachi. This was the best dish of the night. The fish was so fresh, the sauce was just citrusy enough and the different toppings (fried garlic, cucumbers, mandarin slices and greens) made it the perfect bite. Would come back for this alone. We also got the Nonono roll, tuna with avocado  basically, that was really good and the Soba Meshi. Amazing noodle dish, the egg was a little over done but the noodles were good enough to stand alone. Finished with the Kuro Goma (black sesame panna cotta). This won't be for everyone, it isn't that sweet think more semi-sweet, but it has a great black sesame taste and feels like an authentic Japanese dessert. I absolutely devoured it. Everything here is shareable, meant to be eaten in a tapas style.",0
"Stopped here for a late night beer. We had already eaten, so we were not interested in their food although the menu was interesting. The food being served to other customers looked and smelled delicious. As the name suggests their beer and food is German. I had glasses of Spaten Oktoberfest and Schöfferhofer Grapefruit Hefeweizen. The Oktoberfest was good. The grapefruit was obvious with the Hefeweizen. It was low in alcohol and almost tasted like grapefruit juice.",0
"Even though the restaurant seemed pretty staffed and with just a few customers, they still managed to not be around when needed.The bite for afternoon tea were not fresh and comparably small to other locations.",0
"Came for brunch after not having been for a couple of years. Looks like everything has had a revamp, and the brunch menu was very reasonable priced. We had the croque monsieur, scrambled eggs, hangover cure and French toast. Everyone happy, good stuff, and we sat in the semi-outside section. They have added a large new outdoors section under a tent next to a big synagogue, seems like they can seat a lot of people.",0
"Lucky Cat is a solid go-to late-night spot among spots that tend to close pretty early around this area. As of this review, I've taken out once and ate-in about three times. Their ramen broth is delicious, so I would recommend getting any of their ramen. Check out the specials if you're feeling fancy--they also have a truffle ramen which is loaded with truffle oil umami and a small bit of truffle pieces. I also dig their sushi--the chirashi bowl was beautifully presented and the fish was very fresh, albeit a bit on the smaller side. The ambience of the place makes it perfect for meeting a friend for dinner or going out for a date. The lighting is low, it always seems packed and lively, and it is thoughtfully decorated with Japanese posters and a massive beckoning cat in the back of the room. Just be patient with service though since the waiters/waitresses and bartender seem to be constantly busy and running around the room, and could use an extra hand.Overall, solid place for ramen, sushi, drinks that is always busy. Good for smaller crowds if you don't want a wait time. Would recommend, and it's a go-to spot to meet up with friends.",0
"No frills, simple place on 1st AVE with an easy menu and variety of options. The owner, Joseph, is friendly and offers trustworthy opinions about what food is good versus average on their menu. Only a stone throw away from Cornell hospital, making it a great place to grab an easy bite and many hospital workers are seen coming in-and-put of here with takeout orders.I are the specialty salad with special chicken, side of eggplant and cucumbers/tomatoes drizzled in garlic dressing. The salad was good though not special- well contained for takeout but an overall small portion size. The dressing was certainly present but not easily spread across the entire salad, making it just satisfactory at best, even though it was well spiced. Perhaps I'm being too picky but the side pita was also not heated and cut into small slices. Overall, I would return for a simple bite out but with so much present on this block of restaurants alone, would suggest trying other places before settling here.",0
"I've been recommending this place to everyone since I dined here--there are very few other places that can beat Pado in terms of quality/taste per dollar (within the $$-$$$ range). For about $50pp, you can get a filling meal of delicious apps, inventive rolls, and a few pieces of omakase-quality nigiri. Definitely take advantage of happy hour (til 7pm on weekdays, if I'm not mistaken), which also has $8 appetizers on top of discounted drinks.For apps, I got the avocado bomb (spicy tuna or salmon covered with avocado slices, served with taro chips), orange blossom (lightly seared salmon topped with ikura), crispy rice topped with spicy tuna, and bang bang shrimp (spin on shrimp tempura) -- all of them were solid (and only $8). We also got uni (Santa Barbara, extremely fresh) and fatty toro nigiri (literally looked like bacon), and then two rolls to share for 3. The Hamachiba was my favorite (yellowtail, jalapeno, and shisho), but the Playbada (which was smoked at your table) was also really delicious!Definitely check-in on Yelp for a free ice cream to end the meal. Ambience and service are both also awesome - really don't have any critique (but fingers cross it doesn't get TOO popular).",0
"Chicken Insider is the best Korean fried chicken place that I've been to in NYC--and ironically, it is on the Upper East Side. The chicken is always juicy and fresh, unlike the quality of other chicken places where it feels like it's been left out in the open and re-fried when ordered. The batter is also incredibly crispy, without being greasy or heavy. The side dishes pictured are not included with the chicken, but you can order the white Pickled Radish on the side. Highly recommend if you are in the area and craving Korean fried chicken!",1
"had  a  perfect girls night out  after checking out a local gallery and some random shopping we ventured off to find a weekend happy hour and I'm sooo glad to have found Verlaine. Honestly this place was super sexy in decor . We arrived thinking happy hour was over at 7pm so we quickly placed an order for lychee martinis,  five spiced calamari, garlic wings, hot chips, and coconut curry shrimp.  The  lychee martinis were amazing!!!the food had potential, but my god I think I had to pour a bottle of salt to every dish, thank good each dish was accompanied by a dipping sauce because it gave the dish some flavor. After our first round of drinks we realized  the happy hour ended at 10pm, this was a complete game changer !!!  We ordered red sangrias, gin and tonics and. Some more lychee Martinis. The red sangrias were bomb, every drink literally had just the right amount of alcohol. Our server she was great but sad to say I couldn't remember her name from the amount of alcohol consumed but she was a doll. I will definitely be back for another girls night out.",0
"I've been to other locations of The Smith numerous times, however this was my first time at the East Village location. We knew going for brunch that it was a limited menu due to the kitchen fire they've had recently.We had 10am reservations for Sunday brunch and we were the fourth group of guests seated. Surprisingly, it took about 10 minutes for a server to come over, which I understand they just opened so they are getting their bearings together. However, it seemed many people who were seated after us were tended to much quicker. Water and sparkling water were on the table. They eventually did bring us bread with butter. For brunch, we ordered the French Toast and the Johnny Eggs Benedict, with a side of waffle fries. We were kinda disappointed with the whole meal to be honest. Like I've said, I've been to The Smith to eat a couple of times, and each time was great. This time was just off. The cornbread on the Eggs Benedict just seemed like it was made prior and it didn't have that freshness/it was kinda dry. I wish the greens they served with it were somewhat dressed in a vinaigrette instead of being just washed greens.  The French toast was tasty, but the middle of a piece or two seemed a little to undercooked to our liking. The waffle fries were room temperature and just okay. I really do like The Smith, but I am not sure I would go back for brunch.",0
"Their sign had me wondering about the ""difference that fresh makes..."" and now I know--I would return for a tasteful, spicy meal! Loved that it didn't taste greasy or make me feel bloated afterwards.We had the chicken tikka masala and kadai paneer, which came with rice. We also got an order of garlic naan and shared a mango lassi--way more than enough food for the three of us.The service was also very attentive. I would recommend Ashoka to anyone in the area!",0
"Went expecting the best thin crust pizza of my life, and felt like it was good but fairly on par with a Sbarro slice of pizza I could order at my local mall food court. It was delicious as most pizza is, yet it didn't stand out to be as being exceptional.I ordered a slice of cheese pizza. I loved the cheese, and the crust was truly the thinnest crust I have seen on a pizza. I have seen some reviews saying they take card for a certain minimum, I ordered 3 slices which came out to $9 and was asked for cash only still. They have an ATM right outside the door if you don't have any cash. Overall, the location is small and doesn't have much seating which I think is fairly standard for a NY food place.",0
"We had a great time at the restaurant! Everything was delicious and we had a lot of fun chatting with our fellow diners. We both ordered the create your own four ways, and the dishes were all really good. The only downside was that there wasn't a lot of corncake in the dish, which was a bit disappointing. All in all, though, we had a great time and would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"The restaurant is quite nice and has a great vibe. The waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have. The food quality is alright - I think many bad reviews are about mornings and brunch which I haven't yet to try and it looks okay but not my go to? However, the evening menu is quite nice. The portions are quite small when you see it, but it's actually a perfect size for an Italian restaurant. The drinks are nice, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. The red wine (barbera was fine but not the best I've had, the white star is decent. My friend had their lemonade and tea. Quite a few tables and usually not too busy on a weekday, not sure if it's any different on the weekends though. The linguini & clams were tasty and the clams are big so it's nice but it's a little bit too salty for my liking. I like the texture of the pasta but I just wish it's a bit less heavy. The lamb radiatore was amazing, sauce is a bit on the sour acidic side but it's not too strong. The shredded lamb wasn't dry and the pasta was perfectly cooked. The desserts were pretty",1
"Service was great but food was okay. The pickled eggs was just boiled eggs with pickle juice. Wasnt sure if it was worth $7... The blueberry biscuits werent toasted as much as we were hoping, more texture wouldve been nice. The different jams and butters were great though. The ham and cheese biscuit sandwich was pretty good but definitely not worth $14, overall it wasn't the best experience but it was okay.",0
"I walked over here from Times Square for lunch, and it was really good! The interior is beautifully decorated with both indoor and outdoor seating. The hostess greeted me immediately and helped me with my order. I had my favorite chicken pad thai - I love that they used raw bean sprouts as the veggie in this dish, along with crushed peanut garnish. The noodles were cooked perfectly!",0
"Currently holding top spot in my under $100 omakase category, the team at Korami puts on an excellent show. The 15 course menu has all items you'd expect to see at most places with a few seasonal rotations in play. I consider the style traditional-leaning, they don't put crazy things on top of your fish for shock value (the a-la-carte bonus items are the exception if you want to indulge) but their focus is on great fish quality and excellent, consistent execution (this has become a reg spot for my friends). It's a small and (good noisy) with quick turnover of seats so you'll be done in 60 mins for the next seating to takeover. Def worth a visit for great omakase that won't break the bank.Comparables: Shinn East, 13 Water, Sushi BlossomsFood: 9/10Value: 10/10Service: 8/10Atmosphere: 8/10 (for small, lively counter experience)",0
"The Alvin is a great place to grab a few drinks with friends. There is a variety of seating both indoors and outdoors. I love the ambiance here! They have a great music selection and a quiet bar area where you can have a conversation. I only came here for drinks, however, the food menu also looks good and I plan to return. Good draft beer selection, a tasty cocktail menu, and friendly bartenders. I love a good pub and I plan on coming back here. Highly recommend this place!",1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. I tried the birria tacos and they were really good. I also tried the breakfast burrito which was really good. The skinny taco salad was a traditional taco bowl but it had some great sauces too. I would definitely come back here for lunch and try some of the other dishes.,1
"I was hesitant to go to Jacques given the mixed reviews, but my friend made reservations and I'm glad I went. The brunch was delicious - I ordered the steak sandwich which was served with a small side of salad and fries. I ate half and took the rest to go. Definitely recommend you try out this spot if you're on the fence.",1
"I have ordered the vermicelli bowl with pork several times and it's delicious and fresh every time! The pork is really flavorful. This is a solid place! Since it is made fresh, consider calling ahead to save time if picking up. The inside is charming and quiet with lots of great indoor plants.",0
"I had a disappointing experience at Xian, my go-to spot for Asian-style noodles in midtown. I arrived late in the day, so I shouldn't have been too surprised when my go-to order, liang pi noodles, were sold out. I ended up ordering the vegetable hand pulled noodles instead. Unfortunately, my order was full of spicy Sichuan hot pepper bits. I took it back and watched as they put my order in a sieve, rinsed it with water, and then inelegantly dumped some soy sauce on top. As you could imagine, there were still hot pepper bits so the order was still spicy. In addition, it was oversalted, and I drank 3 bottles of water during the night because I was so thirsty from the meal. Even if my order has been correct, the vegetables the noodles came with were pretty abysmal. Who serves pieces of potato in an Asian noodle dish?? Other than the wood ear mushrooms and tofu, none of the vegetables were authentically Asian. The one shining bit of this trip was the hand pulled noodles, which were deliciously and freshly pulled as I waited. But I would've rather eaten the noodles plain than have eaten that oversalted sauce. I'm",1
"I wasn't very impressed with this spot, which was kind of disappointing as I was looking forward to it. The interior was really nice and I loved the decor. That was about all I liked about this spot. The food was decent but not worth the price. The fries were adequate and the calamari average. The chicken marsala was a bit undercooked and the flavor wasn't as rich as other chicken marsalas I've had. The most disappointing part was the tea selection, or lack of. They had the standard tea selection (earl grey, chamomile, peppermint) but not a very expansive tea menu despite the restaurant offering high tea (at the Times Square location). I ordered peppermint and was given a pot of Celestial peppermint, the exact brand I get at work for free...Overall, it was a cute spot but that was about it. The food was average and not worth the price.",1
"I absolutely enjoyed my visit to this restaurant! The atmosphere is really nice and the food was amazing. I especially loved the chicken and lamb Adana's. The meats were so well seasoned and the portion size was really good. The rice was also really good, and it had a really nice, aromatic flavor. The sour cabbage and onions added a nice texture to the dish. The bread that they served was also really good, and it was very fresh. The only downside to the meal was the salad. It was rather bland and not very interesting to me. However, the striped bass that came with the salad was definitely the star of the show. It was cooked very delicately and had a lot of flavor. The only downside to the fish was that there were a lot of bones in it, which can be a potential choking hazard. However, overall I had a really great experience at this restaurant, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1
"Returned in mid-March for dinner. Was excited to try Dame as a full-fledged restaurant, and the hype is definitely earned. Got a reservation exactly one month ahead (slots open at noon daily on Resy). I tried:+ Proper Pimm's cup + Gin and tonic + Grilled oysters with green chartreuse hollandaise+ Smoked whitefish croquettes + Squid and scallion skewers+ Tuna tartare and bottarga on toast+ Grilled cabbage with mussels and black truffle+ Fish and chips+ Meyer lemon curd tart+ Sticky toffee pudding They know what they're doing with seafood here. My favorite dish was hands down the mussels and cabbage - a winning combo that I would never have dreamed could work so well. Second place was a tie that went to the tuna tartare and squid skewers, followed by the sticky toffee pudding.Only thing I would skip next time are the croquettes; they were a little salty and just paled in comparison to the other amazing dishes. Also, DO NOT SKIP THE GRILLED OYSTERS.",0
"Justino's Pizzeria is a great place to go for a cheap slice in the city. They have tons of options to choose from, and the slices are big and crispy. I recommend the bacon chicken ranch slice.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised about Ricardo Steakhouse. The vibes are great, reasonable prices, helpful staff and amazing food. The portions are very generous for what you're paying and I must say, they're good at everything they make. Drinks were good and definitely did the trick. I will be returning for sure.",1
"I had a great time at this Pelicana restaurant! The chicken was perfectly crispy and the sauce was tasty, and the fries are delicious. It's a bit hard to find, but well worth it once you get in. The location is also really cool, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I had a great time at this sushi restaurant! The food was great, the service was wonderful, and the atmosphere was perfect. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great dining experience.",1
"Burger was great but kinda greasy, and didn't completely live up to the hype. Steak could've been better, was a little dry.",0
"Sensational Restaurant to Brunch !!!  After Halloween night we needed some comfort food! we drank too much and we needed fuel to our bodies. We found this place on yelp . Surprisingly  no lines, the table was wait for us. Jay was our server!!!!!! what a girl !!! she was great!! kudos to her ! she made our Brunch spectacular !!!   After we scanned the menu, remember , almost all restaurant in NYC are using this method, we starting to order. Drink the Rainbow and Lime Margaritas was our first order, yeap , more alcohol LOL..Drink the Rainbow ! 10 of 10!! awesome drink !!! very sweet and they use skittles to make this drink! you cant go wrong with this drink! Lime Margarita- 4 of 5 , too mucho lime for me, but it was good. Botanical Mojito = 5 of 5 !! great taste, is a sweet drink ! Food!Chicken and bacon waffles - so tasting ! !they used a honey sauce! wow! amazing! the chicken was crispy ! Tex Benedict - was perfectly made, kudos to the chefMom's Burger -  it you into burger you would love this one !! You can add any ingredients ! The place was very clean, they sanitized all tables and they servers are using face mask !Please ask for Jay to be your server !! you will have a wonderful time with her and her craziness ! great girl !!! Extremely recommended !!!",0
"Jacob's Pickles is a great restaurant with delicious food. I ordered the honey chicken and pickles sandwich and it was really good. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and there were lots of sweet pickles which I loved. The only downside was that it came with biscuits and it was way too much, so I felt very wasteful not being able to finish it. The mushroom gravy smothered chicken was also amazing, and it didn't skimp out on the mushroom or gravy. The sandwiches came with grits which I'm not a fan of, but they could substitute with another side. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Jacob's Pickles and I'm definitely going back when I'm in the area again!",1
Havana Central is a must-go restaurant if you're in Times Square! The food is absolutely amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. I can't recommend it enough!,1
"Very crowded on a Saturday night. It is very loud, so if your looking for a quiet place don't come here. The waitress was new on the job for approximately 2 weeks. She was attentive at all. She got the drink order wrong, and the food took forever to come. The ribs were average, not seasoned enough. Overall the place is very average, and I wasn't impressed.",0
"I stumbled upon this place in Chelsea a couple months ago. It's small, intimate and cute and has a warm and welcoming vibe to it. I was here for lunch, so I got a classes tomato and basil penne and I was super happy with it. They serve complimentary bread which to me is an essential with every italian meal, and they also keep a pot of parmesan on each table! I can't wait to be back here for dinner and try out more items from their menu. - Navya J@nyconthetable",0
"51B Canal Street is a great spot for Southeast Asian eats, with Perfect Taste taking over Kopitiam's original location with its Singaporean food and drinks. The owner is a really friendly and chatty guy, and the dining area is a tight squeeze, but you won't be worrying about that while eating what's on offer.

When we first stopped in, the owner told us they'd run out of chicken. This time around, we made sure to call and reserve the dishes in advance. The Hainanese chicken was mediocre, but the sauces were a bit underwhelming. The scallion sauce and thick soy sauce were pretty good, but I expected more. The chicken laksa was delicious, though. This comforting bowl of noodles and spicy coconut milk broth was topped with perfectly tender chicken, fish cake slices, vegetables, and fried tofu. I'd definitely return for another bowl.

We finished off with kaya jam and butter toast, which is the most traditional pairing, but you can also get the kaya jam toast with cheese or peanut butter instead. What a great simple and sweet treat to finish off the meal.",1
"Nice - newish? - spot in Hell's Kitchen.  It was a sleepy Wednesday night, but tables began to fill in around 8p. Sat at the bar for happy hour, tried the red sangria ($8 at HH prices) after being assured it was not too sweet. It had a decent taste, although too much ice and a smallish glass; ordered another.We had three happy hour priced apps, $8 each, and they were quite tasty and nicely plated. Patatas bravas was yummy, it almost always is, with a nice sauce but only six potato wedges. The croquetas de jamon y queso were small but had a good taste profile, artfully plated, and four to an order. Pan con tomate was fine, I liked the bread and tomatoes but a bit too much manchego cheese on top.Friendly bartender and manager, Latin soundtrack (viva Colombia! J.Balvin and Shakira). Nice bar and dining room design. What could they do better? Two things. It is a bit low energy, but perhaps that is not all bad. Also, prior to the 7p end of happy hour, the bartender should come over to allow us to order another round. Overall, a pleasant spot on 10th Avenue in the high 40s.",0
"Korean joints are plentiful in the 30s in NYC.  Tried this one by chance. Nice atmosphere. Spotlessly clean of course. Quick service. Watch for the upsell.  My daughter, her friend and I ordered. Waiter suggested BBQ for two with banchan set  instead of one plus some dumpling  apps.  It was plenty. Friend doesn't eat meat but he didn't know that. Lunch menu was offered at a good price.  In a sea of Korean restaurants this one was very good.",0
"Two friends RAVED about Uncle Boon's to me, so I had to go. I was sadly very full when I arrived at 5:30pm on a Friday night, but at least we beat the rush! One of our friends wasn't ready, so we actually had to go back at 6pm; they don't seat you unless the whole party is there. There wasn't a wait then either, but when my other friends tried to come later that night, there was a 2 hour wait. So come early! Among the three of us, we ordered the green mango salad, the chicken salad, the cabbage and the bone marrow (mine!). My friend had ordered the cabbage based on someone's review that it was ""the best thing they had ever eaten"" and we were pretty confused (and very sad for this person). It was the only blip in our meal; the other three dishes killed it. The food all came out surprisingly quickly; we pored over the menu agonizingly, ordered, ate our food and paid our check all in 45 min without feeling rushed at all. It's a well-decorated restaurant, but I do have a pet peeve with super dark restaurants because I have to strain to read the menu and my food pictures come out terribly. :( Even these two tiny things though can't stop me from giving Uncle Boon's 5 stars and wanting to come back ASAP with all my friends, though.",0
"I've finally come for dinner and wow, their food is sublime! Brunch to me is good, but not something I have to return for, but their dinner is a yes! Sign me up! I'd like to return ASAP! Service is as always, friendly and attentive. But let's get to the important part...the food!! Croquettes: these are good but I could skip. They're made well and very cheesy, but just not my cup of tea. Braised beef cheeks: holy moly out of this world. The portion is good and the beef is so tender! I was unbelievably happy. I loved the polenta and mushrooms that it came with. Would definitely order again. Whole branzino: my friend liked this. I didn't try it, but it seemed good. Cacio e pepe: delicious!! It's very cheesy and creamy, but in the best ways possible. And that's quite a compliment since normally I don't like cacio e pepe because inherently it's always too creamy for my preference. But they somehow found a balance of creamy cheese goodness that didn't overwhelm me. The pasta is definitely cooked Al dente (as it should be!), so if you're not a fans of that, you'll probably claim this pasta is undercooked.",0
"I had the pleasure of dining at this ramen restaurant and I must say that I was extremely impressed. The broth was rich and flavorful, not too salty, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I also really enjoyed the soft boiled egg in the broth. The only downside to this restaurant is that the wait is quite long, but it's definitely worth it!",1
"Came here as I was craving some lobster roll one day and this was down the block from where I live. I got the Connecticut Roll, which I found was the most ordered here on Yelp. It's a decent sandwich at a hefty price of $17. Was expecting more lobster meat than what I received. Finished the sandwich pretty quickly. I also got a side order of tots, which helped me fill up. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the tots a lot more. Will come back to try the other items on the menu.",0
"Overall, I had a good experience at Barn Joo. The food was good, the service was great and the atmosphere was perfect for a casual night out with friends. However, I didn't enjoy the Korean food as much as the soy garlic wings and truffle fries. The seafood pancake was also a bit disappointing. Overall, I would definitely recommend Barn Joo to others!",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent. The standout dish for me was the Shanghai pan fried bun, which was still very good. However, I was disappointed with a few of the items - the spicy minced meat noodle in particular was over-mixed with corn starch, making it difficult to eat. The cold platter also wasn't very good, with the jellyfish being particularly disappointing. The hot and sour soup was also a bit of a let-down, being too thick and sweet. Overall, though, I thought the food was decent and I would definitely come back.",1
"We. Loved. Suki. Recommended by a friend, this one's been on the list for a while and am so excited to report that it did not disappoint!Am no expert on authentic Japanese cuisine, but I thought this spot was great. The curry katsu was yummy -- got the pork and chicken. Have had juicier versions of pork katsu, but the curry really pulled it together. The real star of the night though was the beef udon -- holy cow. Literally the cow must have been blessed bc this was a soul warming, perfectly spiced (level 4), mouth watering bowl of udon. Again, no expert, but thought this was one of one of my favorite bowls of udon so far in the city. It was the kind of noodle soup that transported you emotionally and mentally into grandma's kitchen.Also the side salad - LOVED. Don't sleep on it -- it has a peanut kick to your typical ginger dressing salad.All this with great service and such a casual, no frills atmosphere -- can't wait to take friends back here!FAVORITE ORDERS: Beef UdonFood: 4/5Service/Speed: 5/5Price (college student budget): $$Ambiance: Casual, lots of seating inside.Would return & recommend? 5/5",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The whipped cream-based hot chocolate was amazing, and I loved that it was so thick! It was like drinking hot chocolate pudding. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great warm drink on a cold day.",1
"Overall, I had a good experience at Spoonfed NYC. The shrimp and grits were delicious, as was the okra and molasses corn bread. The only downside was the long wait for the food. If they could address the hunger issue, I would have given this restaurant a 4-star rating.",1
"I was highly disappointed with my meal from this restaurant. I ordered the 3 tacos which was the blackened fish, fried chicken & pork belly. I also ordered the street Corn Pops, churro donuts & pico de gallo. The blacked fish & pork belly taco was ok, but it just felt like something was missing. The fried chicken taco I couldn't even eat. The piece of ""chicken"" was barely a piece of chicken. The churro donuts sounded promising, but it had a rough texture & DEFINITELY tasted nothing like churros. The only thing that was good was the pico de gallo & street Corn Pops.",1
"I got takeout from here tonight for the first time and had a pretty great meal! First off, the delivery was SO fast. Definitely a huge plus! I got the fish tacos, chips, guac, and rice/beans. There was hits and misses. I loved the homemade chips and felt like you got a lot of chips! The side of guac was super tasty, but small. I felt like it was really overpriced at $4 for the size of the guac. It should have been 1.50/2. Next time, I would definitely get the large. I loved the flaky fish in the fish tacos, but I felt like they were lacking a bit of flavor. The slaw had no dressing and there was so much of it. I think if it had some acid, it would have made the taco better. The fish was cooked perfectly though and I loved the homemade corn tortilla. The rice and beans were very bland. I was wishing I had gone with my initial instinct and tried the Mexican street corn instead. I'll be trying it next time!Overall, this was solid Mexican food and super efficient delivery. The nachos look amazing, so I want to try those next time!",0
"I stopped by this restaurant after shopping with a friend and was seated right away. The pasta wasn't even cooked, it tasted uncooked. The dish I ordered, the pappardelle with truffle, was ok. However, I opted to try another dish- the rigatoni with tomato sauce and burrata. This dish tasted much better and was much more flavorful. I couldn't order the LPB burger because it had beef and bacon, which I don't eat. The staff was nice, but nothing special. I'd say this place is trying, but I won't be back because there are better Italian restaurants in the area.",1
"Our family has come to this restaurant pretty much every time we come to New York City. It is a little hard to find as it is in the basement and is accessible by going down a tight flight of stairs. However, once you get down the stairs he will be treated by a blast of the delicious smells of authentic Chinese food.The portions are massive and it is very easy to over order! The good news is you can certainly box it up and take it with you. There isn't a whole lot of seating in the restaurant and unless you get there at an off hour you are likely going to be waiting in line to get in. It is well worth it! The food is delicious and the staff is always extraordinarily friendly. They also always have really cool T-shirts for 10 bucks!The menu is extensive and I would challenge you to go off of the beaten path and look at foods that you might not normally have access to at your local Chinese restaurant. This place is a real treat!",0
"The Warren is a great place to go for a date. The outdoor seating is perfect for people-watching, and the cocktails are delicious. The only downside is that the food didn't really wow us, but the charcuterie plate is a must-try.",1
"Decent bowl of noodles, but nothing remarkably different from other noodle places in the area. Ordered #33, good wontons, average dumplings, tasty soup.Service was okay and the place was clean. Not a super busy place since it's not located on any of the main roads frequented by tourists.",0
"Very impressive rooftop decorThe omakase counter looks like the typical sushi counter but is far from your upscale countertopsOnce seated, you will notice the counter is pretty sticky ( we requested that the counter be wiped down again prior to beginning our meal); you will be greeted with lousy take out chopsticks and disposable napkinsThe little towelettes they provide to wipe your fingers is a nice touch The sushi is a bit underwhelmingThe omakase felt rushed and the quality subpar; especially when compared to its sister downstairs in the chemistry roomSome pieces were great, while some consisted of Ingredients that, ironically, had no chemistryFor $100, which is only $25 less than the chemistry room, this place is a hard passLastly, we ordered the crab hand roll at the end, incredibly salty, completely lacking any savorinessFinal note, we tried to end the meal with the matcha cream brûlée, their only desert available, and they were out; how can you be out of the only dessert you have to stock up on?!?Overall, I loved the chemistry room, but sushi lab roof top is a hard pass, especially when it's only a $25 difference",0
"Solid 3... Came here for a business lunch this week and was a totally disappointed :( the waitress seemed very busy although it was empty at 12. We put our order in and as the meal was coming out, she mentioned they had no goat cheese for the cranberry & goat cheese salad. She offered Parm. Parm was the only cheese available. I then switched my order to a Caesar salad, she actually had to take the salad from the server and quickly run to the kitchen since it was already on it's way to the table... awkward. I also ordered a side of fries well-done, they were ok! The Caesar salad was very peppery so we didn't really eat that. I'm so bummed, I love the location and menu options and the atmosphere is great as they have large windows with high-too table seating. They also had great happy hour options although I'm not sure I'd return...",0
"I absolutely love this restaurant. The food is wonderful and authentic. I've been supporting them during covid with delivery. Honestly, you can't go wrong.",1
"I had a great time at Hunan Slurp, thanks in part to the delicious food and great atmosphere. The highlight of our meal was the fish mifen, which was cooked perfectly and had a delicious broth. The only downside was that there were a few bones in the fish, which made it a bit less appetizing. The app we ordered, the salad, was also delicious and filling. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend Hunan Slurp to others.",1
"I had a great time at El Paso! The food was really good, and the service was great. I really liked the burritos - they were really filling and had a great flavor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I had a slice at Joe's Pizza in Greenwich Village and then had one here about an hour later. There's a big difference. I was able to get one slice at Joe's for $3 and two slices plus a can of soda at 99 Cent Fresh Pizza for $2.75. 

My verdict is that I'd gladly pay the $3 for one slice at Joe's every day of the week.This is good filler food... and something I'd use to feed to my kids or after a long hard happy hour, but it's not something I'd seek out to eat. For me, the dough and the spices (or lack there of) in the sauce are just not up to snuff.It's fresh... it's pizza... it's just not for me.",1
"I had a really great time at Laut, specifically because of their nasi lemak. The two items we tried were really good, and I definitely recommend them if you're in the area and craving Malaysian food. The only downside is that the quantity was a bit small, but it was still good. The satay tofu was also really good, but I would say that it's a bit hit or miss - some people really like it, while others don't. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Laut, and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.",1
"When I learned about this bánh mì shop opening in 2021 during the pandemic, I stopped in to support this new small business. It's a tiny, take-out only shop in Chinatown with several bánh mì options as well as other Vietnamese dishes & desserts. CASH ONLY.But, I usually just get bánh mì here because they are pretty good. My go to is the #3 Bánh Mì Thit Do Cha Lua that has sliced pork, Vietnamese ham, pâté, and all the veggie fixin's I like. The baguette has just the right crusty outer shell but not too hard.The sandwiches are well-filled, which is unusual for NYC, but more like the bánh mìs I used to get in other cities.Prices have already increased since opening from about $6-7 to $8+ for bánh mì, but I haven't noticed any cutback in the amount of ingredients you get (for now). It is what it is, but I did like that they used to have better prices than their competition when they first opened.p.s. The owners have since opened another restaurant, Kitchen Cô Út with more Vietnamese dishes on Chrystie St.",0
"Shalel is a good restaurant for lamb meatballs; although the atmosphere can be a little strange, the food is delicious. The service was slow, however, and I would not recommend this restaurant for large groups.",1
"Overall, the food was pretty good at this restaurant. The only downside was that it took a while to get a table and my date's gnocchi dish didn't turn out well (it was supposed to be filled with cheese but it was mostly flour). Otherwise, it's a popular spot so I'm sure they're doing something right. I'd give it 3 stars.",1
"I visited Cafe Luxembourg for breakfast on a Thursday morning and was pleased with the customer service I received. The atmosphere was bright and reminiscent of Paris, France, and the food was delicious. I ordered scrambled eggs, white toast, and sausage and it was all very well prepared. The only downside was that it wasn't enough to fill me, but that may just be my hungry stomach talking. The facilities were clean, and I was able to get to the cafe by taking the 1 local train from 72nd Street station located in Upper West Side between Amsterdam Avenue and End Avenue of West 70th Street.",1
"The three of us dined here back in December, and we were practically shaking with anticipation up until the day of our reservation. It's always great to see another Singaporean restaurant pop up. While Laut Singapura skews on the pricey end, their dishes are pretty tasty nevertheless.The mango kerabu (sour mango salad) was nice and refreshing. We also liked the kang kung (water spinach and okra cooked in a shrimp paste sauce), even though there was less okra than we would've liked. This side dish is spicy and oily, though, and very strong in shrimp paste flavor, so just a heads up if that's not your thing.We also wanted some kind of starch, and the golden fried rice with salted duck egg was fine, but I couldn't detect the salted duck egg as much. The kway teow, on the other hand, was cooked perfectly and that deliciously smoky wok flavor really lingered in the noodles. This was one of my favorites of the night.The star of the show, the Singapore chili crab, was tasty and surprisingly easy to crack. We opted to get fried mantou because we thought they'd be crispy outside and soft inside. This was a mistake. Each sliced up piece was oily, overly crispy, and had an unpleasant aftertaste, so I abandoned them after a while. The tomato and egg curry was also a bit too sweet for me, but I still enjoyed it with the crab and packed the remnants home to eat with rice.Start or finish things off with a strong, comforting cup of hot teh tarik.",0
"There were a few things I really liked: the atmosphere, decor, disco music, ordering when and what you want without having to wait for a waiter, paying as you go, and the friendly employees. The food was solidly mediocre. The drink I had was good. (The watermelon one.) But they come out to about $28 each. Everything is VERY pricey. And I don't think it's really worth it. I liked it, but I'm not sure I would go back, and certainly not for food.",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The pizza was delicious and the atmosphere was lively and fun. I would definitely recommend a visit!,1
"Ippudo is a restaurant that has been around for a long time and has what is said to be one of the best ramen broths in the world. The wait times can be quite lengthy, but I was able to try it without any wait time and it was definitely worth it. The broth was so rich and clean and I didn't feel greasy afterwards. The noodles they gave me were the thinner ones, but I didn't have any complaints about them. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool and modern and I'm looking forward to trying it out again. The meat itself was a bit tougher than I'm used to, but it was still good. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Ippudo and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good ramen bowl.",1
"I had a great experience at this bistro. The outdoor seating is really cute and the honey wine and Ethiopian beer are great options. The vegetarian options were varied and flavorful, and the beef dish was good but had a weird aftertaste. The injera was really good and I got plenty of it with my meal. There was no wait, we were quickly seated without a reservation.",1
"I was really looking forward to my meal at this restaurant, but unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The service was slow and inattentive until we complained, and the food was average at best. The Caesar salad was not made table side, and the pastas were also average. The tartufo was also very disappointing, as it had the consistency of something that had been defrosted and then refrozen. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"This is my very first brunch in New York (I don't like the city at all).  My friends finally convinced me to cross the bridge and have some good food in the city.  It's a really nice/small spot and the service was excellent.  Food was good, my latte was on point and overall it was nice.  I ordered a vegetarian wrap with greens, it was a lot but I don't like wasting food so ate it all.  It is a nice spot to have brunch wit a few of your good friends or your significant otter.  It's a bit crowded there, just have patience :).",0
"I was really looking forward to the marinated poke, which is not as common at poke restaurants, but I was not too impressed. The poke is not authentic at all (spoiler there are no real Hawaii poke places in NYC). The overall meal was ok but it was very expensive for a large and the rice to fish ratio was not so great.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at China Jade! The egg drop soup was delicious and had just the right amount of corn. The veggie spring roll was also delicious - crispy and delicious. The beef chow fun was also very good, with a delicious aroma. The rice side was small compared to the amount of tofu provided though, so I ended up leavingovers. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant!",1
"Food was OK. Did not feel like it tasted better than other Malaysian places so I'm just rating it average since the hainese chicken was pretty pricey.Hainese chicken-it was OK. The rice tasted a bit more bland compared to other Malaysian restaurants but less oily, so I guess it's a bit healthier. Taste of the chicken was average. I didn't feel like it was particularly better than other places.Chicken laksa- it was also average. Didn't feel like it tasted better compared to other places.Kaya toast- I didn't actually order it, but they gave it to us thinking we ordered it. We took it back to the counter and told them we didn't order it, and the guy said we did. Oh well, we decided to keep it. I like Kaya toasts and it was good.The white coffee was also good",0
"I visited Mya on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. We had 7:30 ressy and were seated right away. The drinks are pretty expensive. $19 for each of their specialty drinks and $12 for a mock tail. I had the Bonito and it was pretty decent. My partner had the ginger drink - and that one was even better.

The food was meh. It wasn't bad but there was nothing to write home about either. The pumpkin Guac was a fresh take but the cheese overpowered so you hardly tasted the pumpkin. The empanadas were bland and a bit oily. The tacos were tiny but tasty. We tried the build your own with pork (this one was the winner) and the shrimp (this one is not a winner). No dessert for us.... Mya come back again purely for the atmosphere and decor. The service was pretty good too.",1
"4.5 stars for the porter house; 3 stars for the sides; 1 star for the serviceWent there for my birthday and booked through opentable noting the special occasion. We were seated on time. The server only dropped by our table once to order the food for us and not even asked how it went when the food was served. Let alone my birthday. When we ordered the asparagus, he didn't ask about which option and just gave us the plain one. We thought it should come either black pepper. when we asked him about it, he just said I didn't specifically mention that, so he just ordered one for us. Really?! Will not go again.",0
"This is simple. I dont care of the food is good - it is.I dont care if the drinks are good - they are.Dont care if the service is friendly - it is.And the clientele is nice - although they let me in...What I do care about, and you should too, is that this establishment  supported the first St. Baldricks Event.  That means some crazy people came here first, and shaved their heads in solidarity with kids with cancer, who were upset about losing their hair, so they didn't feel so conspicuous. They helped start a charity that has raised tens of millions to cure cancer. And grants have been given all over the country and the world, and cancer WILL be cured ahead of schedule due to St B's.  So stop in and have a pint and say hi to Paul and Dan and Phil and Collette and support, because they support humanity.  Thank you!",0
"We made a reservation for 5 for dinner this past Saturday evening.  Our group was seated immediately as it was before the dinner rush. We ordered the Peking Duck Dinner for 5, which comes with One Peking Duck and choice of 3 entrees. It is $44 per person with a minimum of 4 persons. Appetizers that came with the meal:Steamed DumplingSpring RollBarbecued Beef (not my fave)Hot & Sour (or Duck Soup)We chose these 3 entrees which were all good: General Tso's ChickenSliced Beef w. Scallops (Served on a Sizzling Plate)Sliced Pork, Chicken and Shrimp with Green ScallionsDessert that came with the meal:Fried Banana w. WalnutsWe also ordered the Grand Marnier Prawns which was delicious.We really enjoyed our meal, but there was way too much food!  Service was pretty good too. The servers consistently came to refill our hot tea, water, and cleared plates. For our party of 5, the bill was about $300 with tip.",0
"I had been to the location on 28th and Park, and really fell in love with the food at that location, so I'm happy that this location did not disappoint! It is rather spacious and quite dark inside, so be careful when you first enter and your eyes are adjusting to the darkness. We were shown to a booth and our server greeted us promptly to take our drink orders. I really liked our server--he was very friendly! However, I did tell him that we were there to celebrate a birthday, and I assumed he forgot because they did not bring out a birthday treat. When I asked him about it after the check was already paid for, he said that they only do something if we order from the dessert menu. I would have been more than happy to do that, but was disappointed he didn't tell me that earlier. I will also say there was a pretty long time between placing our orders and waiting for our food to arrive. The drinks came rather quickly though. I ordered the salmon, which came with pomme purée and bok choy (sprinkled with Parmesan -- sounds like a weird combo but it was delicious)! The salmon was seasoned well and cooked just right, and I adored the pomme purée, which was super creamy. Literally savored every bite and by the end of the meal my plate was totally free of any crumbs. Heads up about the drinks! The Double B was light and refreshing, not super alcoholic. The Manhattan was quite boozy. The Crisp Martini was very tart but boozy.",0
"I came to this restaurant during Valentine's week and it was perfect timing! They had a special prefix menu and everything was delicious. My favorite dish was the chicken wings, they were super flavorful and I definitely recommend them! I'll definitely be back here!",1
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. The tuna poke bowl was perfect and had just the right amount of crunch and greens. The chicken lollipops were a bit chewy, but the steak salad was good. The piece de resistance was definitely the s'mores dessert. Holy Moly THIS WAS GREAT. Gooey chocolate brownies topped with slightly toasted marshmallows, graham crackers and a superbly cool scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummmmmmm... the cheesecake was tasty too but nothing compared to the s'mores situation. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
Highly recommend there shrimp fried rice There mango smoothie & there beef on a stick spicy Love this cute little Chinatown spot,0
"This is a new Indonesian noodle/street food restaurant which I had been wanting to go for awhile and after running some errands recently, I got there. It is a very small place-it is below street level so you walk down into it. There are several tables for seating but in the limited time I was there, there is a lot of take out going on. i looked over the menu with some help from Omar. You choose your flavor 2 dry indomie and one soup indomie. You choose your size-single or double and then add your toppings which are numerous. After looking over the menu, I decided on the indomie rebus onion chicken, a soup, a double with the popcorn chicken and shrimp. The popcorn chicken were numerous but the shrimp less so.  There are also a series of starters, sweets, coffees and beverages. My noodle soup arrived shortly and it was delicious with a little kick to it. I also got some bottled water. It is great for a quick meal or a late night snack with friends. Omar was very helpful in explaining things and there were also racks of Indonesian snacks and beverages. It is new, reasonably priced and different in the culinary diverse Hell's Kitchen. I would recommend and return",0
"Overall, we had a decent experience at Yelpers Mamacita's Mexican Restaurant. The food was good, and the service wasn't terrible. However, we did run into a few issues that detracted from the overall positive experience. In particular, we felt like we were squeezed in quite tightly at times, and our waitress seemed less than enthusiastic about her job. Additionally, our drinks were rather watered down and not carbonated, and we didn't receive our wine order until well after our meal had ended. All things considered, we would probably go back, but only if the situation were less hectic.",1
"We tried more food and loved it: ma po tofu and Singapore mei fun. Both were spicier than anticipated (I love spice); it was delicious! Very quick, and again very fresh perfectly not-oily shrimp rolls.(Odd: cash or venmo only!)",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The margaritas were delicious and the shrimp dish I had was really good. The only downside was that the skirt steak with mole that many of my friends ordered was really gross, so I'd recommend avoiding that. The location was really frustrating though, as it was really crowded and people were constantly bumping into us. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"I was not impressed with the food at this restaurant. The paella was not good and the sangria was weak. The view is scenic, but it does not make up for the poor food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Hill Country Barbecue Market is a great place to go for a barbecue fix! The meat was delicious and the sides were really tasty as well. The only downside was that the cole slaw was not my favorite. It was a little too bitter for my taste. However, the other sides were really good. The mashed sweet potatoes were especially delicious. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious barbecue!",1
"I'll caveat this review that I had reservations at 2:45 and they close at 3 pm so the situation is not ideal but that's no excuse for execution at this fine establishment. I started off with asking for their house white wine. Can't recall the ambit it was crisp and refreshing, perfect for a lunch meal. Although at $18/glass, you might think twice. The octopus dish had one flavor:burnt. I didn't taste anything else. That was a bummer. The spaghetti with clams was out of this world deliciousness it saved the entire experience. Perfectly executed. It may very well be the best spaghetti dish I've ever had. The bucatini was also perfectly cooked. Overall, solid but felt rushed and uneasy, partly because of me but also with the staff running around the restaurant. It's not a cheap venue so my expectation will be high. Will return as I think this is a one off and the restaurant probably deserves a 5*.",0
"I've tried the regular hand pulled noodles with their beef soup, but still find the knife cut noodles to be better (i like wider noodles in general). My favorite thing on the menu is still the pork belly buns. I've ordered their fried pork and chive dumplings a few times, and felt like for some reason it was undercooked. Not cash only, but they have you pay tax if you do choose to use your credit card.",1
"You know how sometimes you just crave fried chicken? Well next time that happen to you, COME HERE! Jacob's Pickles is a southern foodie dream that specializes in varieties of fried chicken sandwiches and biscuits. And of course pickles, but the chicken and biscuits are why you are here. Comfortable inside with a lively atmosphere, come at off peak times to avoid a wait. However, even if you have to wait, you will be glad you came. Portions are gigantic too, so you definitely get your money's worth. One of the only truly great options in the UWS for a casual meal IMO",0
"I went to Mao's Bao for lunch and the doughy bun is the best part of these buns - so pillowy and fresh and crispy, too. The fillings were a little too Indian-inspired for me, with cumin and curry in the chicken and lamb baos, not a fan. But the pork buns were definitely good, like little wontons.",1
"I had a great experience ordering delivery from this restaurant! The pulled pork sandwich and side of Burnt End Baked Beans were both delicious. I also liked the ginger molasses cookies. I've tried the brisket sandwich before, and that is also excellent!",1
"Food 10/10Every single dish was outstanding and had so much complexity. The set menu was so colorful and varied, and the dessert was amazing too. I especially enjoyed the duck and the caviar, although I do think the menu is not the most cohesive. Each dish was spectacular but there was a little too much red meat at the end. The wine that was recommended fit so well with the menu, I found a new favorite champagne and white wine. Atmosphere 10/10We went for my birthday, so we were seated at the private dining area downstairs. It was a table for eight, and everything was absolutely beautiful. Loved the privacy and the interior furnishing choices. Had wifi down there too! Service 10/10Amazing service, lovely recommendations, really made sure that all of our needs were attended to and super friendly too. Great balnce between conversation and respecting our own space.",0
"Una is a restaurant that I didn't believe the hype when I walked in. The pizza was amazing, and I can definitely taste the difference in ingredients. The only downside is that the pie is a bit pricey, and the dough is a bit light. But overall, I was very satisfied with my experience at Una.",1
"Stumbled across this place while window shopping, and it was such a great experience! It was warm evening so we dined outdoors (the lights were a vibe!), and we had no wait on a Sunday evening despite not having a reservation.Tried the Cacio e Pepe, Spaghetti Pomodoro with Meatballs, and the Margherita Pizza. My favorite of the night was the Margherita Pizza - super flavorful and had fresh basil and mozzarella!! The spaghetti was plated beautifully and the sauce was so tasty, but the meatballs(+$7) were just ok and a little pricy. I'd probably get this dish again, but without the meatballs. Also not a huge fan of Cacio e Pepe, but my friend ordered it and it was so good!! For about $30/person, this place was tasty and affordable. Was pleasantly surprised at how fun and ambient it was, especially since we randomly stopped in. I'll definitely be back to try their other amazing dishes!",0
"I had a great time at Chow House! It's definitely a popular spot on the weekends, so be prepared to wait for a table, but the food is worth it. Highlights include the delicious soup dumplings and the beef tendon, which is really spicy. The margheritas are a nice touch too. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit cramped, so it can be a bit noisy. Overall, a great restaurant that I would definitely recommend.",1
"Felice 64 is a great Italian restaurant with delicious food and great service. I loved the Spaghetti Carbonara and Crostone con Avocado, and the bread used in the Crostone con Avocado was fantastic. The poached eggs were also amazing. The only downside was that the restaurant was quite busy, so it was hard to get our waiter's attention. Overall, I highly recommend Felice 64.",1
"Don't waste your time or money at this restaurant. The pizza was terrible and the service was almost nonexistent. I was robbed while I was there, so it's not worth it in my opinion.",1
"I was so excited to go to Jacob's Pickles again and I wasn't disappointed! The service was wonderful, the food was delicious, and the portions were really generous. I especially loved the biscuits - they're definitely a must-try! The only downside is that the condiments are served in disposable cups, which makes it a bit difficult to enjoy the food fully. But overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend Jacob's Pickles to anyone.",1
"I love that this place has grill it yourself table grills even if you select to sit outdoors. The outdoor seating is built so you can sit comfortably even if it's raining or cold. And even though we were the only folks sitting outside, they were impeccable with the service! On Wednesdays they have $3 off Kobe beef short rib ($7.95), which is a good deal. All the meat we got was fresh and tasty. I felt so happy to eat shio-tan beef tongue for the first time in a few years. Highly recommend!",0
"I stopped by this restaurant a few times and the line moves quickly so the wait usually isn't more than 5-10 minutes. Totally worth it for a simple yet tasty meal. The small portion of rice, cabbage, your meat of choice, and a ladle full of flavorful meat marinade is just enough to fill you up. And it's $4.75. Yeah, I also had to pick my jaw up off the floor. Get a large size for around $6-6.50, and if you get more than one type of meat it might hit an astronomically expensive price of $7. Sometimes the meat has more fatty/chewy parts than I'd like, but for the price, I really can't complain.",1
"This restaurant is great for a business meeting. The food is authentically Greek, and the portions are reasonable. They require a vaccination to dine in, but it's worth it!",1
"The food here wasn't great, but the atmosphere is really nice. The prices are a bit high, but it's worth checking out if you're in the area.",1
"Solid meal, had the premium omakase. Good variety small portions. Remained hungry afterwards. Solid service, I would come back and try ordering off the regular menu.",0
"I went to Hao Noodle for dinner and ordered the Seafood Fried Rice. It was a pretty standard bowl of fried rice with shrimp- good but not too special. The dried scallops on top were a nice touch to add a bit of crunch. The portion size was pretty large, but that was offset by the fact that it costs $20.The best part of this restaurant is probably the ambiance and environment. The main dining area is nicely decorated with greenery in the indoor space underneath skylights that provide some natural light. The rest of the restaurant has a more dimly lit intimate kind of atmosphere. It is also cool that the kitchen is located near the center of the restaurant and you can see them cook the food right there. The service speed is fast, but the staff always seemed to be in a rush and were not particularly friendly- a speed vs. friendliness trade-off.Overall, Hao Noodle is definitely a solid choice for Chinese food and noodle/rice dishes. Don't expect a 5 star experience, but you can certainly expect a good 4 star one.",0
"I had a great time at the Totally New Capitol Diner! The owners have really done a fantastic job with the restaurant - it's fast, friendly, accurate, and very clean. The menu is also very user-friendly, with no menu misspelling. The banana split was really good, and the prices are definitely reasonable. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!",1
"Ordered a Cobb salad for dinner tonight for pickup. Food was ready when promised - a steeper pickup time than most places, but wasn't a problem as I wasn't going to be heading out of the office until then anyway. The Cobb salad had chicken, bacon, avocado and bleu cheese with a really yummy vinaigrette that I asked for extra of on the side (they obliged). Portion size was pretty big. I wasn't starving so I ordered a salad for a slightly lighter option and I was struggling to finish it. For $14, a great value compared to salads in a similar price point (like Sweetgreen). Portion size of protein was pretty good too. Bacon was super crispy and yummy, chicken was a little bland but the dressing went a long way. Wish it had egg and/or tomato like a more traditional Cobb salad, but it was good nonetheless. Would order again as a somewhat-healthy alternative to other options. Place is cute on the inside but has limited seating. It was full when I was there (6:30 on a Friday). There is a decent amount of outdoor seating as well and has a very ""open"" feel.",0
"The food at this restaurant is always amazing, and this visit was no exception! We came with a group of four and got the prosciutto with pizza fritta, arancini, piselli, and salsiccia to start, followed by two orders of the cacio pepe along with the linguine nero and the ricotta gnocchi, and then finished with a special apricot tart, the chocolate torta, and their mango olive oil gelato. We loved everything and would consider getting any of these again. The sausage was maybe the biggest surprise -- this isn't typically our favorite kind of thing, but this was excellent and the spicy mustard that came with it was really outstanding. The Calabrian chile oil that comes with the arancini also really hit the spot for me again, but I'd also have a hard time not ordering their prosciutto on a future visit. The desserts were new to us, and we were really impressed -- the tart was good, but the torta and the gelato were both really excellent.",1
"I wasn't impressed by this restaurant last time, but decided to give it another try since my bf wanted to go. We were seated instantly, but given time to look over the menu. Unfortunately, I was given the beef version of the special advertised on their yelp story - it literally tasted like hamburger in ramen. The noodles were thin but pretty good, but I didn't like the broth or the yuzu flavoring. My bf enjoyed his pork bowl (tontoro pork). I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
"After unexpectedly ending up in the LES of my favorite restaurants, we found ourselves at this neighbor. Prices were decent, drinks delicious, and food yummy and interesting. Our only issue was with desserts - we've been getting disappointing desserts of late where we go, and this was not an exception. I asked for a recommendation, and the server said go for the pineapple brûlée. I blame myself, you know what they say. It was not. It was a small pineapple with a little sugar crust that was torched to achieve caramelization. Womp womp. Otherwise, great for groups and that chicken and potato salad was yum.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the decor was really cute. The only downside was that the Bloody Mary was a little disappointing. It was pretty basic, without any garnishes or special flavor. But the staff was great and they were very accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place to others. Prices were also quite reasonable.",1
"I have to leave a new review for this location. I have been to the 35th street one pre pandemic.This location is bigger and able to adhere to spacing requirements.It's easy to get too. As a matter fact, I have passed this place by several times and did not know it was here.We had dinner reservations for 6 people. It was Friday night and the restaurant didn't feel super crowded. We had those Plexiglass dividers between our table and the next. It was nice because it added a bit of privacy for each patron.My friend took the liberty of ordering for the table. Everything was wonderful. I remembered some of the items from years back but there were a few new things we didn't have before.My favorites were prob the Tuna Tartare dish, tacos (I believe we had thr Bulgogi), I enjoyed the Japchae this time around, and fried asparagus.Only thing I would add is they beef up their tea supply. It was winter and we wanted some after dinner tea or coffee but they weren't really equipped for all that. They gave us some tea bags but it was like meh. But they tried. The waiter said they use to have more offerings but it wasn't a big hit I guess.Oh can't forget dessert. The churro and ice cream was the best out of the 3. Other was bread pudding and chocolate mousse type cake. Good but the churro was the best.",0
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always delicious and the staff is always so friendly. I've had a lot of private events here and they always do a fantastic job. I especially love the duck here - it's really good! And they don't charge for hot tea, which is really appreciated. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great Chinese meal!",1
"I hate writing negative reviews, especially when restaurants continue to struggle. That said, after being almost an hour late and a couple of phone calls to inquire about our delivery I was hung up on both time without so much as a ""we'll get it to you shortly"".Can't really say if the food was good or bad, cold pad see ew is tough to grade.....That's just not cool.Upside, there are a ton of other Thai restaurants in midtown.",0
"I stopped by this place for lunch and found it to be quite busy. The pizza was decent, but I really loved the white with spinach. The ricotta on a pizza is a must-have for me. The only downside was that it was quite busy and I had to stand or sit at the counter, which was a bit of a hassle. But overall, I had a good experience and would definitely recommend this place.",1
"I made a 7:30 reservation at this restaurant and they honored it no issue. The place has two floors and it has a cool vibe. We went with my daughter's future son-in-law and cousin and we all had interesting margaritas that were good. The guacamole was on point and the tortilla chips tasted home made. I had a Cod dish that was delicious. Not sure how they seasons it, but it was great. The service was good. The bill was as expected. Not cheap, but for the quality of the food it was ok. I highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with my visit to this restaurant. The service was fast and friendly, but I was disappointed with the food and drinks. The gauc had no flavor to it, and I had to ask for salt and pepper after eating it. I also ordered a frozen coconut margarita, but it was too sweet and the rainbow drink that I ordered was too bitter. The shrimp in my wet burrito was also over cooked. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"I came here for a quick brunch on a Saturday around noon in January 2020. I was staying at a hotel a short walk away and had a craving for dim sum, but didn't feel like going farther out to Chinatown. Dynasty Dim Sum had a pretty varied menu so I thought I'd check it out.When I arrived, the place wasn't too busy; there were a few customers already seated, but multiple available tables. I had a craving for the radish cakes, a childhood favorite, so I ordered those as well as the BBQ pork matcha buns, since I'd never really had anything similar and wanted to try something new. I also got the Hello Kitty buns, complimentary with check-in; these seemed to be pretty well known since the customers at the tables around me had also checked in to get them.I really enjoyed both of the savory items I got. The radish cakes were hot and tasted as I expected and wanted. The matcha buns were very tasty too, although I think I would have maybe liked a bit more filling. The Hello Kitty buns made for a nice dessert and are definitely Instagram-friendly, although I wouldn't have paid for them if they weren't free with check-in.The service was polite and efficient. The prices around this area are a bit high in general, so my final bill of around $17 after tip and tax didn't seem unreasonable given the location of the restaurant. Definitely not a bad place to stop for some dim sum if you're in the Kips Bay area and don't feel like venturing too far.",0
"Wow this place sucks.  This is a brunch review.We had stopped in the night before and it was packed. A jazz band, with families eating dinner. It looked great. So we went the next morning for brunch.It was dead empty at peak brunch time. We should have just walked out.We got a corner table and when we sat, the couple next to us left, leaving 2 full drinks and a full plate of wings. Of course, another sign we ignored.Our waitress took a bit to come, but was nice enough. It seemed like she wasn't very experienced but it took a while for her to enter our food and then proceeded to read it back to us very slowly.We ordered, the friend chicken and waffles and eggs and biscuits and gritsThe food came and half of it was cold and chewy. It was very obvious that they were just reheating the food from yesterday. But it was Saturday, so where was this brunch food being reheated from when they don't do weekday breakfast?Odd. Salad was wilty. Waffles flavourless. Chicken chewy and serving was TINY.You're a restaurant in Harlem, serving a joke for chicken and waffles? I mean, I guess. Both tables were having problems next to us. On the right, the couple were missing food. One person was just sitting there while the other person ate lmao. Then the manager came over and apologised, saying they forgot to input the order.Another couple was seated and waiting 15 minutes for service, eventually getting up to grab the waiter themselves.I would skip this place. I guess because they got here before the wave of gentrification, they're like the cat that got the cream. But soon, they'll have to pick up their slack or be shut down. Waste of money. Waste of time. ALSO, EXTREMELY LOW QUALITY MIMOSA.",0
"One of the few places I know of that's open for dine-in dim sum at the moment. They're available for outdoor dining and ready-to-eat/frozen dim sum to go downstairs at 9:30AM. Also offered is indoor seating starting at 10:30AM. Middle of the week, right when they open, is the best time to go. They get busy after 12PM, and the service experience goes downhill.On a positive note, they seem to take their COVID measures seriously. All the staff wears masks and gloves, and some even had face shields as an extra precaution. Each table has hand sanitizer with new table cloths after every customer, and they do tracking and check-ins downstairs. Onto the food, dim sum seemed expensive to me. However, I am not familiar with the NYC dim sum scene, so I don't know what prices are typically, but my meal came to $84 (before tip) for 3. I didn't check out their regular dine-in menu.What I Ordered:Siu Mai & Swan Dumpling- average, not as picturedSticky Rice in Lotus Leaf- dry chickenLeek Dumpling & Sticky Dumpling- not much fillingPork Pastries- flaky, goodShrimp Flat Noodle- good, drenched in soy sauceMelon Balls- strong sesame flavor, surprise peanut chunks insideAlso, they supposedly have turnip cake available, but I didn't see it on the dim sum menu.",0
"I ordered takeout from Mokja in the UES location thinking it was the same place I had ordered from before. Turns out I was wrong and it was ordered here. My bad on my part. I got here an hour later than pickup time but all went well. The female working there noticed I was huffing & puffing. Asked if I was ok and I told her the whole story of what happened. I just missed the pouring rain too. She was so sweet and wished me well after I picked up my order.

An hour later at home, I tried the food and everything was delicious!!! I ordered 12pc wings (half/half), spicy tuna kimbap, and kimchi pork tofu stew. I couldn't really differentiate all too much between the soy garlic wings and the gochujang(?) ones but either way, it was delicious. Even reheated in an air fryer the next day! The kimbap was standard but tasty. The kimchi stew for me was the star of the takeout. It hit the spot and fulfilled the craving for me! Although by time I got home, 1/4 of the soup was gone because the pork soaked most of it, we still were able",1
"I stopped in at this sports bar recently for a quick bite to eat. The vibe is really cool - it's like a sports bar but with a more modern feel. The space is huge, and there's plenty of seating. I ordered a burger and fries, and my friend got the chicken sandwich. Both meals were really good. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were a perfect side. Our waiter was really friendly and helpful, and the place was clean and well-maintained. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good burger and some good beer.",1
"Ivan Ramen is a great place to go with family. My sister and cousin ordered the Tonkatsu and they both enjoyed it. The dynamic flavors in the ramen separated it from other ramen they've had. I ordered the spicy ramen and it was on point with the heat. The steamed pork buns could use some improvement, but the Coney Island fried tofu was delicious. Overall, Ivan Ramen is a great place to eat and I would recommend it to others.",1
"I had a nice time at this restaurant, but I wasn't blown away. The staff was busy and my table was neglected, but the food and drinks were nice. The inside is beautiful.",1
"All the food was delicious. The spicy seafood stew was so good and perfectly spiced for a cold night. Pretty pricey but nyc ktown is quite expensive for korean food in general compared to other cities. They only accept cash or Amex which I thought was really random. They serve cold barley/corn tea instead of water which I really enjoyed and was refreshing. Fun restaurant at night with the music and ""indoor outdoor"" seating for covid.",0
"""I've never heard a single bad thing about this place"" - Coworker. I have my criticisms about the decor but when your main source of income is definitively the lunch rush crowd, why invest in overhead?Just when you start to think ""if you had szechuan once, you've had them all"", Mala House lays down the spicy hammer of justice, with punishing levels of heat. So far Mala House is amongst the favorite of my office, even boasting portion sizings that some have had to save for later.A standout specialty that I'd recommend to any person regardless of familiarity with Szechuan dishes is the dry hot pot. Essentially they're shreds of beef with a subtle tingling heat sensation. A quick universal appeal. But if you're still apprehensive then don't feel ashamed about defaulting to General Tso's, cause they still incorporate that classic peppercorn flavor but to a hint, to really make for a subtle distinction from your classic takeout joint.Overall, be a dear and spice up your life.",0
"P J Clarke's is a decent place to go for lunch, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner. The food is decent, but the service can be a bit slow. The bar is a great place to hang out, and the staff is always friendly. The only downside is that the wait for a table can be quite long, so I recommend arriving early if you're looking to eat here. The appys were good, but the tuna tartare tacos were my favorite. The arugula salad was a bit too salty for my taste, and the salmon over chopped salad was a bit bland. The fries were delicious, though.",1
This pizza was pretty good! We ordered it for pickup on Seamless app (they had a big coupon...check it out!). It wasn't technically ready on time but the wait wasn't bad and it was hot & fresh out of the oven. I personally prefer San Matteo for Napoletana pizza but this pizza was still good! It's a crispier crust vs. the soft crust at San Matteo. I would definitely recommend a visit here because you may prefer this type more than I did :) the staff was nice as well!,0
"Taco Tuesdays led my gawky foodie heart to this taqueria establishment. The line is always suuuper long here during the lunch rush. Luckily I was held up at work and taking a late lunch proved me lucky. No wait to try these sinfully delicious tacos. When I heard Los Tacos opened a location in the Soho area, I had to try it as it was only known in the west coast. Got the Carne Asada (grilled steak) tacos and the Adobada (marinated pork) tacos with the flour tortillas with everything on it. An explosion of flavors from the first to last bite. Ever had that feeling where you overhype a place in your head, and the food hits all of your expectations? That's everything here at Los Tacos. Spicy, rich, a hint of crisped meats and freshly made. Even my corn chips was baked right out of the oven and the salsa was fully ripe with all the right seasonings. Nothing from here scared my taste buds and did exactly the opposite. Makes me want to try the cactus tacos on my next visit. Yup you heard me right, cactus tacos indeed.",0
"On one of my study binges, I decided to order from UberEats to save some time. I was in the mood for Indian food, and Chapati House was the first such listing I came upon.I ordered my favorite Indian dish, chicken tiki masala, and waited for my order to arrive.The wait time was reasonable, and I was munching down in no time. My tiki masala was delicious, and it came with a side of white rice and naan. I can tell that the food was freshly prepared, and cooked with care. The naan was warm and soft, and the chicken came with the right balance of spices.As far as Indian food in Manhattan, this is one of many great options. I'll consider them the next time I'm in the mood for Indian food.",0
"I was looking for a vegetarian friendly decent Mexican place near Hell's Kitchen and my search in Yelp led me to Masmasita. Usually all the places serving vegetarian food catch my attention easily, same was the case here. On top of that, I noticed a few reviewers commenting good about the vegetarian food here. So my husband and I decided to have dinner here. I had called in advance to see if I needed to take reservation and whether the place was a kid's friendly (I had plans to have dinner in an Indian place in Hell's kitchen today and got to know only in the last minute to my dismay that they don't provide high chair) but the person who picked my call told me that we could walk in and that the place was kid's friendly. It's a tiny place and people welcome us very friendly. The server got us seated right away and gave us a high chair. Not many people were in the place (may be because of today being July 4th). I was quite impressed by the menu as rarely we get to see such extensive choices for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I had vegetarian quesadilla and fried jalapeños. My husband had chicken chimichanga. We tried the July 4th special margaritas as well. We also got a tresleches cake and chips and salsa free. The salsa was spicy (we liked it) and the food tasted delicious. The cake was kind of tasting as if it was kept in freezer since long time. The owner was very friendly and cordial which made the overall experience pleasant. The only problem I had is that the person who brought food to our tables was the same one who was cleaning the other tables and he didn't even wear a gloves. Now that does concern me. I hope this will be taken care of!!",0
"Ordered delivery. Tried the Yum Nam Sod Salad. Delivery was quick. Packed neatly.**This TINY salad is NOT worth $13.95!!!**It contains a small amount of salami, peanuts, red onion, salad greens, scallion, cilantro and ginger with a chili lime dressing. The flavors were fresh. But again, just so small and not worth the price. I will not be ordering from here again. It's not even filling.",0
"So I went here a couple weeks ago and had a very strange experience. Let's start with the ambience, upstairs is a regular bar and down stairs is the speakeasy it's super dark has red lighting and a live piano player. I wasn't crazy about the piano player and of course we were seated right next to him. So if you sit to the left by the piano just know you will be yelling to whoever you are with all night.Since it was our first time there we asked the waitress for her drink and food suggestions. Neither one of us liked our drinks. I had some sort of coconut drink and it had no real flavor and couldn't taste any lq in it. She said the pizzas and chicken sandwich were popular. We ordered the fried chicken sliders...a pizza with sausage and the wings. Talked and ate some of our food and packed it to go like I said we didn't love the music.By the time we got 4 blocks away heading towards Penn station my friend was throwing up. I couldn't believe he was literally throwing up all over the side walk. We finally got home and I started feeling sick as well. My friend was sick for 3 days. I dont know what was going on with the food but the fact that we both got sick was so crazy. Not sure if something wasn't cooked right and it's not like you can see your food it's so dark.The service was good everyone was nice. I just will not be coming back.",0
"Got breakfast takeout and nothing was worth writing home about except for the fantastic cookies and cream loaf cake. Their avocado toast appears to be served on Bread Alone bread that I also have at home, and the whole thing is just bland. Also pancakes without syrup. Meh.",0
"So many chain pizza shops in this area, its always appreciated to have a real NY pizza place pick up the phone, process your order swiftly and have it ready in 10 minutes.Reliable non chain pizza in Washington Heights. NY style crust, good cheese. Sauce ok. Super courteous, efficient people.Order up and pick up in minutes. Quick, fast, not bad. 3 Star Pizza, 4 for extra courteous people.",0
"I visited El Quijote for dinner and wasn't impressed. The food wasn't great, but it was good enough. The atmosphere was cool and the servers were great. However, I've had better Spanish food in the city for the price. The bean dish was really great, I would recommend that to anyone.",1
"I went to Toloache for a work meeting and it was not too bad.  We arrived it seemed right as they were open and were a bit disorganized; they gave us options for water and the option we selected actually wasn't available. It took a while for the waiter to return to tell us it wasn't available. Hopefully Toloache runs a little more smoothly a little later after opening, but not a big deal.The food was pretty good, but a little pricy in my opinion.  Two tacos are $14-$20 depending the kind you get. That is a lot of money for two tacos with a small side of rice and beans.  I went with the Torta Ahogada, which is a pork carnitas sandwich with some veggies and avocados inside. It comes out with a nice presentation. The sandwich halves are like stood up and it is drenched in a red sauce that is pretty good.  The bread was a bit burnt, but overall it was tasty.We also ordered the Trio de Guacamole.  The guacamole there, in my opinion, is not worth the price. It tasted fine, but nothing special. A single, small bowl is $14 and the trio was $27. The trio is definitely a better value, but all the guacamole options are way too pricy.  My colleagues all got various types of tacos. They enjoyed them and all noted that the rice was a bit spicy.Overall, the food was decent, nothing spectacular, and the price is too high considering the quality and portion size.",0
"The Mary Lane hit all the marks for a great brunch. The vaccination proof check was a nice touch and the seating was comfortable. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and polite. The food was delicious, with standout dishes including the Clinton Street level pancakes, grilled chorizo and duck confit, and pork tostadas. The French fries were exceptional. The Run for the Roses Old Fashion, Aperol Spritz and Bloody Mary made with kimchi were all first rate. Dessert was a slice of olive oil cake that was moist and served with a dollop of mascapone. I would definitely come back for brunch, and I would also recommend trying dinner.",1
"Burger and Lobster is an amazing place to go for a delicious meal! Their lobster roll is definitely worth trying, and their calamari is also very good. The service can be a bit slow at times, but overall this restaurant is definitely worth trying out!",1
"I have mixed feelings about this spot. It is very small and cozy - decorated with wine bottles and corks. It is a little too small, as the table we ate on was no bigger than a nightstand. I was given the 2 appetizer, 2 entree, wine tasting, and take home bottle special as a gift for my bday. I was slightly disappointed that we were told we couldn't pick an appetizer ourselves. A small plate with two pieces of cheese, some olives and a tiny bread slice was what was chosen for us.  I had the pizza as an entree and my friend has the risotto, they were both just ok. However, I was very pleased with the wine tasting. We got 3 tastes of red and 3 of white. I really enjoyed every one we had. You also get to select a bottle of your favorite to bring home, which was awesome. Even though the food wasn't amazing, the price for the wine alone was worth it -especially in NYC. Melissa was a great server as well. All in all I was happy I went.Note: I received the $25 special as a gift through groupon, however, they run the same special for anyone just walking into the restaurant so don't think you are getting anything unique via Groupon.",0
"The atmosphere was really pleasant and the service was attentive. They had a wide selection from their Thai menu and the dim sum sampler was really good. The dumplings and dim sum were a bit over steamed which caused the skin to be a bit soft and fallen off, but it was still a nice experience overall. The happy hour beers were cheap and I would definitely come back.",1
"I had a great time at this black badge elite event, I hadn't been to an elite event in years and was pleasantly surprised when I got the invite for this. Thanks Ruggy! The intimate four seat hotel room at the hotel felt like I was taking part in a new trend such as Airbnb or Turo but with a fresh new concept of using a hotel room for a makeshift restaurant/bar. The host explained how much easier it is to get permits and what not for this kind of venue, and it makes perfect sense to use a hotel room for this kind of function. The decor was great, I love how they still have the 10th floor layout on the back of the door like they would in most other hotel rooms but that's where the impression from the inside that you are in a hotel room ends. The furniture and dining area really transport you to another dimension. The food was amazing as I figured it would and was prepared by a friendly, talented chef who was on top of his craft. The tuna was my favorite followed by the barracuda and Uni. The sake sampler was excellent and went so well with the food, it was well worth it. Nice to see fellow yelpers old and new again, and look forward to coming",1
"Insane. I can't even describe the food... the tahini... the hummus and THAT PITA! Service was meh but the location decor atmosphere and food made up for it! Check this place out for sure, the menu changes every day!",1
Two-room classic French bistro in the Upper East - great for brunch. I was hesitant to go given the mixed reviews but my friend made reservations. I'm happy that I went because brunch was delish. I ordered the steak sandwich which was served with a small side of salad and fries. I ate half and took the rest to go. Definitely recommend you try out this spot in case you are on fence like me.,0
"The pizza here is fine, but I have to bump this review down because they tried to charge us $2 for the ""99 cent"" slice of cheese pizza! I paid with a 10, and only got $8 back in change. Almost didn't say anything, but when I asked if it should've be $9 in change, the guy at the register didn't say a word and just handed me another dollar!? Made it seem like they were hoping I just wouldn't notice.... Anyway, the pizza itself was standard, sauce was tasty and the slice was fresh and thin. The experience though was certainly sub-par, so may go to a different location from now on.",1
"I came to this restaurant during a busy lunch hour on a Sunday and was seated within a couple minutes. The service was quick and the server was friendly. The Ramen was delicious and came within a couple minutes. The tables had hand sanitizer which is always a good thing. They also have a customer restroom which is always appreciated. Overall, this was a great experience and I would definitely come back.",1
"Had Balthazar sandwiches and desserts the past two days in a row courtesy of a couple kind clients. The sandwiches were all very good. Love the fresh bread. It does go stale quick! The cinnamon donut was very yummy. The brownie bites were just okay. The cookies were hard and crunchy but tasted good. I like soft cookies, personally. I would like to try menu items.",0
"Hong Kong Station wasn't my first choice. I was trying to get to Cafe China or Leng Shang but the rain, chilly weather and time constraints made convience top priority. I don't know if HKS is part of the hotel 20 Times Square but its right nextdoor.The decor is very interesting. Ambient lighting, rustic wood ceilings and walls. There was a bar but no alcohol just juice. Unfortunately interesting ended there for me. My crew and I were grabbing food to go so we weren't starving on the bus ride home. I had the chicken with Chinese vegetables. It tasted pretty bland(would have taken a pic but I was on a bus in the dark). Another had the Mai Fun and said it was too salty. I won't go on but suffice it to say we all agreed that we've had much much better. And it was expensive. The portion that I got for 19.00 and some change would cost me about 8.00 back home but it's Times Square. Paid more for location than I did quality or quantity.",0
"I'm not well seasoned in the NYC Vietnamese scene but I did recently go to Vietnam for 3 weeks, and have a new found love for Vietnamese food. Got beef bo luc lac, morning glory, and bun with pork. Everything was solid, nothing blow your mind and it's slightly on the pricey side ($12-19 for mains, $8-10 for apps, $7-8 beers, $9-12 wines, $10-13 cocktails). I think this place could be five stars if they used more fresh herbs and lime. Vietnamese food is so good cause of those fresh, earthy, sour, minty flavors, and I just wasn't getting enough of that. Also birds eye chili's plzzzzz. They had sriracha but meh. All around got my Vietnamese fix, but I'll continue the hunt for better.",0
"I stopped in at this restaurant for their happy hour and was really impressed! They have some great deals going on - a drink comes with a free skewer of your choice, so it's a great way to try some different flavors. I tried the cumin and lemongrass skewers, and both were really good. The frog legs were also really good - the house sauce was already spicy, but the frog legs were still really tender. I would definitely come back and try more items on the menu!",1
"I had a great time at Shalom Aleichem Brunch! The shakshuka was delicious and the portions were really good. The only downside was that the shakshuka was a bit salty, but it was still enjoyable to eat. The potato pancakes were also really good. The service was a bit slow, but that might've been because it was early in the morning. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and I would definitely come back!",1
"I came here at the recommendation of a friend, and had high expectations after hearing that it was run by the same people as Los Tacos no. 1, which I had previously really enjoyed. I didn't have the same positive feelings about this place though. At Los Mariscos, they specialise in fish tacos, and Mexican seafood dishes. The location is near Chelsea Market, and it is a bustling place, in which you order and pay before eating. There are a couple of benches at which you can sit, and it's not the kind of place you linger at after finishing your food. We shared the oysters, while my husband had the fish tacos as his main. The oysters and the tacos were presented in a timely fashion, but the red aguachiles that I ordered took a much longer than expected time to come out. I'd never had this dish before, and also have never seen it any menus in Mexican restaurants. It consisted of a raw prawns in a slightly spicy red sauce, with cucumbers and red onions. I liked the flavors in the dish, but overall, wouldn't rate it as amazing or a must-order. My husband enjoyed his tacos, but also said they weren't the best. The oysters are not something I would recommend. Would not come back based on this experience.",0
"about enough seating for 20 people at a bar. line up until theres room at the bar to seat your party together; mark the items you want on a paper menu, hand it to the chef, get the check, pay at the counter (no need to tip, it's already included!), and go. Made for a pretty fast snack. I enjoyed the nori and the rice; nori was perfectly crispy and salty and the rice was cooked and seasoned well. I had the basic set; crab (creamy, almost tasted like a chicken salad actually), scallop, and salmon. all were fresh and served with a polite attitude.",0
I'm so glad Tang S reopened! I used to stop by after I got off the train and it was always so busy. The food always tasted fresh and hit the spot. I got fried chicken and rice for myself and my roommate got general tso chicken and rice. Both dishes were delicious and hit the spot. I'm glad this neighborhood staple is open.,1
"I really enjoyed the squid ink taglierini at this restaurant! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the seafood was generous. The sauce was a bit bland for my taste, but overall I was very satisfied with the dish.",1
"I had a great time at Sweet Chick. The chicken and waffles were definitely a highlight, but I also really enjoyed the elote appetizer and the biscuits with herbed butters. The only downside was that the drinks didn't hit the mark for me.",1
"So happy that Eliza's Local opened up during COVID, since Draught 55 (it's sister restaurant) hasn't been able to. I really love these two places, especially for their bar specials and my favorite is there nachos. As you can tell from my photo, they do an exceptional job with it, and it never fails to be consistently good. All we got were some strong drinks and good food, but you should definitely some out and support, as they have a small intimate space, that's a really nice change up from the rest of the St. Mark's crowd. Prices are moderate, but you won't be disappointed. Staff was very friendly, and social distancing and cleanliness measures are taken seriously.",0
"Calle Dao, a Cuban-Chinese Eatery in the heart of Chelsea.  Great atmosphere, very relaxed vibe. Amazing service and the food quality is ! We came on a Friday night with a reservation and was seated immediately. We got the Black rice seafood paella (Clams, Shrimp, Mussels, Calamari, Chinese Sausage, Mojo Rojo, Cilantro Crema) and chicken with yellow rice (Grilled Soy Chicken Breast, Saffron Rice, Chorizo, Peas, Sofrito, Scallion-Ginger Sauce). I personally LOVE both dishes.",0
Pretty good noodles and dumplings for its price. Only thing is they don't give free water and make you buy bottled water.,0
"I'm so sorry to write this review and rate it two stars...  I'd rate it one star but the delivery process was really good. Nothing makes up for how badly this pizza tastes. I cannot even describe how it tasted. I thought ""wow...  this is $25... and it's the third worst pizza I've ever had!"" I have no advice on betterment because I had no clue why it tasted so gross. Cheap ingredients?? I don't know...",0
Had the beef pan fried noodles. I have to admit they give you a good amount of food. I couldn't finish my order. There was a ton of beef where usually in other restaurants you don't get enough. I am definitely coming back and the prices are comparative to most Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.,0
"This place is really cool, they are the front for a speakeasy. You can order food inside or dine outside. They have window service outside. Food was phenomenal, I recommend having the chicharrón added on any taco  I had the El Gringo and The carnitas taco. My favorite was the carnitas. My friends had the short rib and shrimp tacos .",0
"I was really happy with my experience at B'artusi! The chicken Milanese was delicious and the sauce matched so well, the chopped salad is a must (not super healthy but delicious). The Tiramisu French toast was not very heavy and it was great as well, although I would add a bit more sauce. Service was attentive but not pushy and the decor was beautiful. I was able to get a table right away on Sunday at 1:30 pm which was also another plus!",1
"My friend and I were looking for a causal place to catch up and enjoy good food and she suggested her go-to spot Noreetuh. This place is pretty under the radar and mostly locals come so it was easy to make a reso online. I arrived a few minutes early and the staff were so nice the moment I walked in.For apps, we got the snow peas, skewer sampler and crudo - all were good portions and delicious. The snow peas were so crunchy and savory. The skewer sampler was perfectly grilled and included bacon wrapped octopus, pork jowl and mushroom.For mains, we got the matsubi sampler - pork, beef, scallop and spicy spam. I love matsubi and these did not disappoint, it was deff worth upgrading the scallop for $5. Last but not least the best dish was the fried chicken - we got the half portion but the portion size was as if it were the whole bird. The fry on it reminded me of Taiwanese popcorn chicken, so crunchy and juicy. It also came with Hawaiian bread, Mac n cheese salad and some pickled veggies (such a good deal for $24).This will definitely be my new go to spot for an affordable yet delicious meal - for all this we paid only $110 including a 20% tip! Thanks again so much for the great meal!",0
I visited this restaurant after 4+ years and the food was great. The drinks were even better. The atmosphere was great too - definitely a place I would visit again.,1
"Basic omakase spot for a good price. They send you a friendly BYOB text. My own personal experience, made a reservation and they didn't have us seated until 25 minutes later. Yes it's NYC, and waiting 25 minutes for a reservation is nothing. True, but it's the way they wanted me to take note of ..... ""... 17 COURSE OMAKASE $125 dollars. If a party doesn't show for their reservation or is cancelled within 24 hours of reservation time, a charge of $50 per person will apply. Please note ALL reservations are for a duration of 75 minutes only. If a party arrives 30 minutes late, you will not receive the full course. For a better quality experience please arrive on time to avert the rushed service... ."" If they limit a duration to your meal, why do I have to wait? Other parties that had the same reservation and parties that arrived fully after me got seated 10 minutes before me when I had to keep waiting. The staff kept apologizing and tried their best to make it up but the whole beginning threw me off and ruined the entire experience for me. I tried to let it go but it was very frustrating not to be able to sit near my reservation time while others arrived after me sat, people pushing you as you are forced to stand there and wait for the restaurant to get their timing right. I did not have a back up place to go but all in all, I already lost my appetite. I've never experience such a timing issue at omakase spots.",0
"I'm always happy with my experiences at Tacombi, and their newest location in LIC is no exception. My favorites are always the carnitas and Baja fish taco, both of which are super solid. The food here is perfect if you're looking for a delicious Mexican fix.",1
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was pretty good, but the portions were a bit small for the price. The Royal pad thai was my favorite dish, and the seafood in the hor mok talay was really good. The sa koo sai moo was also good, but the tapioca exterior got more tasty as it cooled down. The ambiance of the restaurant was really nice, but I don't think it was worth the price tag.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good at this restaurant. The noodles and dumplings were especially good, and the price was reasonable. However, I wasn't particularly impressed with the fact that they didn't give us free water and made us buy bottled water.",1
"I highly recommend this restaurant - the food is super good and the prices are reasonable. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and it was relatively busy, which is a good sign.

I ordered three things to make my over 1 hour roundtrip from the UES worth it. First up, the C4 Burning Noodle. I asked for them extra spicy. Not sure if they really were extra, but they had a nice kick to them that I wasn't expecting.  They didn't look covered in anything too spicy.

Then I ate the E2 cumin chicken.  Its okay, but I probably wouldn't get it again. There was a hint of cumin on the chicken pieces (not fried), but these were not even close to as good as the cumin (albeit lamb) that I had at Szechwan Absolute in Flushing. Theirs had way more cumin.

I saved the best for last. The only item on their menu to have two pepper icons. The B10 Spicy and Numbing Pork wonton (12pcs). This came in a soup full of spiciness and mala, though it took awhile for the mala to build.  It was not as",1
"I live down the street so this is a great option for a vegan quick bite. I have tried the guac burger, pesto meatball sandwich, spicy Thai salad, and air baked fries (both regular and sweet potato). The ketchup is good - it is made from beets. If you leave the fries out too long, they get a little soggy so eat them quickly! The prices are reasonable so try what you want. If you want to avoid meat products but don't have a lot of time, this is the perfect place to have a bite.",0
"I finally visited the newly opened restaurant, Covid, and I'm so glad I did! The food is truly excellent and you can pick anything on the menu and know that it will be good. I especially loved the hummus (get it with the falafel) and the shakshuka. The Israeli guacamole was a very interesting and delicious twist on classic guac, and the labneh was perfect too. The pita is fresh and served hot. Service was great (especially during a COVID heat wave). I suggest focusing on the small plates, ordering a bunch, and sharing everything. I can't wait to go back!",1
"Was skeptical at first because of the lower reviews, but ended up really loving their ramen!  I got the Smoked Pork Ramen and it was so tasty.  My favorite part was the noodles - it was firm and bouncy.  The broth is lighter than your traditional tonkotsu ramen but it had a great umami flavor.  A bit on the saltier side.  The soft poached egg was the most perfect ramen egg.  It oozed all over the ramen.  I loved all of the toppings and felt they all balanced each other out well. Service is really fast if you're looking for a quick bowl of ramen.  Will definitely come back here again!",0
"One of the first Taiwanese restaurants I've been to in NYC. Overall: 3.5/5; Food: 3.5/5; Atmosphere: 4.5/5; Service: 4/5Food: 3.5/5I loved the menu, but I found the dishes to be a little under seasoned and a little bland. Other than that the dishes were well executed and well presented. Tried a really cool sakura beer here.*** = would eat again - ***Pineapple shrimp: Heap of fried shrimp!- Blackened onion and beef: Meat was well cooked and there was a good sized portion. I was expecting a little kick and more saltiness, but it honestly tasted kind of bland. The onions didn't help.- Sausage party: Really unique sausage over sticky rice. The sticky rice was a little bland, but I loved the concept and the sausage.Atmosphere: 4.5/5The restaurant is super chic. Doesn't make you think of an Asian restaurant at all. It almost has a street vibe. Service: 4/5Super, super friendly. Really knowledgeable about the menu which meant he could explain all the dishes to a person who was unfamiliar with Taiwanese food.",0
"This is a great brunch spot to go to with a group of friends where you can order different dishes to share. There were three of us and we ordered the toasted sesame hummus, shrimp + grits, crispy sesame calamari, burrata and some veggies. Everything was delicious and tasty. My favorites are the the hummus and shrimp + grits. The hummus was nicely made and tasted much more flavorful than any other hummus I've had before. For the shrimp + grits, I really like the baked eggs and jalapeño that they put in it. Everything just comes really well together. This was honestly a nice brunch spot to go to with friends where you can order different dishes and everyone gets to try them. Excited to return and try out the other items on the menu!",0
"After reading all of the positive press, I was really excited to finally eat here but it was a major disappointment. The service was fine but the food was uneventful and overpriced for what it is. We ordered the Murtabak Roti, which was very good and the best dish we ate. The other two dishes were uneventful: banana leaf bowl with chicken curry and pad kee mao. Both dishes are for the Western palette, and not what you would eat in Singapore.",0
"Thai Son is a great Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of New York City. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. The restaurant is small, so it's best to call ahead for a reservation. The vegetarian summer roll was so-so, but the flank pho was banging. The grilled pork rice dish was amazing and would definitely recommend it.",1
"My friend and I wanted to try the Peking duck dish that Uluh offered as it is one of their signature dishes and we both like Peking duck. We decided to met up on Friday at 6:30pm. When we arrived it was already packed so we decided to add ourselves to the wait list via QR code. (Side note: this was pretty advanced, not many restaurants do it this way.) Unfortunately and as expected due to the time of day, the wait was quite long so we went to get something to drink around St. Marks. Around an hour later, we came back as there were only a few tables in front of us on the wait list and were seated as soon as we arrived. The menu includes dishes from various regions of China so we were able to pick a few from different regions. One being the Peking duck, platter of dim sum, dan dan noodles and the boneless pig trotters. The dan dan noodles came out first, followed by the pig trotters and dim sum platter. The noodles were not too spicy, but the pig trotters were a bit too spicy for us so we ordered rice to go with it. The dim sum was well made and stuff with lots of filling. The Peking duck was last to be served; the wrap, slices of duck and condiments & garnish were plated neatly. The slices of duck had a crispy layer of skin, but it was also a bit oily. Overall, the food at the restaurant was pretty good and one can diffidently try many different types of dishes. There is a mixture of spicy and non-spicy dishes so one does not have to worry if they cannot eat spicy foods (my friend and I happen to choose two spicy dishes.) The dishes are a bit expensive, but worth a try to go at least once.",0
"Zebra Ramen is a top-notch restaurant with delicious and hearty ramen bowls. The butter broth is creamy and flavorful, and the noodles are nice and springy. The pork pieces are not charred, which is my preference, and they are still tender and delicious. The egg is a nice touch, and the toppings (corn, menma, and bamboo) are perfect for adding extra flavor and texture. The restaurant is definitely busy, but the wait is worth it for a delicious and affordable meal.",1
"Rebel is a great restaurant with delicious food and great customer service. The restaurant is decorated with great art pieces and has indoor and outdoor seating. The live dj was playing great music and the staff was friendly and helpful. The only downside is that the portions are a bit small. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Rebel and would highly recommend it.",1
"The Hudson omelette at this restaurant is delicious! The mashed potato side is also very good, less greasy than most home fries I've had. The omelette is fluffy and has just the right amount of salt, with cheese, ham and tomato. The cappuccino was a bit bolder than I would have liked, but with good foam. The waitstaff is also very friendly. I shall definitely be back!",1
"UBK is a cute little vegan joint in West Village that offers a whole new world of (outdoor) dining out there. I'd been meaning to come by for a while, and finally made it here for brunch with a friend. The wait for food felt a bit long, but it could've just been the heat. I enjoyed the tofu and the kale was very fresh, too! In conclusion, solid food - but I'd probably wait until either a cooler day or ensure a table in the shade before I came by again. Maybe I'll just stick with delivery next time - there's still a few other dishes I'd like to try, and I love myself a good casual vegan joint!",1
"The vegan sushi is the best there is in nyc. This is how all vegan sushi should be, and should be available at all Japanese restaurants. The California roll is nice and refreshing. Spot on flavor to California roll, though it would be even more accurate if the ""crab"" pieces were bigger. Spicy chicken roll - identical to chicken texture. Spicy mayo is identical to non-vegan spicy mayo. It's whole chunks of ""chicken,"" not shredded or minced. Crispy tofu skin roll is identical to a salmon skin roll with eel sauce minus the fishy taste and concern of parasites. Rainbow roll, the bbq ""meat"" on top tastes exactly like Chinese food bbq pork like ""spare ribs"" or the pork cubes you'll find in pork fried rice. The crispy ""shrimp"" is also spot on like flattened panko/katsu shrimp. And the spicy tuna, the flavor is on point, though the texture is more like chopped/minced cooked tuna rather than raw. But it does not taste fishy like cooked tuna. Everything so good I wish I could eat this every day.",0
Excellent. Outstanding service and the ONLY place open at 9:30 PM on a Monday in the area.  The burrata with nuts and honey was out of this world. The chicken millanese was pounded super thin and enough for like three people.  In Rome you must do as the Romans do so I tried the olive oil cake. Was way better than I thought.  However---I'll go with chocolate in the future. Wasn't an option though and the tirimisu was in like a TUREEN.  Seriously in a mixing bowl.  Nothing this good exists in Chicago sadly.,0
"Unfortunately, I am 90% sure I got food poisoning here. About 5 hours after eating dinner at Barbetta, I developed a strong headache (I virtually never get headaches, much less strong ones).  I went to sleep and hoped it would go away, but woke up after only 2 hours with an even worse headache, and vomited out everything I ate. Within 20 minutes post-vomit all those symptoms were gone, so I'm fairly sure this was a Barbetta issue.Otherwise, this was a 3 star review.  The food was enjoyable and well made, but not extraordinary.  The service was good.  It's also just a bit pricey for what it is, in my opinion.",1
"This place has it all. My friend and I stopped in at 2 on the afternoon on a Sunday. They had a limited menu but that wasn't a problem. The restaurant was also pretty empty, so service was quick. Our server asked if we wanted mango juice to start and it seriously hit the spot. We ordered Lumpiang Shanghai, which was hot and tasty. Then our Lechon and Escabeche followed. Both were excellent. The lechon was juicy, crispy and had a delicious liver sauce served alongside. The esabeche was unbelievably delicious. The vegetables on top were phenomenal. Our server, Dice (sp?) made the experience. He asked us if we wanted a larger table and he even asked if we liked the music. Please go and support them!! They were closed due to the Hurricane at the beginning of September and are still putting out excellent quality food. You will not regret it!!",0
Overrated and the food lacked flavor.  I didn't see any Koreans in there.  Neither the workers nor the customers...that was the first bad sign.  The food portions are extremely small and there was no depth of flavor.  Can't see what the hoopla is about.,0
"Would come again! Good lunch grab spot if you work in the area!Food (5/5) - spice level is definitely on the lower end, if you're used to getting medium / whatever is higher than mild at any other establishment, you will probably be fine with extra spicy.The taste and textures were really well done - the vegetables were not overly soggy, sauteed just right, and the sauce was truly imbibed with Sichuan peppercorns, my tongue had this numbing sensation. The chicken texture was also good, flavorful and not too dry, which is often the curse of a dry pot dish.Price (4/5) - It is slightly on the pricier end for a grab and go meal, but the portion somewhat makes up for it. I made 1.5 meals out of my standard pot!Ambiance / service (4/5) - It's a grab and go place, but when I got there there was no one at the counter and no way to ring for the staff, so I wound up waiting outside for a fair amount before knocking on the glass. Felt bad interrupting them, they looked like they had a ton of orders to get through - They're still in the process of officially opening so hopefully this will get resolved!I will say that the concept is pretty unique and I don't think I've seen anything fast-casual / grab and go with this cuisine and concept before. The bag / presentation is pretty and everything was well contained. Nice way to mix up the week.",0
"Pado is a sushi restaurant that I definitely recommend. They have delicious food at a great price, and their happy hour is unbeatable. The apps we got were all really good - my favorite was the avocado bomb. The only downside is that it can get pretty busy, so be sure to book a table ahead of time. The service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is inviting. The only thing I would mention is that the ice cream is free, but it's a pretty small consolation.",1
"Tipsy Shanghai is the New York sibling of a restaurant in Shanghai that was started in 1905. So with that history you would expect amazing flavors and unique Shanghai dishes. Unfortunately, the food at Tipsy Shanghai can only be described as bland and some of their menu items are more American Chinese (shrimp with lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken, etc) than truly Chinese. The restaurant itself is very nice and the service is good, but the food is simply bland. We were hoping for something special and left being disappointed.",0
I didn't know what to think of Zazzy's when I looked at the menu at its new location. (I didn't know the other two so it is new to me.) I had never heard of this melange of pizzas and other vegan/meat delights. I ordered a little of all the veggie stuff. The Hearts of Palm 'Calamari' is Heaven with two dipping sauces (marinara and aioli). The pizza is good although not a lot of veggie variety. Maybe onions or mushrooms. I like the thin crust. The soy cheese slice was pretty much what i expected. Again surprised it's not doctored up with some veggies. I will at minimum get those hearts of palm again - what a creative idea!,0
"I'm so glad I found this restaurant! I've been craving dumplings for too long and finally satisfied my cravings at this hole in the wall. The veggie dumplings were the best I've ever had. The dough here is thick but the fillings were great. You get 10 dumplings for $5, and they have plenty of options to satisfy everyone's cravings. You can't beat the price either!",1
"I had a great experience at Brodo, especially thanks to the friendly staff. They were able to make me a vegan combo that was perfect for me, and I really appreciate their efforts. The broth is delicious, and the atmosphere is really cozy and inviting. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great meal.",1
"I had the pleasure of dining at this adorable spot in Park Slope recently and I have to say, it was a great experience! The outside seating is really cool and inviting, and the hummus was really good - definitely one of the highlights of the meal for me. The chicken Schnitzel sandwich was also really good - the bread was a bit tough, but the chicken was really tender and flavorful. The service was a bit slow, but I understand why given the busyness of the day, and overall I thought the food was really delicious and well worth the price. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal in the Park Slope area!",1
"Came here to celebrate a belated wedding anniversary and mother's day. Booked about 3-4 weeks in advance and got myself an early dinner sitting at 5:30pm. Doors were opened at exactly 5:30pm and we were promptly seated. The decor of the restaurant was pretty nice. We ordered our dishes right away due to the ticking time machine with two young boys and luckily it was served up pretty quickly. Ordered various items:- corn fritters: deep fried, what can go wrong?- yellow rice: kids loved it and we ended up ordering more - crispy baby squid: pretty good, can't complain - chicken satay: 5 sticks in one serving, different to Indo ones I've had growing up- clams: had the Indo flavors but again, not something I grew up with - steamed cod - pretty yummy, came with asparagus as well- lobster noodles - came with plenty of lobster and was pretty yummy. Could have done with more noodles though. Unfortunately the kids started playing up so we were unable to see what the dessert menu was like. There were lots of other items on the menu we did not order however, the dishes I ordered above seemed to have been ""spicy"" for the kids which I didn't think it was? The sambal sauce that came with the squid is amazing by the way!!",0
"Came for brunch and it was very busy, I was glad we had a reservation. The service was good and the restaurant is nicely decorated, but it is small and you feel very close to the other tables. It was also exceptionally loud and it was hard to hear the people at your own table.The food was great. We started with the fried artichokes and combination platter. The sauces the artichokes came with were delicious as was everything on the platter. I would recommend both. I got the shakshuka with merguez and it was tasty, decent portion size as well. We were quite full when we left. It was a really nice meal except for the cramped seating and noise. Prices were what you would expect, not expensive, but not cheap. I would go back.",0
"Having lived in DC for a while and frequently visited the awesome Woodmont Grill (Hillstone's sister restaurant), I had very high expectations, especially from the service. Boy was I let down... A friend and I arrived on Friday night, no reservation. We were fully ready and willing to wait. We decided to stake out the (first come first served) bar area. The restaurant was packed and many were standing around the bar, patiently waiting. After 1.5 hrs of waiting, we noticed that two groups of 2 & 3 bar patrons had paid, finished their drinks and were just parked. 2 of the people were actually vaping (indoors. Yes). Not giving a shit about all those waiting, these 5 were hanging out, doing nothing, for over 45 mins (from when they fully paid). Staff was fully aware of the whole situation and didn't care to do anything about it.   After an endless wait, we finally grabbed 2 bar spots. Alas our happiness was short lived. 5 minutes later, 2 of the people who were waiting for bar seats, decided to stand 2 inches (literally) from our seats, so we had zero personal space or ability to converse. They also began having a loud convo right in our ears. We asked the staff to assist. The response: you already ordered food, so we can't move you. Angry at this point, we demanded some solution. This time the response was: we won't say anything to these people, and can move you, but it will take 25 minutes. We caved in to that preposterous response as we could not take the situation any longer. 30 mins later we moved. We were offered no compensation, no apology or even a modicum of empathy. The staff's behavior was rude beyond anything I've experienced. We simply felt humiliated. I will not return and will make sure others know not to either.",0
"Disclaimer: I've never stepped inside Zurutto, only dined in their covered outdoor area in 30 degree weather so I have no idea if the interior is as sexy as Ivan Ramen or sleek like Tonchin.  But their chicken karaage (boneless fried chicken) is the best in the borough of Manhattan that we've tasted.  We could tell that this restaurant changes their frying oil often because the chicken so crispy outside and moist inside, not greasy at all.  Their homemade gyoza dumplings taste like oba-chan cooked them and their miso ramen is dream-inducing.  The charred pork is tender and caramelized and LITERALLY melts in your mouth like butter or foie gras (without the ducky goose taste).  The broth oozes umami and you want to lap it up from the bowl like Fido.  We also ordered the Truffle Mazeman Noodles which has a spicy kick that obscures the truffle.  I caught a whiff of the truffle oil when the bowl was placed in front of me but quickly forgot that flavor eating it.  The cheesiness (yes cheese) added another flavor and it felt very rich, indulgent and filling.  But the Miso Ramen is our fave and we're lying in bed hungering for some.  It's such a treat to have a legit ramen place like Zurutto in the UWS.NOTE:  Do not order the mochi ice cream dessert.  The mochi exterior was hard and had freezer burn.  Just walk down the block to Trader Joe's and pick up a box of their mochi ice cream (matcha, strawberry, vanilla or chocolate peanut butter flavors).",0
"Mokyo is the sister restaurant to Thursday Kitchen, but I definitely enjoyed Thursday Kitchen more.  The food here was delicious, but the portions are extremely small for the price.  I know they serve tapas, but I think I could have used a little more in each plate.  The best dish here was the Octopus with Rice.  That is definitely a must get, and the most worth it.  The ribs are also very good - fall off the bone, juicy, and flavorful.  The corn dumplings are sweet and creamy with a little citrusy kick to them - delicious!  Every dish is very creative and delicious.  I just wish the portions were a bit bigger.  Definitely come here if you want just a snack, not a meal.",0
"I ordered the Dim Sum Combo A and added on the steamed dragon rice rolls and the salted egg yolk lava buns. While the standouts were the crispy shrimp roll (from the combo) and the two add-on extras (dragon rice rolls and lava buns), everything was excellent.I've been hearing of comparisons to Tim Ho Wan, especially with the baked BBQ pork bun, which here at Awesum was a tad sweet- could be dessert and could use more pork.Menu is large and takes a modern spin on some traditional dim sum items, especially with the variety of the steamed rice rolls. The customer service needs improvement. The staff was pleasant but ignorant. Perhaps the dialogue with masks on contributed to miscommunication. It might be easier (and best) to order online for takeout. But check to make sure your order is correct. Overall I would definitely revisit and try the other items on the menu (and repeat the lava buns). For sure I would opt for take out and not eat outside again... one Siu Mai rolled off when a gust of wind blew through; and the dishes got cold quick. Tip: if you want pictures, you could probably tell staff you'd like to take pictures with your order and ask for your order in the steam containers. Take your pictures then pack your food to go in the takeout containers.",0
"Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at Criollas Empanadas. The takeout box arrived safely and intact, and the three empanadas (chicken, caprese, and creamy corn) all tasted great. I did find one minor issue with the creamy corn empanada, though. The flaky layers of pastry just fell apart easily, making it difficult to eat without utensils. Otherwise, everything was delicious. I would definitely order from here again!",1
"I visited this restaurant for dim sum and I have to say that it was not my favorite. The servers were really pushy and brought us the same thing over and over again even when we said we didn't want anymore. The dim sum itself was fairly satisfactory, but it was made fresh which meant that we had to wait longer. Overall, the pushy service was much more aggressive than other locations and I wouldn't recommend it.",1
"I can't believe I am just not writing a review for Rare because it is truly one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. It doesn't hurt that both the restaurant and I are located in Murray Hill, but semantics...My reasoning for the 5 stars is that the food is fabulous and the prices are amazing for NYC. They also have a real happy hour at the bar every day from 5-7, which is RARE in New York. It is worth noting, though, that everything is a la carte, but so are most places in NYC.An absolute must-get if you like seafood is the lobster burger. It is 100% hot lobster (no mayo and veggies like a lobster roll) and comes with the delicious Mexican corn and melted butter to dip your burger in. That being said, I have tried numerous burgers here and all of them have been fabulous. I brought my parents here once-they're very picky- and they loved it as well. I've also tried the French fry basket, which comes with what looks like 5 lbs of their cottage, sweet potato, and regular fries with a myriad of dipping sauces. The cottage fries are a MUST-GET. It's shaped like a waffle fry and has the seasoning of a curly fry.I would be remiss if I left out that during one of my more recent trips to Rare, we looked behind the booth for an outlet for my friend's charger, and we saw a mouse trap. As any New Yorker knows, mice are veryyyy common, and I'm not sure why it was there (hoping as a preventative measure), but honestly I still give Rare 5 stars.",0
"We came before the Matinee show for brunch.It was a very hot summer day and teh front Windows were open. Gladly, we were sated inside where it was well air-conditioned, so that was good start when you have both options available for you.Bloody Mary was very tasteful, spicy but it came served I a room temp, in spite of all the ice in it. Don't the bartender know rule #1 of vodka (which he wasn't shy with)? Keep it in freezer (or at least refrigerator) and shake it well with lots of ice before mixing! And so is the bloody mix-refrigerated. Steak and egg was good but medium rare steak came out more  medium and very chewy. Breakfast taco salad was small but tasty. Service was VERY good, pleasant, friendly, attentive. Hence the 4th star.",0
Tacos - 8/10The meat on these tacos were super flavor! Points deducted cause it was $4 a taco and I wish it was bigger Consome - 7/10I love soups in all forms so this was right up my alley. There was a good amount if meat and good flavor. Esquites - 4/10 I would pass on this next time. It was too salty and nothing specialTostadas - 7/10Love the crunch of a tostadas but I think I'm more soft shell than hard shellMulitas - 8/10Love the meat and the cheese! Think I perfer the taco because it's less messy but still delicious!,0
"After hearing that the Au Cheval Diner produces the best burgers in Chicago, I decided to try out the New York sister restaurant and hope for the best.I made a reservation (that I had to change once I got there - I was early or late... I don't recall). They were highly accommodating. While waiting for our table, my group and I were chatting when all of a sudden, a random man leans in and asks ""are you guys ready?"" Perhaps he should have introduced himself and let us know that he works at Au Cheval because we were thrown off and startled. He seated us promptly and our waiter took our orders. I was a bit on the fence about some items, but the waiter ensured us that the ""bacon was LIT"". Upon first bite of the juicy burger, I was underwhelmed. There was no strong umami taste that would normally have me put down the burger and sink down into the seat because my taste buds went into overdrive. This burger wasn't too far off from Shake Shack (which admittedly, I do love, but not for this price). It's a better option to order a side of bacon for the table if you're going with a group. Add an egg, if that's your thing. This place is exorbitantly overpriced. I ordered the burger with a side of fries and bacon for the table. I also got the ""draught"" (draft) root beer for $6. All together, this ended up being about $40 per person, for a burger, a small but thick slab of bacon, fries, and a soda. While my taste buds were moderately happy, my wallet was not.New York is a far way from Chicago. And so it seems, the quality is also far from Chicago's standard.",0
"Snagged a reservation for 4 at around 5pm on a Saturday, didn't actually get seated until close to 5:30. That table by the door got pretty drafty so they were more than gracious to let us move when another table opened up. Got the tartiflette, mac and cheese, and the New York for 2 with their house raclette and then the porcini afterwards. Pros: TastyPrompt with serviceAble to split the bill how we requested (one of our group had ordered wine while the rest of us did not etc etc)Affordable at ~$30ppCons:Cheese could've been hotter, seemed like it re-solidified soon after it hit the foodThe mac and cheese was made with tiny pasta? Not really a con but not really the pasta shape I was expectingNot for the lactose intolerant",0
"I was not impressed with my visit to this restaurant. The ordering of pizza was fine, but the pickup for pizza was confusing and not organized well at all. They should have a designated spot behind the counter where you can grab your slice. The pizza dough is a sourdough which is not my favorite for pizza. The sourdough flavor is too intrusive and doesn't let the sauce or toppings to speak for themselves. Overall, not great. I would not return here.",1
"Shukette has quite a bit of hype built around it - and for good reason. It has a funky indoor vibe along with extensive outdoor seating...all with some great cuisine to relish.Our server was quite helpful and knowledgeable and guided our group of four through a few different dietary restrictions. In all, we got the orange wine (great recommendation...try a taste to confirm you'd like it) and a few of the ""Gazoz"" options (essentially spritz-like cocktails). All were great drinks if that's what you're into.As for the food: We had the bessara, khachapuri, crisply squash blossoms, pea party, crispy artichokes, and Arctic char meatballs. All were great. We were especially glad that we got the bessara (not a dip you'd find in many Middle Eastern restaurants) and the pea party (interesting combination of greens that tasted better than that implied by the description). The crispy tapas were delectable as well (after all, it's hard to go wrong when it's fried!)Note: Reserve in advance...this place books up quickly.",0
"I have to start with describing their namesake dish, Mafaldini - Shrimp Scampi. It just stands out from every other shrimp scampi I've ever had. There's great crunch from the shrimp and generous amount of bread crumbs, a little citrus from the lemon juice and the pasta is satisfying (definitely Al dente).   The shrimp could be in slightly bigger pieces, but other than that I can't say enough good things about the dish. The Tuna crudo was excellent as well, but was on the small side even for an appetizer. But overall it had a nice flavor profile.The Octopus was delicious as well, I wouldn't change anything about the dish, aside from maybe needing to order 2 of them. Both times I ordered it, they were completely different sizes.Panna cotta was a nice way to finish off the meal, the watermelon was a refreshing touch. The decor is modern and beautiful, would recommend stopping by for dinner if you're in the area. I had a great experience both times I visited! I plan on trying the red snapper or the yellowtail crudo on my next visit.",0
"I used to come her regularly when I worked in the area and loved it. I was surprised at the marginal reviews when I was in the area, but I was feening for the red pepper hummus. The menu has changed and my ""go to"" meal was no longer clearly on the menu (I may have been able to put it together, but that seemed too costly). I settled for the hummus I came for without the bowl option I used to get. The hummus was satisfying with the warm pita, as before. My biggest complaint is that it was over $10 for only that without a drink. While I still enjoyed my meal, I am disappointed that the menu is confusing and the cost for a complete meal is now over $15. Never mind a beverage. For that reason, I give it 4 stars, though prefer 3.5, which is not selectable. So I round up. Again, my meal was delicious, but I didn't have a drink. They may do better to make the menu clearer and making it more affordable to attract more business.",0
"Anton's had me feeling good after a long day. The prices are more reasonable than most places in the area, and the food is fresh and tasty. I recommend making a reservation, as brunch seems to be reverting back to its normal unflagging self pre-pandemic. The chairs leave unflattering indentations on the back of your thighs, but the restroom is open to customers.",1
"I just had the best meal at this restaurant! The pasta is so fresh and amazing. I typically order delivery or pick it up. Ignore what people say about the portions. The to go container is a huge cylinder and I can't eat it in a sitting, I have plenty left over. The people are so friendly and food is reasonably priced and good. Love the carbonara, the garlic one, mushroom pasta too. I've had bites of the others too. Nothing disappointing ever.",1
I'd rate Valerie four and a half stars.We stopped in to watch some college basketball and grab a few drinks after dining elsewhere. We promptly grabbed some seats at the bar and placed some drink orders. I selected a tomatillo infused mezcal cocktail which was excellent. I'd highly recommend it. I had a couple more glasses of mezcal afterwards. Our bartender was very attentive and accommodating. We stuck around for so long that we decided to order some snacks as well. We ordered crispy shrimp and cauliflower. Both were delicious.,0
"Just had lunch here today. We sat outside waiting for the restaurant to open, along with another customer. They opened for lunch at 11:31. I noticed her take out the closed for business laminated sign. Instead of coming out to welcome us and let us know they are open, she did nothing. They could clearly see from the inside. When I walked in to use the restroom before we were seated, the other employee just stood against the wall without saying hello or a smile.  He just looked so unhappy being there.  Where do they get these people who work here?The food was fine. My partner ordered Duck Ssäm, which he loved.  I had the Brisket Okonomiyaki.  This dish was too strange. The brisket was very good, but not as part of Okonomiyaki. For me, service is so tied into my experience of a restaurant. There are so many other options. I would not come back.",0
This seems like a classic New York slice. The artichoke and spinach white pie hit the spot. $7.89 or so for both slices.,0
"We came here once during COVID and it was originally a lackluster experience, but now they seem to have stepped up their game! Last time our portions were small and in disposable containers, but this time we definitely got our money's worth. For food we got the large chips and guacamole, it came in two little buckets which I thought were very cute. Plenty of chips and a huge portion of guac which was so tasty. I also got a mojito and it was absolutely delicious, I definitely recommend. For my main I got the steak nachos and they were SO GOOD. The steak was cooked perfect and everything was warm, fresh, and delicious. The portion was huge, my only suggestion is I wish there was more toppings, I had plenty of plain chips under all this! Either way, still super good.Overall, our server was very nice, albeit a little slow but it was Saturday night. We will definitely be coming back, the food is so worth it",0
"I absolutely love Boqueria - it's my go-to restaurant in Times Square! The food is great, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the service is always polite and attentive. I especially love the lunch menu - there's something for everyone here, and I've never been disappointed. My favorite dishes include the patatas bravas, the berza salad, the Barcelona bowl, and of course, their churros! Sometimes the restaurant can get really busy during lunch on the weekdays, so I recommend making a reservation - and don't forget to order dessert!",1
I stopped in at this restaurant for a quick beer on a spring afternoon and was really impressed! The window seating provided a great view of the city and the service was friendly and accommodating. I ordered a few IPAs and a few flatbreads and was really happy with everything. I especially enjoyed the prosciutto fig flatbread - it was delicious! I'm definitely going to be back!,1
"Another great spot for solo dining or take-out, either way, the food is delicious and with such affordable prices, it's definitely worth getting! I got the boat noodles, a dish I had in Bangkok before. The difference was MAKIINNY's has a medium spice level (which for a weak spice eater was still bearable enough to finish) and was much richer in the broth flavor. Slurping the noodles coated with the spicy pork soup really hit the spot on a cold day. I also loved the pork balls and make sure to let the crispy pork rinds soak in the broth to enjoy. There was a lot of dry pork meat but the soup helps. I was contently full after finishing and felt so warm that I did not need to zip up my jacket after walking back out in the 30 degrees weather. Also as the only solo diner on that day, I enjoyed listening to the workers chatting amongst themselves in Thai. Didn't need Thai music or decorations to feel like I was in Thailand. The store itself isn't large enough to fit big groups for in-store dining but they do have seats outside. This is a spot I'll definitely come back for Thai food again!",0
Ordered take our here via caviar. I had the murgh tikka masala- which was good. The flavor was awesome I did think the chicken was maybe a little bit dry. I also had the chili topped naan which was good.,0
"I come here a lot (at least once or twice a week) and really like some of the items on their menu, such as the lavender latte, chocolate chunk cookie, and papa's breakfast bowl. Their staff has also been very nice in the past, but that seems to no longer be the case. When I was waiting for my Ritual order to be prepared, it was taking a bit longer than usual (30 minutes), and most of the staff was nice about it, but one waitress by the name of Gabby or Maddie was very rude and wouldn't let me sit down, citing that ""this is a full on restaurant"" as if I was of a different class because I had ordered ahead. When I explained that I was planning on dining in but had ordered ahead to avoid the wait, she accused me of ""being hostile"" to her, which was absolutely ridiculous. It really wasn't the experience or level of service that I've come to expect of the Maman chain.",0
"I was really looking forward to trying Holy Schnitzel, as I love chicken cutlet sandwiches and wraps. However, my experience was not great. The chicken portions were ridiculously small, and the vegetables and dressing came in very small portions. This place turned out to be a tremendous disappointment. I will never buy anything from here again. I hope they change their business practices, or get pushed to the dirt by the better options that inhabit the Manhattan area.",1
"Dutch Fred's is a great place to go for a casual meal. The past few times I've come to Manhattan and used Yelp to find places to eat and/or drink, Dutch Fred's has been regularly displayed, plus several of my local Yelp friends had written very favorable reviews. I took this as an indication that I needed to visit it sometime, which I finally did over the past weekend. It was indeed worth it and a very enjoyable experience.

I had already reviewed their menus online, but when we arrived, we discovered that they were still featuring their St. Patrick's Day menu for a bit beyond St. Patrick's Day, with some additional options. We took them up on this and added the corned beef and cabbage croquettes and shepherd's pie empanadas to our order. These were unique, a little filling, but otherwise well prepared and tasty. We changed continents for the rest of our food order, adding pork belly bao buns (some of the best we've ever had), and chicken mole tacos (a spin I'd not ever had and equally enjoyable). Our cocktails were along the more traditional side but at the same level of quality. We had quite a few servers and staff taking care of us, adding something,",1
"Came here for a group dinner, whilst the service by Andy our waitress was great, but what messed it up was it was so hot, the Ac didn't work indoors so we sat outside in 92 degree weather, and they had no fan. Dessert was good. Food was mediocre.",0
"I found this place by accident and I'm glad I did. The prices are really reasonable and the sushi is really good. I tried the salmon, amber jack and scallop, and they were all really great. I was really surprised that I liked the fish more than the uni. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi.",1
"I have never been Southern Hospitality BBQ before.  So my friend picked this place to meet with another friend. The drink what I had was really good and strong enough. However they need mor servers. It took a lot of time to get our drinks and food. The location of the restaurant was really good I had crispy chicken tenders which it was so delicious and we order tater tots as well.  As a desert we had banana pudding which is was outstanding and bread pudding was so good. I believe if they increase their staff, it will be much better.",0
"3.5* Le Botaniste is a beautiful spot to grab a vegan/vegetarian lunch in Midtown, but given the price point I can't see this being an every day option for most people who work in the area.  Prices are steep when compared to nearby options.I had the Tibetan Mama and was skeptical about PB being used in the curry but you can barely taste it.  The dish is hearty, super flavorful, and healthy.   I enjoyed it, but finished the whole thing and totally regretted it after because it was really filling.We saw that they charged $$$$ for an avocado that was dipped/coated in super seeds.  Seemed a bit ridiculous, but to each their own...",0
"The 干炒牛河 (dry fried beef noodles) here are a decent dish, with a nice flavor and a fresh taste. However, the dish can be a little pricey, and the beef can sometimes ooze a cheese-like substance after being microwaved. Overall, I think this is a solid option for a quick meal in a city like New York.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was great and the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend it to others. The only downside was that the butter was very cold and difficult to spread, but that may just be my opinion.",1
"Came here for lunch recently with a friend with high hopes for a stellar bowl of ramen based on the high yelp rating. While the service was very good, unfortunately, the miso pork ramen I got was quite average even dare I say it? Bland. I added a lot of the hot garlic topping to try to amp to the flavor but I'm afraid to say I would not come back as there are many better ramen options in the city.",0
"Had a great time and great food at Laut! My boyfriend made a reservation a week in advanced, and good thing he did, because it was very crowded when we got there. We were seated after a short wait, and then had to wait quite a bit of time before someone came to take our order for our appetizer. I didn't mind though, as the restaurant was very busy and I wasn't really in a rush. We ordered the Singapura cocktail and Roti Telur to start. The cocktail was great - strong and the flavors were nice too. The Roti was delicious and flavorful. As an entree, my boyfriend ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice and was blown away. He's usually a quick eater, but he ate it slow to savor all of the flavors hahah and it was also a generous portion. I ordered the Mamak Mee Goreng without the shrimp fritter, and it was delicious - flavorful, tangy, and generous portion as well! Overall the food was great and the service was quick besides when we first arrived. We would definitely come back and try other things on the menu!",0
I had a fantastic experience at Club A! The steak was cooked perfectly and the service was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,1
"I had a great time at Rosella's! The specialty pizzas were really unique and I loved the eggplant parm slice. It was really fresh and had a great flavor. The only downside was that the slices were a bit cold when I got them, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"There's so many revered pizza places, and this was on my list. Coming inside, it feels more like a bar than someplace to get upscale pizza. It goes more for the nyc hangout spot vibe and I think that's why it experiments with a dish so unique as pastrami pizza. I heard that was a fan favorite, and when I tried it I really enjoyed it. Rather than you're normal red sauce, they have a mustard sauce as well. Having this pizza just shows that pastrami  can be good on anything. Maybe it was the how novel it was, but I enjoyed it a lot more than other salty meat toppings (Prosciutto). You have this really heavy, salty meat, on some mustard to balance it, and then some dough to help make the bites not that heavy (the exact makeup of a pastrami sandwich).We got some other pies like margarita, but the other ones weren't as memorable.",0
Jajaja is a vegan restaurant that I have been a fan of for a while now. The interior is beautiful and they have plenty of seating options. The service is always great and the food is amazing! I have tried a variety of items here and they all are really good. The portions are really large and the price is really affordable. I highly recommend Jajaja to anyone looking for a great vegan dining experience!,1
"I thought the food here was good, but not great. We started with the meatballs which were amazing and I definitely recommend. We also ordered the burata which was good, but pretty standard. Additionally we ordered the arugula and artichoke salad, but there really wasn't much flavor. We then shared the lasagna which was good, but a little too much meat inside for me. Lastly, we split the margherita pizza which was just ok. I liked that it was brick oven but there was something really sweet tasting (maybe the sauce?). Overall, it was a good dinner but not sure I would come back.",0
"I visited this restaurant with some friends from a hosting class. The food was ""meh"" but the service has always been polite, so that's good. The games they have on TV are a nice touch, and the bathroom could have used some paper towels, but it wasn't a big deal. It's also close to the subway station, so it's easy to get to.",1
"Have come here w groups, and 1:1 w my partner or a girlfriend. It never disappoints. Just plan your meal accordingly because some of the tapas can be filling (and they're not cheap!), and the paella is a minimum of 2 servings. Love the Socarrat, black squid ink and vegetarian one. I love when they have mushroom croquettes (for vegetarians) but they also have plenty of vegetarian tapas and a vegetarian paella. Didn't get it this time but the gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp), octopus, and papas (potatoes) are delicious! Yummy wine and sangria selection too.",0
"This may be a bit bias because we had a private room to ourselves and I didn't pay for the meal. It is a bit pricey but that's because it's Daniel freaking Boulud. Let's be honest here. For appetiser, I got the foie gras, which is absolutely amazing. For main course, I got the duck, which again, yes, amazing. Sorry, I'm American, I'm just going to say amazing a lot. Maybe magnifique is more your style? And for dessert, I got the chocolate molten style cake and it was so good. If I could have one per week, I'd die a happy woman.My friends all loved everything they ordered from the steak to the soups and onward.  The service was so good albeit slow since we had a private room. There were times, they would duck out so we couldn't find them. But otherwise, we were very pleased. The sommelier was very helpful in picking out the perfect wine within the price range I wanted. Absolutely amazing.I look forward to going again some time. And hopefully, treated by someone else again. Hah!",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good but not great. The chicken doro wat was particularly tasty, but I thought the gomey (collared greens/spinach) was bland. The meats themselves were OK but nothing special. The service was slow, and we had to ask for water refills every time. However, with better options around, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1
I noticed most of the staff behind the counter looked grumpy and miserable. So I have concerns my coffee would put me in a grumpier mood than I was already In. It may be called Cafe Grumpy but it's sure was a happy cup of coffee. It was very tasty. They do need to expand the menu. Very limited and they need to add hazelnut to the menu.,0
"Decided to check this place out with a friend for NY restaurant week! I thought it was interesting that the restaurant itself was inside Macy's on the 6th floor. Interior of the place was very open with a nice bar area (good place to have a drink or two after you finish your shopping).We started off with some cocktails, where we tried their Aperol Spritz to cool down for the summer. Then, we decided to order from the restaurant week menu. I decided to order the Gnocchi Napoletana, Pollo Milanese and Tiramisu. The appetizer and entrée tasted good, but i feel like my chicken could've used more sauce for topping. Also our server forgot about our dessert so we almost missed it, but was able to take it to go.Overall, my experience here was not too bad, if you're looking for a quick dine in spot after you finish your shopping. I would probably come back to hang out by the bar next time because their cocktails were pretty good!",0
"I visited the restaurant a few times and it's definitely not all hype. The wait times can be long, but it's worth it for the delicious food. The service is always polite and not pushy, and the prices are reasonable. The only downside is that the tables are small and uncomfortable, but that's to be expected in a packed house. The wine options are mediocre, but the burger is definitely worth trying. The Brussels sprouts are also ok, but I found myself dipping them in mustard. Overall, a decent restaurant that's worth a visit.",1
I was really disappointed with my last visit the food and drinks were sup par and it was Cinco De Mayo.  I was really not impressed the place seems to have gone down and forget the bathrooms looks like a gas station rest stop smh.  I'm not sure I'll be going back I had my 30th birthday there and service food and ambiance was way better but hey that was over a decade ago so who knows what happened since then,0
"Came here around 1 pm on a weekday to grab a few slices for lunch! There was a sizeable line but it moved quickly. I'd heard a lot about their famous square pepperoni slices and seen so many pictures on foodie accounts, so I knew what I was going to order but I didn't really see a clear menu anywhere in the store about all of their other offerings (maybe I just missed it though). Each of the pepperoni slices was $5.50, and even though they look relatively small, they're super filling. They definitely don't skimp on the pepperoni and I enjoyed how there was an extra spicy kick to it. Plus the shape of the pepperoni cups is just very amusing to me. The dough was very airy but still crispy on the edges (since they heat up your slices right after you order) and I loved their tomato sauce - the texture of everything combined was great! The only down side is that the slices are super greasy, since oil can even collect within the pepperoni lol. The place itself is very small and there isn't any indoor seating. They take both cash and card.",0
"I found a new lunch spot! Market Crates. Forget about Just Salad or Chop't. This little gem delivers first class service without the assembly line wait.

Tucked in the middle of the block on 35th Street, Market Crates has much to offer. Different stations for different cravings: soups, sandwiches, salads and more.

As soon as you enter, it not only smells good but is immaculate. I keep reading about their delicious coffee which I'll definitely have to try.

On this first time visit, I was in the mood for salad. Pick your greens. Then protein (shrimp is additional $2.50). Select 3 premium ingredients. Finally, 6 additional toppings--that's 10 toppings in all, for a total of $14.14.

The staff is super nice. There is a great variety of delicious, fresh lunch selections and the prices are reasonable. I read they also serve breakfast.

Sweet.",1
"I love how many different slice options this place has. I placed my first order yesterday and chose 4 different slices although it was pretty hard to choose. I went with the margarita, artichoke, buffalo chicken, and vodka sauce. Off the bat I'd say my favorite was the vodka sauce. I finished that and the margarita slice along with half the artichoke and half the buffalo chicken slices. The artichoke and buffalo chicken are very heavy and they did NOT skimp on the toppings! So today I heated up the rest of the artichoke slice and buffalo chicken slice in the toaster oven and they tasted just as good as yesterday... I'll definitely be ordering from here again, I just have to remind myself that if I'm going to order certain slices, they'll be very filling (which is not a bad thing, just something to keep in mind). I'm excited to try different slices next time but I'll probably get the vodka sauce one again regardless. My only complaint is that when the slices arrived they were kind of all over the place and overlapping. Also they weren't really hot, but that  obviously didn't stop me from enjoying them.",0
This is a great breakfast place! My husband got the soft scrambled eggs and we ordered a side of avocado for $5 but it was worth it! I got the green juice - tasted very fresh and delicious. I also ordered the giner shot and it was huge!We sat at the bar and we had great service from Keisha and the atmosphere was great! I would highly recommend this spot!!,0
"I had a great experience at Mom's Kitchen & Bar! Justin and Kianna were our servers and they were both on top of things. They were always smiling and happy, which made my day. I would definitely come back and hope to see them both again.",1
"This restaurant is conveniently located right off the subway line, a fact which you are reminded of while dinIng. As you sit, you will feel the occasional rumble below your feet. It's not the worst rumble I've felt, but it's definitely present.I wanted to love this restaurant, but I just didn't. I had seen so many Instagram bloggers post about the spaghetti carbonara here and couldn't wait to try it myself, so I came here right at opening to grab lunch before my afternoon flight. I was the first restaurant patron of the day and was seated after the waiter fumbled around for a minute or so to get the correct menu. It was almost as if he were surprised to have someone come in when they had posted they were open. I ordered fairly quickly since my mind had been decided before I even got there, but then overheard a waiter telling a nearby table the daily specials....daily specials which had not been offered to me. Some sounded good and I would have actually considered them if I had been offered, but I hadn't been.The spaghetti carbonara was good, but not amazing. The pasta was well cooked, the egg was perfectly runny, but I didn't find the flavor to be very rich. Don't get me wrong, I ate it all...but wouldn't return for $24 pasta I didn't find amazing. I was also perturbed that I didn't really get attentive service, or any service at all. First, I didn't receive the specials. Then I was barely acknowledged during my dining experience despite there only being two other tables filled. Other than taking my order, giving me my food and taking my money, I really didn't have much interaction with anyone. All I know is there are far better places with far better service that I should be giving my money to.",0
"Soba Totto is pretty meh soba in my opinion and with the new management cutting down on portion sizes to try to increase their profit margins, I'm not really sure if I would be back unless someone was very insistent about it. There are a lot of better Japanese restaurants in the area.",0
"I had a great time at Big Flavors, Tender Meats and Tender Poultry! The friendly staff was great and the food was delicious. The Chicken Stew with Mangu y Pepper Steak with Rice and Beans was my favorite dish - it was really flavorful and tender. The Goat Stew was also really good, and I loved the Tender Beef Stew. The Fried Chicken Breast was also great, and the prices were affordable under $10. Overall, I had a great time and I would definitely recommend Big Flavors, Tender Meats and Tender Poultry to others.",1
"I ordered the pork belly bao and the crispy chicken bao at Baohaus. The only redeeming part of that meal was the pork belly - seasoned well, fatty, and just what I was looking for. The only thing I disliked about that bao was the pickled mustard greens, which could have been omitted. The fried chicken bao was SO bad - dry and chicken, plain mayo, the entire thing was dry, dry, dry. I really love Super Taste for their pork belly baos, if I were to come back to Baohaus I'd get ONLY the pork belly bao, sans pickled mustard greens.",1
"I had a great experience at Dock's Restaurant! The space is large and open, but usually it's fairly busy, so I'm not positive you'll be able to get a table. The quality of the food was really good and the prices were fair. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I came here with a group around 1 on a Saturday and had no wait! The food was delicious and I thought the servers were hilarious, although I can see why some yelpers thought they were rude. The pappardelle special and truffle pasta were big hits. Also note the ATM was broke, but there is an Apple bank across the street to grab cash for the bill. I knocked off a star due to cash only and it being a tad pricier than I would have liked.",1
"I visited this restaurant after they opened up their indoor dining area. The table and hand sanitizers were in full effect, and everyone was wearing masks. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and the potatoes underneath were surprising my favorite part. Nothing crazy spectacular, but overall a good experience.",1
I wanted to like this place but at $8.15 for 6 pan fried dumplings- I have to be honest. I ordered the classic with pork and shrimp.  However the flavors or umami was very lacking - shrimp usually yields a certain umami to the food it is in!! These however were lacking in flavor - I know that there is shrimp from the texture but that's all!,0
"Sprawling all over the city and serving up its beautifully packaged and well made pastries is Paris Baguette. While certain locations may only have pastries, some have a sandwich section for people to grab quick lunches from. This particular location is right in Times Square and is quite convenient for those working in the area for their morning coffee and pastries.My personal favorites include their mini croissants (perfect for snacking throughout the day!), Mr. Bear (a chocolate cake in the shape of a bear), and their chocolate croissants. You can also download their app if you are a frequent visitor to rack up points for rewards! The only drawback is that their items tend to be on the pricier side. For example, their Mr. Bear which is like a 3x1 inch cake cost around $2.75. Not terrible for NYC but definitely pricier than what you can find at other places for sure.",0
"We really enjoyed celebrating my boyfriend's birthday at Gabriel Kreuther, the food was really amazing and their service was spectacular.I made the reservation about 2 weeks in advance. My boyfriend walked away feeling spoiled by one of the few fine dining indoor experiences he encountered. The staff were thoughtful and there was a note prepared for us when we got there. We were sat promptly and they offered us some of the bread and spread (chef aumont) and then we also got an amuse bouche from when we arrived.Next we decided to order a la carte instead because there were a few things we didn't quite like from the prix fixe menu (very good value, 3 course for below $100 and just over $100 for 4 courses).We ordered the signature smoked sturgeon and sauerkraut tart which was smaller imagined but very delicious with the thin soufflé exterior. We also ordered the hamachi crudo which you pair with some sort of chip which was also quite delicious .We then got our main courses which from reviews, the miso prime strip steak and the duck breast were the most highly rated- so good! I loved the duck the best because the duck fat just melted off of the crispy skin with each bite. They forgot our side order of polenta so they took that off our Bill and even gave us complimentary fries to make up for it.Then for dessert we got a fig carpaccio which was very unique and so delicate and crispy. They then came out to surprise us with a dessert with a candle and they even wrote happy birthday for my boyfriend which was also a complimentary dish. To finish they brought out a few chocolates and two mini mandarin cheesecake bites. Very sweet experience. I highly recommend for anyone wanting to celebrate their birthday! Best of all, after feeling extremely stuffed at a 2 star Michelin restaurant the bill was $250 before after tax which is very reasonable.",0
"Sorry, but if your restaurant is completely empty you can let me sit down even if I ordered from the express area. I understand policies but if you're going to be so rigorous, then understand when I can't recommend this particular artichoke.To further justify the low score, pizza was cold. If you want to try a decent artichoke slice, try a different location.",0
"I'm so glad the pandemic didn't shut down this fine establishment. Still serving interesting and well-executed mod asian food, with that still wonderfully complex mezcal drink (secret ingredient szechuan peppercorn). The carpaccio and cauliflower were new for me; and the cauliflower (3-ways: pickled, grilled, pureed) might be my new favorite dish. Yes I will come back again.1. Beef Carpaccio (jujube, tendon, cilantro)2. Everything Brioche(trout, miso yolk, roe)3. Cauliflower(yuzukoshō, sesame, black garlic)4. XLB Agnolotti(pork, truffle, black vinegar)5. Lobster 3-Ways(sticky rice, scallion ginger, s+p claw)6. Oaxaca Forever(Mezcal, Beet, Ginger)",0
"The restaurant had a cute dining room, nothing spectacular but spaced apart for Covid restrictions. We were very comfortable and I know some had mentioned being cold, we were not. We tried a couple of things and were glad we did. The steak was delicious, so tender and cooked perfectly! The gambas al ajillo were so yummy, I don't normally eat lamb but theirs was good! The only hiccup we had was with a dish but the manager quickly came to the rescue. I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"Soogil definitely has a romantic atmosphere, perfect for a special occasion like Valentine's Day. The dishes we tried were all delicious, but the Chilean Sea Bass was especially noteworthy. The crispy crust on top was a great addition and really made the dish stand out. The portions were also very reasonable, which was great. However, we were a bit disappointed with the overall indoor environment. It was incredibly cold in there, and we even needed to put on our coats and scarves while we were eating.",1
"I really enjoyed my experience at Tri Dim Shanghai. The takeout arrived quickly and everything was neatly arranged in a small ziplock bag - very clean and professional. The shrimp fried rice tasted great and all of the shrimp were deveined - something I appreciate. However, I was disappointed with the fortune cookie - it was very stale and I couldn't even taste the chocolate. All in all, an enjoyable experience!",1
"Tri Dim West is a great place for a casual meal. The decor is nice, but not as nice as East Side restaurant. The service was very accommodating. The food was a bit uneven. The soup dumplings were excellent. The spare ribs were meh. The prawns in XO sauce were awesome. The braised beef was underwhelming, managing to be bland and spicy at the same time. Solid place, we may have ordered wrong. We're sticking with the 3rd avenue restaurant.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The lunch special was great, and I really enjoyed the all you can eat Indian buffet. The buffet was definitely worth the price, and I was able to refill my plate twice. The service was great, and the atmosphere was comfortable and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
I had a great experience at Sushi Nonaka. The sushi was very fresh and they brought out 3 pieces at a time. I can't wait to come back and try them out at the sushi bar.,1
"I always think of this place as a hidden jewel because it never seems overly busy and the food is always spot on delicious with reasonable prices, the latter being a rarity in the Chelsea/Flatiron area.The food is Shanghainese, which for most people usually translate to the Chinese food they are used to ... or at least it's close to it. But truth be told traditional Shanghai cuisine is hard to get right, and this place does.It's very mom and pop, which is part of its charm. The older gentleman who seats patrons and takes orders is the owner. His wife, who speaks little to no English, is the head chef. We've been coming here for awhile and the food is always consistently good. And I don't say that often. NYC is infamous for its inconsistencies. The dry pot is a treat. Grandma's dumplings are one of their more sought after and famous dishes. The farmhouse dumplings is a unique dish for the egg lover.Never disappoints.",0
"The first time we were there we had a very good time. This time, however, we had a completely different experience. For starter we chose the polipo alla griglia which was great. The special pizza, the tartufo, on the other hand, would have been good but tasted like detergent!! (I have no idea where that detergent taste came from given that they don't sanitize anything during this period, which is also a bit disconcerting during times of Covid.) I pointed this out to our server who at first didn't want to understand what I was talking about, then he just grabbed our plates and left without saying anything. It was weird. It was also a bit off-putting as the owner went around to greet all his friends at other tables, but he didn't even look at us or asked whether we liked everything or not... The entire lunch was rather disappointing, especially because previously we had a good time there so we naturally expected more. Now I don't feel like going back.",0
"Amazing yakitori! This is one of my favorite places for skewers. My favorites are the chicken thighs and shishito peppers. I like them salted. It can come with tare sauce too. They have a good amount of choices for drinks. There are happy hour drink specials Mon-Thurs from 5-7pm.The restaurant is down the stairs. Small and cozy and with bar seating. Inside can get noisy and the music is running, but is good if you don't want to overhear the next tables over talking. They also have a decent sized outdoor seating area on the street. Outdoors seems more quiet and has more lighting. The ambiance indoors is dimmer lighting and can be romantic.The staff are nice and friendly. Although sometimes it gets really busy, probably around 7-9pm prime dinner time, so you'd have to try to catch the staff attention if you want to get something. They do look when you wave, so it wasn't a long wait at all.",0
"I did not try their ramen here, so I can't attest to how good or bad it is. I tried the Spicy Tuna Sashimi Bowl and while it tasted good, I was disappointed in the lack of creativity and variety in the dish. It was basically just a ton of rice and then tuna sashimi and some spring onions. I would've expected there to be other toppings to provide different flavors and textures. My friend did enjoy the ramen here, so maybe I will try that if I ever come back.",0
Can't get enough of this amazing cafe! They sweet options are without refined sugar. How amazing is that! I stopped by twice this past weekend. Had banana waffles with blueberry compote and coconut cream. It was so delicious I could probably eat 5 of them. The amount of blueberries is also generous compared to all other brunch places. It's made with maple syrup so no bad refined sugar used! We also had the BLT sandwich which had crispy trumpet mushroom and was full of Imani flavor! I also enjoyed the vegan best LES breakfast sandwich.,0
"Friends and I popped in real fast in between meetings, had some delicious ramen. Wait time wasn't too bad either! Very easy to pop in and out",0
"It's my favorite restaurant,  the sushi is fresh the service was nice. My friend love to sit at the sushi bar I love in the main dining. It's look like you have dinner at you house. Cocktails are delicious. They hve 2nd floor and cocktails lounge downstairs. Make sure you made a reservation. Really nice omakase, go for $140 and you will never disappointed.",0
"Overall, everything was very good, but I don't think I would come back. We started with the mozzarella sticks, which were very good but only 4 came in the order. For $13 I would think they would give more than 4 mozzarella sticks in an order. We also got the tie dye pizza. The crust was amazing. It was crispy and thin. However, the sauce was so sweet. I read a bunch of reviews and you either love or hate having sweet sauce on pizza. I really didn't like the sweet taste of it and wish they even used the marinara sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks. It's a good place to go once but I wouldn't go back.",0
"Radiance is a decent option for dim sum if you're looking for a nicer restaurant in the area. The food is on the pricier side, but the tea selection is definitely an asset. The restaurant is well-decorated in a traditional Chinese fashion and the service was attentive without being overbearing.",1
"This was my first AYCE sushi in around 1.5(?) years, so I was super excited to finally be going to a place where I can eat an endless amount of fish. There's a decent variety of sushi, sashimi, hot dishes, and other items such as crab legs. The rolls itself were quite large and filling; they slowed us down pretty quickly. Kikoo also offered an assortment of desserts at the end.

I would definitely recommend coming on an empty stomach if you want to come close to your money's worth. Solid AYCE experience after not having it for so long!",1
"Overall, I enjoyed my chicken bun from Ritual. The bun was a nice, fluffy texture and the chicken was very juicy and tender. However, the sauce was a bit bland and the overall flavor was not as strong as I would have liked. Overall, it's a decent sandwich and I would recommend it if you're looking for something quick and easy to eat.",1
"John's of Times Square is a great place for pizza, but the prices and service could use some improvement. The pizza is delicious, and the cathedral ceilings are a nice touch. The only downside is that the restaurant is quite empty, and we were seated right next to someone. The service was not very attentive, and the salad was overpriced. Overall, John's is a great pizza place, but the prices and service could use some improvement.",1
"We stopped by this restaurant while walking around little Italy, and while the margherita pizza was delicious, we were disappointed with the pasta. It was very bland and not very flavorful. The service was great, though, and the manager came to check on us. Overall, the food and atmosphere felt very touristy and not very authentic.",1
"FiDi doesn't have enough good Chinese food, and Chubby Princess helps solve this problem! Delicious food served in a cute, clean setting with VERY quick and friendly service. We enjoyed all the dishes, especially the scallion pancakes which are thin and crispy without being too oily. Pickled greens/pork/rice dish was spicier than expected, but everything else was perfect. The pork potstickers came out piping hot and flavorful. Appreciated that there are several vegetarian options! Prices are extremely reasonable, all the seating is small tables for 2, and the food came out in minutes, so this restaurant is ideal for a quick bite!",1
"Looking for a quick bite, we walked by Zorba Grill and decided to give it a try. The staff greeted us with warm smiles and were extremely welcoming, mind you it's New York City, so the vibe was different than what we've encountered so far. We ordered their lunch special; chicken doner wrap along with cheese wispers and ginger ale drink.I love how you make your own wrap and choose your toppings. The process is simple, you choose between a wrap or bowl, then your meat and 3 toppings. The hummus and yogurt dressing were my favorite. At the end, they heat your wrap and it comes out warm and delicious.The place was clean and well organized. The fridge had so many delicious options!!:D If you're around the neighborhood, make sure to give them a try. Portions are relatively filling and reasonably priced. Thank you New York for this delicious food and amazing staff.",0
"Breakfast on a Thursday morning was rather limited options.  I needed to enjoy life amid it was a cold rainy day.  A place to chill where there is good quality food for indoor setting, a seat and someone to service me are all that I request.  Customer service is impeccable to greet me upon entering, ushering me to a open available table, order taking, guest check-in during dinning, removal of plate, and bill payment.  I saw faces and warm smiles during my entire dinning experience.  I was well attended and served.  I like the decor and overall atmosphere as it is very bright despite being a dark rainy day.  It reminisce me of Paris, France.  Decor is very bright with a French flair of black and white postcards depicting three naked women displaying their bare buttocks wearing only high heels.Mimosa $14Slightly too much orange pulp.Two Eggs Any Style $15Choice of toast, herbed potatoes or mixed greensChoice of ham, bacon, or sausageI decided on medium cooked scrambled eggs, white toast and sausage.  I was provided orange marmalade, strawberry preserves, and butter for the toast.  I have a predilection for butter and orange marmalade which reminds me of British Paddington Bear.  The small jars of orange marmalade and strawberry preserves appear produced from local farms and the jars were difficult to open.  With the passage of time by mid-afternoon hunger pangs strike as this entree did not eat my fill.Nota bene:  facilities are labels ""WC"" for British English ""water closet.""  Facilities are relatively clean and resembles an English countryside.  Access to Cafe Luxembourg is the 1 local train at 72nd Street station located in Upper West Side between Amsterdam Avenue and End Avenue of West 70th Street.",0
"I had a great brunch at Minetta Tavern. The inside was very old school, and the food was great. I got a Bloody Mary, which I usually don't order out but it was the perfect mixture and not too spicy. We got the burger of course, a Belgian waffle, croque Monsieur  and French dip. All around nice meal, good cocktails and great service. Would definitely come back.",1
"I'm over the moon at the fact this place exists! Ever since I moved to the east coast I've had trouble finding quality fried pickles! But Diller is now my new go-to for whenever I have a craving. And they have gluten free and vegan options. This is only about a 5 min walk from the Grand St. train station, and the pickle guys are right next door. They have some seating outside too. I tried the regular fried pickles with the Diller sauce and Siracha Aioli sauce. The Diller sauce was good, it was creamy and reminded me of yogurt or laban cucumber sauce (IYKYK). The Siracha aioli sauce was tangy and had a little spice to it; this one is similar (imo) to the typical sauce you usually get with fried pickles. I preferred the Siracha Aioli, but I like that they have many different sauce options, because I love sauce!I think it's really important for me to add that the cashier was soooo friendly, he went over the menu and he gave me some background on the business. He explained to me that they had just hired a new pickle dipper (my words) so the batter was a little thicker than usual. But I honestly didn't mind at all, they were delicious! As soon as I finished my pickles, I wanted more, oops.",0
"John's was the first pizza place that my hubby and I ate at waaaay back in the day in 2003.  So we had to go back and try it again after all these years to try and have the same experience.  The pizza was and is awesome.  It's hot, delicious, the cheese has such a nice pull to it and the crust is superb.  That's about where the positives end though.  We went during the afternoon to a very quiet restaurant with lots of open tables and were seating by the bar in the corner right next to someone.  I know they're trying to spread the patrons out to their servers, but why not do that in the main room where John's cathedral ceilings made them famous?    And why seat us on top of someone in an empty restaurant.  The server was not attentive whatsoever, didn't stop by once to ask how we were doing and had to be flagged down for a refill which we didn't get.  The salad was overpriced for romaine, onions, tomatoes and mushrooms.  Don't get me wrong; it tasted good but the quality of ingredients were cheap.  The prices reflect the location, so I expected to pay $50 for a small pepperoni pizza, house salad and a soda.  I just wish the seating, service and salad matched the delight we got out of eating the pizza.",0
"I had a taste for some Chinese food and when I saw that there was an old school Cuban Chinese restaurant in the area I had to go for it. It was fairly empty when I arrived on a rainy Saturday. I was pretty surprised to see that they were still offering lunch specials on the weekends which I thought was pretty nice. I checked the menu prices, ranging from $15 - $25 for regular dishes.   Though the choices were limited they were still pretty good options. Since I was in the mood for fried rice, the waiter insisted on having it with wings, and I'm glad he did. We had a little issue with the first plate of rice (there was pork in it). I was quickly made a replacement. Still, it was absolutely delicious. I'll surely snag some again when I'm in the area, next time I'll add done veggies. There were none.",0
"Happy Hour review - great spot to grab a drink and quick bite.Happy Hour is from 5:00-6:30 and only bar seating, which is about 15 seats. Luckily my friends and I were able to grab some spots; the restaurant isn't busy around this time but the bar is poppin'. I tried the bakki cocktail, which was great. Really well made and high quality. We also got some of the small bites, which are warning: pretty small. The sliders were my fav, the arancini and vongole were also good. It's great if you're just looking for a small bite, but not filling enough for a meal. The bartenders were very attentive making sure we got water and could order more food if we wanted to. The inside of the restaurant has some very aesthetic art deco vibes. The decor is nice, the lighting is dim, and it'd be a great date spot. Overall would recommend checking it out.",0
I had a great experience at Chloe! The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. I especially loved their Quinoa Taco Salad. It was very filling and had great flavors. The service was also very fast which was great. I would definitely recommend Chloe to others.,1
"I recently visited this location and found it to be less than stellar. The chicken piccata was salty and less tender than usual, and the meatballs were not very good. The red sauce was also not very flavorful. The pizza was also not as good as my other favorite spot. Overall, I do not think this location is as good as when I order from 2nd Ave uptown.",1
"Luckily we came before the dinner rush and were seated right away. The truffle fries were cut thin, extra crispy and had truffle pieces on them! The pork buns and karaage chicken were amazing and flavorful as well. I got the Karaka Spicy Kasane ramen. It was delicious and is very tolerable if you like spice. The miso paste ball was a little too thick and made my broth too creamy/thick. I like it a little more soupy. I tried my boyfriend's Akamaru broth and loved it. Their egg was a little too overcooked for my liking though, but still, a solid ramen shop for their flavor and presentation.",0
"This restaurant was a great find! The staff were very accommodating and nice. The food was not too pricey and they made a great old fashioned. The shrimp scampi bread was a little too over-rated for my taste, but the fries were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The surprise birthday cookie was a nice touch!",1
"Came here for the first time with a group of friends. personally I don't think the service was up to par. The place was extremely cute and you can even request to sit outside (perfect for the summer) but back to the service..... Usually I would be a little uncomfortable if the waiter comes back every five mins or so to ask if the food is okay. However, in this situation, our waiter was basically nowhere to be found. Literally, sat us down, took our orders and she was gone throughout the whole meal.I order the strip steak and my dish was pretty delicious. I requested for medium rare and it indeed came out medium rare One of my friend ordered the lobster roll, however the fries that came with it, was cold. (The food did come out all at once, so maybe that was the reason)Overall the food was decent, I'm not sure if I would come back again though.",0
"The Viet tacos were disappointing - the pork filling was good but the taco shells was soggy. The bahn mi was probably the best part of the meal - the bread was good without cutting your mouth and it had the same yummy pork filling that the tacos had. The mango salad was decent but nothing too crazy. The pho was pretty standard but nothing too crazy. Overall, I feel like I could've gotten this same meal on Baxter Street for cheaper and faster. The service was slow but I know that everyone is understaffed nowadays. The outdoor space was nicely done, and the restaurant itself looks nice, but I'm pretty sure this was a one-and-done for me.",1
"I absolutely loved my experience at Tokyo Shio Ramen! The broth was light and flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I also really appreciated the abundance of greens in my bowl - it was a great way to get more greens into my diet. The only downside was that the portions were a bit small for my taste, but overall it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and healthy ramen broth.",1
"I went to this restaurant tonight for dinner and it was a great experience! The food was ready when promised and the pickup time was great - I wasn't waiting long at all. The Cobb salad I ordered was really good - the chicken, bacon, avocado, and bleu cheese were all cooked well and the vinaigrette was really delicious. The portion size was also generous, and I wasn't starving after eating it. I also ordered a salad as a lighter option and it was just as delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others - the value is great and the food is really good.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good but the portions were a bit small. The steak was good, but the serving size was definitely on the skimpy side. The fries were also good. The almond cake was also good, but I thought it could have been a bit sweeter. The cocktails were well made. The service was good, but I didn't need to flag them down at all.",1
"Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday and we were both unfortunately disappointed. I live around the corner so I was meaning to try this place. Was turned off immediately because the waitress was obviously trying to pad the Bill. Hate when they do this! Pushing everything from double portions of tartare to expensive drinks,  main courses and additional side dishes. We opted for the single portion of tartare. Both thought it was flavorless. We were going to get a bottle of wine but my girlfriend knows her wine and said everything is overpriced. She ordered one of their specialty tequila drinks instead, although also overpriced. Looked fancy but 100% had no booze in it! For dinner, she ordered the skate. Do not order this dish!! We both thought the fish was stringy and weird tasting. She is too nice to complain and didn't send it back. Hers came with a side of spinach that was drenched in butter, which neither of us also cared for. I had the Bronzino, which was actually tasty. Problem was it had quite a few small bones and it came with nothing on the side. Hers fish came with spinach and mine nothing?? Of course the waitress stressed the point that we needed to order an overpriced side. So we ordered the broccolini, which was a small, flavorless portion of a few stalks and a whole bunch of hard stems. Had to cover it in salt, pepper and pepper flakes and it was still lousy. 15$ extra for a  side dish with zero flavor that should be included! Overall, overpriced and unimpressive! Do yourself a favor and walk literally 50 feet to Osteria Cotta (btw 84/85th). Great Italian restaurant with fabulous apps, drinks, service and Bronzino that will be half as expensive and thoroughly more enjoyable!",0
"The vibe of this place was perfect for a large group in the summer as they had a big outdoor seating area. The food was also fantastic. I ate the Margherita Pizza which was very delicious and huge for the price. All the pasta were also very good as well but smaller in portion size. You will definitely have leftovers if you get a pizza! However, customer service was a little lacking. We never received the complimentary bread that we noticed all the other tables had. Moreover, we were not offered water for a long time and had to tell the waiter that he never returned our credit card. The food came out very quickly and we were ready with our orders before we got seated due to the menu outside the restaurant. To be fair, the restaurant was probably overwhelmed by the number of people since it is new. I would come back in a few months when they are more experienced because the food was excellent!",1
"Douska is probably my second favorite handroll sushi spot in the city for its price point. It doesn't quite beat the price and taste of Kazunori for me, but I find that Douska still a very solid option and conveniently located in the Lower East Side. They have a handful of pre-fixe temaki sets to choose from which save you a few bucks compared to ordering a la carte. If you're really hungry, I think the 6-roll set ($35 for yellowtail, crabmeat, snapper, negi toro, Hokkaido scallop, and shrimp tempura) is filling with enough room for dessert. My favorite rolls here are the salmon and Hokkaido scallop.They have enclosed outdoor seating and indoor seating. I usually come here on weekends for lunch and it hasn't ever been very busy. I don't usually experience issues with getting a table, which can be nice if you just want to show up, get seated, and order immediately. This is a good place to come to when I want to switch things up between my favorite sushi spots.",0
"Overall, I thought the restaurant was beautiful and had a really cool vibe. However, the food was not very good in my opinion. The portions were really small and the flavors didn't really stand out to me. The location is definitely great, but I don't think I would recommend this restaurant based on the food.",1
"I had the best pizza ever at this restaurant! The pepperoni toppings were so generous, and it was really crunchy and doughy at the same time. I really enjoyed the spicy vodka on my pizza, it added a delicious kick. The line usually takes about 30-40 mins, but I thought it was worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",1
"I really enjoyed their assortment of cakes and buns - they're always freshly made each day. This location is a bit narrow, so it can be a bit congested in there, but the milk bun was really delicious. The log cake slice were good, but the creme filling seemed to be fresh, but the sponge cake itself was a bit hard on the outside. I've been a loyal customer of this bakery for quite some time now, and I'll definitely continue to do so.",1
"The food was good, but the service was not. The waiter was attentive at first, but he soon disappeared and was difficult to find for additional drinks. He also never asked how we enjoyed our meal when he left the check.",1
"Pera is such a beautiful restaurant with great ambiance and service. I came for happy hour on a Friday. All of the drinks we ordered were very strong, I really liked the margarita! The happy hour appetizers were great! Recommendations: margarita or the spritzer for drinkseggplant dip and the kofte meatball were my favorite appetizers. For entree, we got the cavatelli which was cooked to perfection.Great service here too! It was a little cold at our table with the draft, I'd recommend to grab a seat by the bar side of the restaurant, but other than that I had a great happy hour at Pera!",0
"I ordered dosa from here based on a friend's recommendation, and while they were both alright, I don't think I would order them again. The dosa at a dine-in experience may be better.",1
"Overall, I had a good time at this restaurant. The service was a bit slow, but the food was good. I especially enjoyed the Mermaid Fish Tacos - they had a perfect amount of crunch to the fish and it was surprisingly a good portion. Overall, I would recommend this place to others.",1
"We are very disappointed Location: I can't even consider being in a place this tiny for dinner. And as the day goes dark, customers continue to come in. It's nothing but waiting time for customers who consider dining here. For me, basically sitting next to stranger for food this close is unbearable. Food: they serve more food on the weekend than during weekday. That's being said. All I can order is noodles and lu rou fan and soft tofu. Price is way too high. For a noodle that size which costs me 14 dollars?! Nope. And the noodle is nothing special. To be honest, I have experienced and dined in much better noodle place in Manhattan. Don't know where the hype coming from. 3 stars is all I can get. Just disappointed",0
"I had a really great time at this restaurant! The Ramen Burger was really good, and the Miso Lobster Ramen was even better. The sauce was amazing. The only downside was that I didn't think anything else was extraordinary, but the pork jowl bun was a bit of a disappointment. But overall a great experience!",1
"Often order from NAYA for lunch to my office. Fresh, authentic, delish middle eastern food. My go to is usually their bowl w lamb, onions, jalapeños, tomatoes always w a side of whipped garlic and green sauce are seriously crack. Their grape leaves yummy as well. Their falafels are my 2nd go to! Always quick delivery and my food arrives warm and I always have a little left over to snack on.",0
"I wasn't impressed with the pizza at Joe's in New York City - it was a bit sweet and not very flavorful. I prefer the original Napoli pizza, which is what this restaurant is known for. The dough was thin and crispy, but other than that the pizza wasn't anything special. I don't think Joe's is the place to go for pizza in New York City - it's just not up to my standards.",1
"Prince Street Pizza is some of the best pizza I've ever had. The pepperoni square slice is amazing and definitely lives up to all the hype! The margherita slice is also great, not very greasy and a nice counter to the greasy af (but still yummy) pepperoni slice.",1
"I wanted to love this place based on all my friend's hype. Came here for brunch today with a few friends and we ordered a couple of items for the table and had our own entrees. We got the ricotta cheese and the rosemary foccachia bread. The foccachia was amazing, i did enjoy that a lot. The ricotta cheese was just ricotta cheese served with some bread and honey. Felt like straight out of a container? Idk I was expecting more. I ordered a drink called Aviola which was pretty good. For my entree I got the rigatoni arrabiatta, and it was pretty good but nothing special. It's not spicy at all, I wouldn't call it arrabiatta plus there wasn't enough sauce. Giving this place a 3 Stars because it was average, nothing special however it has cute aesthetics and decor.",0
I absolutely love Thai food and I'm so glad I found this place! The food is really good and their delivery is really convenient. I usually don't have to wait too long for a table and their thai iced tea is also really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Thai food.,1
"Overall, I didn't enjoy my experience at this restaurant. The atmosphere was dark and loud, and the food wasn't particularly great. The soup dumplings were particularly disappointing - they lacked flavor and seemed to come from a package from a Chinese supermarket. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"Top thai is my favorite Halal Thai spot in NYC. 10/10 food & service. Great outdoor dining, and food served in minutes!",0
I was really disappointed with my experience at this Chinese restaurant. The food was bland and the portions were small. I would not recommend it.,1
"Dim Sum Palace is a great place to go for a late night meal. The service is friendly and attentive, and the food is okay. I don't think I would recommend the ""juicy dumplings"" though. The table cloths are a bit dirty, but that's the only negative thing I can say about the restaurant.",1
"Tipsy had a great $5.00 lunch special, which was a huge surprise. The chicken sandwich and burger were both really good, and the wings were really good as well! The bathrooms are also European style with floor to ceiling doors, which I really appreciate. I would definitely go back!",1
"I ordered a braised buffalo carp fish tail, as I wanted to try something interesting that was difficult to find at other Shanghainese restaurants. It came with a moderate portion, butterflied neatly into bone-in chunks. It was a bony fish so it wasn't the easiest to eat, but the flavor was pretty good, and the skin was quite edible and tasty; maybe it was just a little on the oily side, as the fish itself was already pretty fatty. The red-braise sauce penetrated the meat well.3.5 stars",0
"3.5 but Yelp doesn't give you that choiceI came here yesterday at 2 for a group of 9 for my friends birthday brunch. There were really accommodating of the group (we reserved ahead of time)AmbianceWe sat in the garden in the back which was so quaint. The area was decorated in flowers, vines and plants (some real, some artificial) which created a cozy and inviting environment. It's a very casual place (if that matters)Service Our waiter was very nice and accommodating considering were a larger group and arrived at different timesFoodThere were mixed reviews about the food. We ordered plenty of appetizers to share such as the shrimp donuts, spring rolls, egg roti, and fried wings. My favorite were the shrimp donuts and egg roti. The chicken came out kind of pink but we were advised that's how they're cooked. I had thai ice tea but it was different from the traditional tea I've had. Everyone ordered different mains. I ordered the crab fried rice, it was mediocre. My boyfriend ordered the kao soy with short rib. He really enjoyed it. Overall it was pretty average.",0
"Northern Tiger is a decent restaurant if you're looking for something quick and convenient. The beef stew noodles were pretty good, but the noodles were a bit too soggy for my taste. The beef was also pretty spare, but the hot oil that came with it added a nice touch to the soup. I'm definitely going to try the scallion pancakes next time I visit.",1
"Lukes is a great place for a lobster roll, but the waitstaff can be a bit grumpy. We made a reservation for 6:15, but didn't get seated until after 6:30 due to a large party. Despite repeated thank-yous, all the waitstaff would say was ""no problem."" This was pretty noticeable, and we ended up laughing about it later. But if you're looking for a good lobster roll, Lukes is definitely worth a visit.",1
"Located in Midtown, TONCHIN is a Michelin recognized ramen restaurant with its roots straight from Tokyo. Reservation was easy to make and change via Resy, with multiple confirmation reminders the day beforehand.My friend and I came in for an early dinner and we were seated quickly. We shared a Pick 3 sampler platter (edamame, shishito pepper, shoestring potato) and then each ordered their signature Tokyo tonkotsu ramen.The edamame was my favorite of the samplers, prepared generously with sesame oil and salt to give it peak umami flavor. The other two appetizers were overly seasoned and as a result hard to finish.The ramen similarly was overly salty; the broth, although not heavy, had such a high sodium load that I went through multiple glasses of water with my meal. On the bright side, the homemade noodles were fresh and chewy, and I was a fan of the thin cha-shu pork slices.All in all, a good venture for ramen in NYC, just slightly disappointing given its rave reviews.",0
"TLDR: 3.5/5

This was a nice little whole in the wall. Quite literally because I did not see it when we walked by it in. We got there around 6:45 and by the time we left there was a line out the door and at least a 45 minute wait (from what I heard). The place is quite small and people were taking their time so I'd account either being a little before the dinner rush or embracing the wait. Side note it was kind of dark in there. And not in a it had nice dark ambiance but it was just dark dark.

Service: 4/5

Service was mid. They were nice but didn't really check in which would've been fine but I was yearning for more water. Food: 4/5

For value?? Pretty good ramen for $13. Probably by far the cheapest ramen I've had. I got the vegan miso ramen but a lot of the prices faired between 12-16 which again is very good. Presentation was mid and the flavors were just okay. I'd probably go back if I wasn't sure where else to go in the area.",1
"I came here with as a group of three on a Friday night to celebrate the end of the school year. We made a reservation in case it was crowded and had to wait. There were people but it wasn't packed nor were people waiting outside. Nerai is a very nice modern restaurant with a sleek interior. There were outside seating which could be very nice since the restaurant is in a more secluded part of town. I ordered the salmon which was cooked very nicely. Not at all dry! I loved the crispy onions on top. The risotto on the bottom was creamy. It's definitely a fancier restaurant that I would go to for celebrations.  Our waiters were very attentive which was nice. Overall, pretty good restaurant experience.",0
"The most reliable Italian restaurant I have found in the city. Looking for an intimate, affordable wine bar with memorable food? You've found it here. I am a longtime fan of the restaurant group that owns Cotenna, Aria, Briciola, etc. They all have different names so it's hard to notice that they are owned by the same group and serve similar items, but it is great to know that wherever you are in the city, one is close by!Cotenna has a simple and straightforward menu with all appetizers, pastas, and sides with the same prices. Waiters are very knowledgeable about wine recommendations. On my most recent visit, we shared 3 pasta dishes. The macaroni and cheese with truffle was not too overwhelmingly truffley, but our favorite dish was the pesto pasta with artichokes. A great pesto is hard to find!Bravo!",0
"The restaurant itself is cute and the service was good when we made our reservation. However, the cold air coming in through the door was really unpleasant and I had to put my coat and scarf back on while we were dining. My pasta dish was really good, but my husband's steak was mediocre. The service wasn't very good at all - my husband had to wait a long time for a steak knife and he wasn't offered any ketchup for his fries. Overall, I think we would only go back if it was really cold outside.",1
"I love Banter for their delicious and fresh food. I always have a satisfying meal when I'm there. The falafel bowl is my favorite, it's perfect portion size and great presentation. Their coffee drinks are also delicious. I highly recommend Banter for breakfast or lunch!",1
"dollar pizza + Spanish food joint located on the lower east siderough oldish budget takeout interior with some seating. several tables are on the left and the Spanish food hot foods are on the right. the pizza pies & slices are in the back. the plain slice was not the worst slice that I have ever had. the pizza here is just solidly bad. the pizza sauce tastes like Chef Boyardee ravioli sauce--sweet and watery. the crust is sorta thin but is somehow mushy. the cheese was okay. the pizza is kept under heat lamps. my slice was warm, but it was just elementary school cafeteria food which doesn't cut it as an adult. honestly if the pizza dude threw all slices in the oven...i think the pizza would taste somewhat better. the tables were mostly taken up by people not eating. it was a mix of locals & weirdos staring at you while you order. unlikely to return here, proceed at your own risk. drops mic cuz there's nothing left to sayi outzzz",0
"This new lunch spot offers a great variety of options for those looking for a quick bite. The space is small, but comfortable and there is seating available. The menu is brightly colored and a bit all over the place, but I was able to find what I was looking for after a few minutes of searching. I ordered the Slammin' Saag with Beef ($12) and an Iced Chai ($4.50). The food was made to order while the chai was pre-bottled, and I was surprised to find that the chai was already cold when it arrived. The saag frankie is hefty, with loads of spinach, beef, and paneer barely keeping inside the wrap. The intense flavor and not too spicy was a great surprise, and I was very pleased with the overall dish. The only qualm I had was that I didn't taste much, if any, of the mango pickle marination on the beef. The chai was solid despite being pre-bottled, not too sweet and an even amount of cardamom. Overall, I was very happy with my experience at this new lunch spot, and I would recommend it to others.",1
Came here a few weeks ago on a nice warm Friday evening for drinks with a friend. It is an outdoor bar in middle of the park area. Specialized in drinks with Fever Tree products. Very nice.,0
"The carbonara at Olio e Piu is quite good. The savory sauce with great presentation is a great way to start their meal. However, I do not recommend the clam linguini. It tastes like just boiled noodles and boiled clam mixed together. The noscara was also quite disappointing. Plain cheese with very thin slices of prosciutto do not go well with each other. It was like soft tofu on a pizza.",1
"Wagamama is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in New York City, but their food recently has not been up to par. My vegetable tempura was cold by the time it got to the table, and according to the restaurant schpiel, tempura should be crispy but it was doughy and soggy. The pad Thai was not cold when I got it but lost the small amount of heat it had very quickly. There was no spice and it was boring, flavor-wise. The soba was not made from buckwheat, which I found strange given that this is a Japanese restaurant. Overall, Wagamama is like the MacDonalds of Asian food - which is not a good thing.",1
"I had a really interesting time at Frevo, but I think the concept is stronger than the food. The food was good, but not great. I really enjoyed the calamari and duck, but the other dishes were just okay for me. The wine pairing was really great, and the sommelier was really knowledgable. I'm not sure that I would come back here on my own, but I would definitely recommend it to someone else.",1
"The winner of the night was the fried brussels sprouts. They were perfectly crispy and doused in a delicious oil. The only downside was that there wasn't much of a flavor other than salt and pepper, so if you're not a fan of salty foods, this might not be the dish for you. The mac and cheese was not as good as I had hoped. The cheese was artificial and had a strange orange flavor. It was also quite sticky and would probably get stuck to the wall if you tried to eat it. However, it was still edible.",1
"The food at Sichuan Hot Pot Cuisine was good, but the order was incorrect on our part. The smashed cucumber was instead given as the appetizer, the spicy fish stew was given as the non-spicy fish stew, and the wonton soup only had noodles, not wonton wrappers. Despite this, the food was still tasty. The spicy fish stew was a particular favorite of ours, and was accompanied by white rice. The fish was so tender and soft, and the wonton soup and smashed cucumbers were also very good. I'm not sure we would return specifically for the hotpot, but it does many other dishes reliably well.",1
"Really fun rooftop with a good view! Pretty much surrounded by Midtown on a 4th floor rooftop. Music is so loud you have to shout sometimes. $25 for all you can drink mimosas/bellinis/etc for 90 mins. Their other drinks are pretty standard. Service is hit or miss--our bartender was lacking while we were waiting for our other party to arrive, but our server was really patient and nice! Food was more like a 3-star rating, but not too bad. Fun atmosphere with cute decor and the type of crowd that will start a Conga line in the middle of brunch. Despite the mediocre food and prices, I'd maybe come back again for a fun time with great company.One thing that really irked me was the standard gratuity they added. I was charged automatic tip for my $14 drink while we waited when the bartender wasn't really around. $2.50 automatic tip for one drink, esp when we're just grabbing on the way to our table? Ehh. And then again at the end of our meal for a group of three. (That, I guess I can kind of understand.) So overall, just be advised to double check your receipts! I've read some reviews of being charged for wrong items as well. Happy brunching!",0
"I had a great time at Chloe today! The salads are really good, reasonably priced ($10.50) and delicious. My favourite is their Kale Caesar Salad with mushroom ""bacon"". But my only complaint is that their mushroom ""bacon"" is extremely salty. But even with that, the salad is still really good. And their sweet potato fries (even though they say are air baked, could be less oily. However, these sweet potato fries are delicious- even though they taste deep fried. Another great dish is their Spicy Thai Salad. I would definitely come back.",1
"For the most part I enjoyed the meal, I ordered the King Crab Legs with the fiery house sauce... I am obsessed with spicy foods and anytime I do seafood boils I always go for the spiciest blend - I've had better but this blend was okay. My date had the Snow Crab Legs with no sauce and had no complaints there either... I had to take two stars off for the service though, it was subpar at best. The worst part was the tone and demeanor in which we were told that they don't accept cards , as it's a Cash Only establishment - I rechecked the menus, that wasn't listed ANYWHERE, I tried to read all the boards and signs around the restaurants, still nothing. It's one thing to be a cash only establishment in 2019... its another thing to not post it anywhere and surprise patrons at the end of their meal... it costs you two stars when the waitress gnarls at you and gives you the evil eye the whole time you're waiting for your date to return from an impromptu trip to the nearest bank.",0
"I stopped by the bakery today and was really impressed! The muffins were delicious, and the coffee had a great flavor. It was a really transparent environment, so I could see the product being made. It's a great business model - I would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
"PURCHASED: All-you-can-eat chili & all-you-can-drink Shiner (Note: special Texas Ex's event) TOTAL: $50 PROS:+ incredible venue: Great venue to host things for a large organization. There is a huge colosseum-like structure where patrons are in. At the center, a large fountain or a place that stage can be built over for a live band/entertainment (see photo). The colosseum is open in the center. The cafe is located in one section of the colosseum. The edge surrounding the lip of this bunkered colosseum is the round-a-bout where cars above are driving around. You can see the top of the cars as they navigate around the colosseum as you stand below. + great location: The cafe sits right next to the docks where various yachts of all sizes are. Bordering on the sides of the cafe overlooking the dock is the beautiful park that runs north and south along the western coast of Manhattan. Exiting the cafe into the park is incredible. Lay a big blanket out and start enjoying a wonderfully shaded area. CONS: - Be responsible, do not drink more than you can handle. You do not want to waste any bad experiences due to drinking in such a nice place. IMPRESSION:- This spot is truly excellent for a Saturday all-day outing. My true score of this location is a 4.5/5 (please read aforementioned assessment).",0
"The atmosphere at this restaurant is really fun and inviting. The service is great, and the food is tasty and expensive, but worth it. The omelette I had was really amazing, and I would definitely recommend it!",1
"I'm really disappointed in my 2nd visit to this restaurant.  The chicken was dry and the sauce was too sweet.  Plus, now it's more expensive than it used to be. As far as the service goes, it's always been fast and friendly. But in my opinion, the food doesn't justify the price.",1
"Novel take on Ramen and delicious Japanese BBQ.nonono is a ramen and yakitori joint that specializes in chicken. Unlike most ramen establishments, nonono makes their broth out of chicken instead of beef or pork, giving their soups a lighter flavor that doesn't leave your stomach feeling weighed down with the abundance of fat. If you're looking for a filling lunch that won't slog you down when you return to work, or a carb heavy dinner before a night of partying, nonono's chicken ramen is perfect.If you're looking for smaller snacks, or want sides to accompany your ramen, nonono offers a wide variety of yakitori. Yakitori is Japanese BBQ served on small skewers. Much like their ramen, nonono focusses on chicken skewers offering every part of the chicken on a stick. But you can also fight more savory yakitori if you want something greasier. My absolute favorite are the meatball yakitori. These oval lumps of meat are well seasoned and juicy beyond reproach. One thing that really ups the dining experience at nonono is their service. Their staff is extremely responsive when using the call buttons. Our waiter was both outgoing and friendly as well as knowledgeable of the menu.Whether you're looking for a quick bite or a sit down meal, say yesyesyes to nonono!",0
"I've been other location few times since last year and my friend told me about this location which was closed from where I was stayed most of time in NYC. I wanted eat Thai food and was too tired for go out for eat dinner. I ordered pad Thai with seafood, papaya salad, chicken with chili & basil sauce. I know this place spicy level was too spicy and I just ordered non of spicy. I wanted order spicy but I have a sensitive stomach and got problem again. I recommended this place to my friends and they really enjoyed eat also they love this place too. Pad Thai was seems too white but it really flavorful. Papaya salad was fresh, a bit disappointed cuz salad was too little. I didn't know that came only little than when I go to eat at other location. I personally thought its little because of delivery, maybe it would different when you go to there for eat. I didn't enjoyed eat chicken with chili and basil sauce from some of chicken smell. This place isn't delivery and you should use Uber eat or Postmates for delivery. I personally thought postmates was a bit expensive than seamless or Uber eat.",0
"I had a great time at Shinn East two weeks ago! The omakase was really good and the prices are definitely worth it. I was really full after the meal, which is a testament to how good the food is. I definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a great meal at a great price. The only downside is that it was pretty hot that day and we sat outside, which made it a bit difficult to stay hydrated. Overall, I had a great time and I'll definitely be back!",1
"I had a great time at One19 Wine Bar last night! The wine selection was fantastic, and my server, Gianni, was very knowledgeable and helpful. The panzanella salad and ricotta bruschetta were both delicious, and the wine on tap was a nice touch. I highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a nice date night or to catch up with friends.",1
"I stopped by this little lunch spot for a quick bite and I was really impressed. The food was great - especially the chicken tinga tacos - and the atmosphere was really nice. It's an authentically Mexican restaurant, so you can be sure you're getting the real deal. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area.",1
"It's a diner...too many in the city to count but I like that this one is close to my job. Came in to grab a quick lunch with a neighborhood friend. I must say, the portions were generous but the service lacked. We were seated right away but it took a while to order, which sadly cut  into our one hour lunch time limit.  However, when the food arrived, we were ready to nosh. I ordered the chopped steak with cheese and salad, which by the way, the salad was huge!  I shared it with my lunch bud as it was way bigger than it needed to be. The chopped steak was chewy but I'll give them points for flavor.  The meat was cooked a little too well done for my taste as it was a bit tough - even though I ordered it medium rare.My friend ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese. Hers was simply put together and looked satisfying.  The thing with diners, they always have huge bagels!  The lox was decent I was told.Again, couldn't care much for the service or lack of.  It took a while to order, even longer to get the check.  The time it took to get our drinks was the only thing that was quick.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was fantastic, and the service was great as well. The portions were huge, and I left so full but it was great. I would definitely come back!",1
"I had a great experience at Burger King! The burgers were fresh and juicy and tasted great. The chicken sandwiches were also great. They offer a variety of sides and combo meal specials, which is great. Unfortunately, they close early, so a late night snack is not an option. Overall, I would definitely recommend Burger King to anyone.",1
"The Happiest Hour definitely helped me have a happy Tuesday!As other reviewers have mentioned, the burger is a bit small and more of a fast food size - however, I found it surprisingly filling. Really, my only negative is I found it a bit too salty. The fries were also delicious and seasoned to perfection. I could just eat a large bowls of fried tbh.Both of the cocktails I tried were also great - the mango one was interesting and spicy, and the peach one tasted like a delicious alcoholic sparkling soda. And I love that you can replace everything with vodka!Prices were a bit high, but food and drinks were great!",0
I love Klong! The Thai food here is so good. The noodles dishes and curries are my favorites. My friends and I got the pad see euw and kee mao today. The lunch special is a great deal as it comes with soup or salad and an appetizer too. The waiters are so friendly and attentive too!,0
"I ordered the roast duck over rice and the shrimp dumplings since they didn't have half their appetizers available. When I asked about the rice rolls the waitress just quietly shook her head and I was confused what she meant by that. But anyway I was served tea first (wondering if I was even charged for it based off someone else's review) and shortly the duck came out first and it was not hot. It had lots of bones making it difficult to get a bite of the meat but it was pretty fatty and good. The waitress didn't really speak as she brought out our food either so the overall vibe here was a bit sad. The shrimp dumplings came out late and we just went to the front to pay. I thought I would just be able to pay and go, but the waitress quickly asked me to tip her because she served me. I didn't mind tipping but I'm realizing it was awkward because I paid in cash and couldn't calculate anything so if you're not from here make sure to tip them for subpar service!",0
"With chef cred and a highly inventive menu, Milu rides in with fast casual Chinese fare that takes familiar flavors to a whole new level.They were closed yesterday lunch due to high demand the evening before. Lunch starts at 11:Ate:Mandarin duckPoached Salomon Total $32I have to say the duck fat rice that comes with the duck was a luxurious treat as I rarely eat white rice and this one was sinful. I enjoyed the flavor of the poached salmon immensely and it was a great deal at $15 jammers. Covid be damned!",0
"It's been years since my initial visit, I happen to come here to celebrate my company holiday dinner, we are a small firm & had one of private rooms in the back. Dinner was set up buffet style , waiter took the drink orders to begin... I ended up having some Sauvignon blanc it was good. Also tried the Passion fruit mojito not bad good taste. Food to start we had some Hummus they had a few different one's the regular  & pink color hummus were good & so was the tahini sauce good with the pita bread. On the Food, the Meatballs were very good & the Zucchini chips were great, they had a really nice taste. Chicken skewers were ok kinda dry, decent lamb chops but it had an after taste, good shrimp. there was another meat ball which I believe were crab cakes? not too bad.Brussel sprouts were ah lacked flavor, the Greek salad was not bad. For dessert we had two cakes one was like a bread pudding this was not bad & the other had flaky layers that one was better nice taste with a hint of sweetness. Service wise could improved only because when we arrived the room was not properly set up, drinks took a bit of time to come. Restaurant itself is nicely decorated specially during the holidays, the fish smell is very strong in the restaurant, decent atmosphere outside by the bar area, over all we had a nice time.",0
"I came to Laut for lunch with colleagues and was able to be immediately sat outside in their outdoor/covered seating area. Their food is a nice mix of Malaysian and Singaporean food and very well made with solid portions. The service was decent, the food came fast and hot, and I/my group had no issues with our meal, food, drinks, etc. I would recommend this spot for lunch and didn't have any issues that my fellow yelpers mentioned, but I came on a Tuesday afternoon and might have gotten lucky.",0
"Overall, I had a really great time at this restaurant. The bar seating was very accommodating and the music was great. My only complaint is that the chicken was a bit bland, but overall it was a great sandwich. The pickles were a great addition, and the porch sipper was really refreshing. I would definitely come back!",1
"I've been to Jongro, Baekjong, and the likes, but Love BBQ tops them as my favorite KBbq spot at the moment. Immediately upon walking in, a couple aspects set them apart:1. There was no wait at all on a Saturday night at 8pm (they have 3 floors)2. There was very little smell of smoke (they have side vented grills that absorb the smell instead of top suction ventilation)We ordered a Cheese Dukbokki to start and a small Pork Combo Set for 2 people. The price range is between Jongro and Baekjong (within $10 of each). Within 5 minutes we were brought banchan (kimchi, mac salad, pickled seaweed, and this semi bitter vegetable), lettuce wraps, the picked onions for the wrap, and a truffled steam egg on the house. I typically don't like steamed eggs, but this one was executed well (the light layer of truffle oil on top definitely helped). The Dukbokki was great, and had a massive layer of gooey melted mozzarella on top, but unfortunately did not have the egg, fried dumplings, and fishcake advertised on the menu (oops?). The combo came with pork jowl, pork collar, and pork belly. I loved the jowl and belly cuts, but the collar was a bit lean and dry for my taste. The kimchi stew was on the sweet (rather than sour) side, but still good. The service here was incredibly attentive (almost too attentive). Water refills, banchan refills, meat cook, and other requests were fulfilled quickly and generously. Unlike other reviews, we didn't feel rushed - the waiter waited for us to finish a cut and asked us if we were ready before grilling the next. The only minor complaint is that the waiter had to lean in to cook the meat since the grill is in the center of the table, which makes it slightly intrusive when it's a group of 2 sitting on the outer edge of the table (and he's there flipping/cutting it every 2-3min). But that's more of a logistical issue with the layout than an actual problem with the restaurant.",0
"I was really happy with my mean green sandwich from this small, take-out only sandwich shop. The sandwich had a lot of flavor and spice, and the tofu was a great texture. The prices were a bit high for the appetizer, but it was definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"We came here for dessert after hearing rave reviews from our friends and we were not disappointed! The small little restaurant downstairs has both indoor and outdoor seats and we were able to get a table quickly. Service was quick and our temperatures were checked before we were seated. We ordered one item per person, but ended up eating our own desserts as we didn't have space. The golden toast was crunchy and sweet with honey and strawberries, ice cream and whipped cream. It was a delicious and filling dessert that we will definitely be back to try!",1
"I came here on a Friday evening with a group of 4 and even though it was pretty full, we were able to be seated right away. I had the Tom yum soup ($4.95), the lemongrass pork skewer (free with yelp check in), and the red curry with pork ($11.95). I also had a Thai iced tea.

I think overall I was very pleased. The highlight for me was the pork skewer. It was flavorful, rich, and filling! The Tom yum soup, Thai iced tea, and red curry tasted authentic and had the right flavor combinations. The Tom yum soup was light in terms of the clear soup but still slightly spicy, slightly sweet and slightly sour or had the right hint of lime. The Thai iced tea was creamy and sweet. The red curry was spicy, the curry was thick, and it also has a tiny hint of sweetness. It was a generous portion too. The only slight negative was it was quite loud in the restaurant but that can be expected on a Friday night! The service overall was very good- waitress was prompt and attentive.",1
"This is the new flower shop / restaurant, where they actually give you a flower menu along with the dinner menu.I did not buy a $50 bouquet to go with dinner, but I did spend a lot of money on the very good food.Definitely start with the excellent Sweet Potato Sourdough ($8) and for the mains, the  Duck Cappellacci ($31) was amazing. Get dessert too - the dense Chocolate Cake ($12) was especially memorable.According to their website, they'll have an all day food menu as well as breakfast and brunch so I'd definitely come back to try some of the more casual stuff.",0
"Came to S'MAC with a friend for lunch. It was super spacious with plenty of seating and with COVID, everything was contactless which was nice. There are so many varieties of Mac that it was hard to choose but I ordered the Mediterranean and my friend did a build your own. The food came out quickly and it was SO GOOD!! Super cheesy and all the toppings were delicious. My friend has severe allergies, so S'MAC was a great option for her as they have gluten-free options and allowed her to build her own mac! I also love the community fridge initiative they have. So delicious and allergen-friendly, would definitely go again.",0
"I was looking forward to trying out this vegan/vegetarian restaurant but unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. My friend and I ordered the Tomato Basil Soup, Mac N Cheese, Air Baked Fries, and The Classic Burger. All of the food was mediocre, with the exception of the Classic Burger which was good. The Mac N Cheese was terrible, and the Tomato Basil Soup was pretty bland. The restaurant is conveniently located by the train station, but I didn't appreciate that they charged extra for any substitutions. The young host taking our order was friendly and attentive, but I thought the restaurant was a bit too clean for my taste. Overall, I'd give this restaurant a 3 out of 10.",1
"The omurice is okay. The sauce is great, but I feel like the egg might be a little bit overcooked. The pork tonkatsu is delicious, and you also get a small soup bowl with this combo. The ramen is normal. They do have these special bowls where you can have 2 different ramen choices in a same bowl with a divider. The wait to get a table was a little long.",0
I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was great and the food was even better. The only downside was that the restaurant was very busy and it was hard to hear the people at our own table. The food was definitely worth the price and I would definitely recommend it.,1
"I came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 5 people on a Friday night.  There was a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.  We ordered the green tea gnocchi, the king crab dumplings, the rock shrimp tempura, and four sushi rolls (spicy crunchy salmon, spicy tuna, yellowtail jalapeno, eel avocado).  The gnocchi was a bit too chewy but the sauce was rich.  I would skip the king crab dumplings, not much crab flavor or crab for that matter.  The rock shrimp tempura was lightly battered and the sauce was tasty.  The sushi rolls were fresh and had a even amount of filling vs rice ratio.  Service was friendly and fast.  I would come back and try other dishes.",0
"Not going to lie, I came to Koreatown to get Korean food, but the restaurants around were so packed and the wait time was about 1 hour or so. Mind you, this was on a weekend, so that's to be expected. But, I wanted to try my luck somewhere else.  So I decided to come to Koku Ramen instead and I am so glad I did!The signature dish koku ramen was delicious. Perfect in the cold weather, so tasty, warm, and filling.  I also like that fact the koku ramen can be made very spicy. Ofcourse, I got mine very spicy. Fast service, great ramen, and friends.  What a great combination for a good time.  Thank you Koku ramen, now I will come back to Koreatown just for you.",0
I had a great time at Upland! The food was excellent and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
This restaurant was phenomenal! We came with a group of 10 people on a 8:30 PM reservation on a Saturday. We were late and they were very accommodating. Waiters were friendly. Food was perfect. We had a mix of food amongst us all but the standout of all things was the brussel sprouts. We also got the Schnitzel which was hearty with an awesome cucumber salad. The Burrata was also perfect and melted in your mouth. 10/10 would go back but more suited to a more intimate date spot.,1
"Delicious!! Malik who was our server was an absolute pleasure! He was professional, friendly and timely the entire time. My pastrami rueben was finger licking good. Malik recommended a tasty lavender drink that was to die for. Loved our quick getaway to NYC!!",0
"Brasserie 8 1/2 is a great spot to go for brunch on a Sunday! The buffet had a great selection of items, and I especially enjoyed the lamb, smoked salmon, and shrimp cocktail. The made-to-order crepes were also a great choice. Overall, the brunch was a great value and I will definitely be back!",1
"The restaurant itself is very small and cramped, with rusty fixtures and very unsteady tables. The food was okay, but nothing particularly standout. The brioche French toast was quite doughy and had a generous amount of Nutella on top- it was pretty sweet. The brussel sprouts were crispy and had some peanuts on top- they were a bit too salty for my taste. The eggs Scandinavian was also average, with softer bread than I'm used to. Overall, it was just okay- nothing to write home about.",1
"I could go on about my love for Xi'an Famous Foods. In fact I have, in reviews for different locations, so I'll keep it short this time around.Literally everything on the menu is incredible and you cannot go wrong. I personally love the N2 (spicy and tingly beef noodles), extra spicy and the tofu soup (major bang for your buck). I love how spacious this location is, especially with how much lunchtime midtown foot traffic there is. HOWEVER, if I had a dollar for every time the credit card system has been down, and I've had to pay cash, I'd be able to pay for almost an entire meal. I also find that the service is slower here than other locations. All in all, this has no effect on my love for the food, and I will continue to come back.",0
"Amazing experience here. A quick tip from a friend said if you have 5 people...there are only a couple tables that are five tops and sit by the fireplace in this shotgun styled restaurant. Crab cakes and Steak tartare for appetizer to start things off and everyone was blown away. Tartare had a small quail egg in center. Presentation was spot on. All of us ordered steaks, as we are from Midwest it was still hard to pass up. One of the best bone in ribeyes I have had. Friend got the strip which they pre cut and show the temperature of the hot plates by touching a piece of the strip on the plate to hear a quick siZzle. Family style sides were all very good. Creamer spinach, truffles taters and lobster Mac and cheese. The noodles were slightly firm in the Lobster Mac which I liked for this certain dish. One spot I'll be back too!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff is super friendly and they're always willing to help you with anything you need. The food is really good, too - I especially love the MANILA dish (crispy pork belly or grilled chicken, Chinese broccoli, bean sprouts, scallions, crispy garlic, crispy shallots, poached egg, adobo sauce). It's a great place to grab lunch or dinner, and it's also really healthy. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting New York!",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The atmosphere was loud and dark, and the food was mediocre at best. The drinks were also overpriced and too strong. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"This small ramen restaurant is popular among college students. The ramen is inexpensive and the servings are large, making it a good option for a quick meal. However, the soup is not very flavorful and the broth is not very salty. The meat is also a little too lean for our taste. The only thing really worth mentioning about this restaurant is the narutomaki - a dish made from fried salmon skin that is served with wasabi and soy sauce.",1
"Yelp rarely disappoints, so you can imagine our surprise when this experience wasn't the 4-5 star rating we were expecting. Here's the skinny: Pros: several dishes that we ordered were really delicious: beef fajitas, chicken enchiladas to name a few. Their guac and salsa were also great - spicy salsa, too. Pro and Con: We had a large party and made reservations ahead of time. As Mamacita's is already tiny, this was a possible mistake on our side, but without having been there before, we assumed that the option to make a large reservation also meant space to seat a large party. The staff made accommodations for us and even adjusted for the two extra folks that joined us. The down side here was that we were literally squeezed in like sardines and when a few of us had to leave to visit the restroom, three to four folks also had to get up and rearrange to allow each of us by, each time. Awkward. Cons: we ordered cocktails but sent several back and finally decided to forego drinks until our next stop. Our tequila soda as well as the vodka soda were very watered down with no carbonation. Maybe the gun was out of soda and they didn't realize. We also ordered a bottle of wine, enjoyed it and then waited and waited for the second bottle to arrive and finally cancelled it. We weren't sure they remembered that we even requested it. And lastly, the margaritas we were looking forward to enjoying didn't hit the spot. Several other service related issues happened throughout our dinner. Our waitress was clearly not happy and seemed to not want to be there. Several folks commented on this at different points throughout the evening. And then we realized that all meals have an added gratuity of 20% regardless of party size. Service wasn't a priority unfortunately.",0
"I visited this restaurant with a large group and was pleasantly surprised by the level of service. Some of our favorite dishes were the crispy pig ears, oxtail croquetas, and spiced goat neck. I ordered the crispy whole fish--which was a red snapper. It was delicious and very filling. My husband ordered the beef a broccoli. He didn't finish it, but I ate it the next day for lunch and it was super flavorful--a little on the greasy side, but tasted very good. I would definitely visit this restaurant again when I'm in the city.",1
"Food: I'm not going to lie, I was a little disappointed by Nino's 46. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the San Marzano pizza. The pasta was delicious. It was a little chewy and a good thickness which is just how I like my pasta. However, it didn't seem like there was any seasoning or flavor in the sauce. It looked like creamy tomato soup, there was no seasoning, spices, or anything. It was topped with ricotta cheese and basil which was something I had never seen before. I didn't hate it, however I did feel like the ricotta overpowered the sauce and made it a little too cheesy for me. The meatballs were amazing and a decent size. They had seasoning and they were really too huge for me to finish. Overall, It wasn't terrible. It was a nice meal for a day trip in New York, but I wasn't blown away and I probably would not order it again. The pizza, however, was amazing. Delicious. One of my top 5 pizzas. I loved everything, the crust was thin but the crust was fully, the cheese was melted perfectly and disturbed evenly, and the sauce was just the right amount. I would order the pizza again and again. Service: The waiter was a great waiter. He continuously checked our table, he was quick to get our waters and orders, and there was no problem with splitting our checks multiple ways. My water never went to less than half way before he came by and filled my water. The service was great and timely.Other: The atmosphere was a little dark, but the decor was nice. The paintings on the wall were a very unique, graffiti, pattern. Very cool vibe throughout the place.",0
"Vanessa's is overrated. The wontons I got were terrible; the dumpling skin was too thick, and the taste of the meat was overpowered. The wait was long, and there are better dumplings a few feet away. I feel bad being mean so come try it yourself and make your own decisions! There must be a lot of people here for a reason, right?",1
"Had high expectations for this place since it is consistently ranked highly (3 michelin stars) but I was unfortunately disappointed. First, when we entered, there were empty tables in the main hall but we were instead seated right next to the front door. That table was chilly since the door opened often and it was freezing outside (late Feb in NYC). I asked the staff to change tables and they politely assisted us so but the situation wasn't a welcome start. Second, we both did the chefs table and wine pairing but did not find it exceptional to justify 3 michelin stars. With the exception of the tuna and a handful other plates, the rest tasted a bit bland and I did not find them memorable or unique. In addition, I did not find the wine pairing selection extraordinary. Other similar restaurants in the City have more unique wine varieties. Third and most important, there was a hair in the egg dessert!!!! I was immediately disgusted and found this unacceptable for such a restaurant $$$$. I have been to many other michelin rated restaurants in the city and abroad and this place unfortunately underdelivered in my opinion. I wont be going back anytime soon.",0
I was pleasantly surprised by the Atrium dining space when I ascended the stairs. The bar is very cool and I saw a lone diner eating her lunch there. Two celebrities were having lunch a few seats away. The hosts were welcoming and BOULUD style unpretentious friendly servers served us. We both chose the 2 course menu but it was difficult to resist the beautiful dessert menu. The portions were ample for both appetizers and entrees. The avocado was very delectable but my dining partner was underwhelmed with the tuna all. The pasta with mushrooms was a salty mushy mess that made it inedible and my hazelnut crusted flounder with mushrooms was nicely prepared but the sauce was so oversalted. Someone in the kitchen needs to lighten their hand. The dining partner and I shared to taste each other's plates and we both agreed that this salt level of these dishes was overwhelming the beautifully plated food. I loved the ambiance and long pause between courses but I hope they can find the culprit sprinkling that salt!,1
"I had a pretty good experience at Sashimi Platter. The value is really good for the quality of the food. The only downside was that the chef's selected roll they gave us was salmon, which was a bit of a balance issue. The lobster soup dumpling was also good, but the execution could use a little improvement. Overall, it was a decent experience.",1
"A very professional, expensive, high-end restaurant.  Went there for a 25th anniversary dinner.We opted for a four-course prix fixe.  Very skillful hand in the kitchen; that said, while appetizers -- a lobster soup and grilled octopus - were outstanding, the rest of the meal was less so.  The pasta course was good, but not outstanding: while the squid ink pasta with seafood was very good, the seafood risotto was only okay (surprisingly fishy tasting).  Main course was good, but not great: a veal chop didn't have the kind of exterior crust /interior melt-in-your-mouth tenderness that one expects from a high-end Italian restaurant, and the duck, while good, didn't the kind of transcendent make-you-swoon deliciousness you expect when sending this much on a meal.  Dessert was fine.Wait staff was prompt and professional, but perhaps a bit over solicitous.  We don't need EVERYTHING on the menu explained to us... Room was pleasantly quiet - conversation could be conducted easily.  As to dress code - we were dressed in cocktail attire since it was a nice evening; I didn't see another suit and tie in the place - overall, a little under-dressed for so expensive a place, but that may be one of those post-COVID things that are here to stay.The wine list was extensive, excellent, and very costly; few bottles were under $100, and most, or at least many, were several hundred  dollars.  That takes a lot of... self-confidence.  In any case, here's the good news: the wines by the glass are excellent.  A super Tuscan was very good, and the pinot noir was excellent.One nit - I had left a note in either the reservation form or confirmation email that it was our 25th anniversary.  I didn't expect an orchestra, but I didn't expect it to go completely unnoticed, either.  A pity.For the cost, I think 4 stars in order.  Good, but not swoon-worthy.",0
"I had a great experience at My Drunken Man noodles! The food was delicious and the service was great. I only had one issue- I waited for someone to seat me and another woman walked in after me of a different race and when the waitress came up to us she looked and spoke to that lady even though I was standing in front of her. Honestly, I should of left but I really wanted to try their food and I was starving. Other than that, everything was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
"I went here at like 2am to get dumplings and I haven't regretted it. It is a great snack for unbelievably cheap. We got pork and chive dumplings for about $5, and they tasted just like what I would expect when I go to my friends' houses when I was younger. The service is great despite being busy all the time. While there is ample seating, it's often very full so sometimes people get dishes to go or just eat standing up. I would definitely recommend coming here for a cheap snack/meal.",0
"4.5 for the service, 1 for the food. I personally think this is a place that's selling more of its view (the vessel) than the actual food.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday. Didn't like the hostess's attitude downstairs. Once we got upstairs, we were welcomed warmly and were seated right away. Supposedly everything on the menu is family style and meant to share. We ordered octopus, Greek spread, and grilled whole fish of the day, plus spaghetti with butter sauce for the kids. First thing first, spaghetti was unbelievably bland, my kids usually eat restaurant pasta and they wouldn't take more than one bite. I tasted it and it's the worst kids pasta I've had anywhere in the city. Greek spread was okay - nothing amazing, in general lacking flavors. Octopus was very well cooked, came with hummus and onion, it was honestly the only good thing we had the whole lunch. Grilled whole fish was overcooked, period. Throughout lunch, service was very attentive and they kept on checking if we got everything we needed with kids. Overall, overpriced and very mediocre food (close to $200 including tip for above mentioned food). The opportunity cost is too high. We wouldn't come back here.",0
"This might be one of my new favorite places for ramen. I'm not a huge ramen guy but this takes all my praise. I love the broth and I love the thick wavy noodles. Most of all, I love the price and value. $17 for a lunch set - ramen and poke bowl. Thats hard to get anywhere else in the city. We came here Saturday 12:15 pm and waited 10 minutes for 2 people. When we left at 1:30pm there were open tables and no one waiting outside. Wait time wasn't terrible but it was packed when we first came.Expect seating to be crammed and your thigh close to touching another person's thigh. But its NYC so its part of the norm. ENJOY!",0
"Garlic naan is always good!But unfortunately, the entrees were just average to me. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. It is good enough where if the restaurant is on my way home and I'm craving Indian, I wouldn't mind ordering. The cocktails on the other hand was underwhelming and I would not order again. The wine was served in these tiny little glasses. Service was overall acceptable.",0
"I went here one night when I was able to get an 8:00 reservation and arrived over half an hour early but they were able to seat me.  The place is small with tables close together and a couple of larger booths.  The person next to me complained about the air conditioning being too cold and was given a free beer and they turned the a/c down.  I got too warm which made my meal less enjoyable than it might have been.  I ordered the branzino and a side of cheesy cauliflower. Some of the cauliflower were a bit burned but the taste was nice.  The branzino came with a nice pesto sauce-it was the whole fish that was mostly filleted but there were still a few bones.  The fish was cooked nice and the taste was very good.For dessert, the waitress let me know that the portions are smaller than many but are packed with flavor.  I had the carrot cake with ice cream.  The portion was just the right size for me.  They substituted the ice cream flavor which I appreciated and I enjoyed the dessert.  I'd go back again.",0
"My friend and I came to Mint Masala around 2:30pm on a Saturday.  We came across it walking down Macdougal looking for someplace to eat without a crazy line.  The shop is more of a take-out spot but there is seating for about 4-5 small parties.  My friend ordered the vegetarian lunch special ($9.95) and I got the poultry lunch special ($10.95).  We also added naan to the lunch special for $1.50.  The lunch special comes with a curry of the day, veggie side of the day, and rice.  It's a pretty good deal!  I believe my friend's curry was the palak paneer and mine was chicken tikka masala.  The side was a chickpea curry that was delicious!  I wish I just had the side as my full lunch!  I'm normally a big fan of the spinach curries, but my friend's tasted like baby food.  I wish it was more textured, less watery, and had stronger flavors.  The sauce of the chicken tikka masala was so off-putting to me.  It tasted more like tomato sauce and did not blend well at all with the chicken and rice.  I wish they had used the chickpea sauce for the chicken.  With the exception of a few charred end pieces, the naan was a generous portion and tasted good.The workers here are friendly and welcoming.  Service is what you would expect for more of a take-out place.  Overall, I think the lunch specials here are a fantastic deal but I would need to come back to find entrees that taste better.",0
"We had an hour wait to eat at the Pure Thai Cookhouse so decided to go to their sister restaurant as neither restaurants take reservations. Elite Tip: Obviously go during off hours or have a good alternative dining spot. I put me name down for a table and we decided to walk less than 4 NY minutes away to Taladwat; luckily, we got a table right away! Starting out the dinner without waiting made my night! Food really good for these Thai street food restaurant so just choose the 2 for $20 with some upgrade options. Enough Yelpers have already written about the food so I will keep it brief. Authentic Thai food with select choices of spicy and non-spicy small dishes with local NY and Thai beers!Next time we will have to leave room for dessert! The owner of this Thai place has gotten the right formula for success. Good food at a reasonable price with great vibe from the staff in a lively communal dining space.Zzz...",0
"Overall, I thought the food wasn't worth the price. The service was good, but I felt rushed at the end. I definitely recommend trying out another restaurant in the area.",1
"Fell a bit flat to me. The pho was spiced well and fragrant, but the broth itself is lacking, and I'm pretty sure fat and richness is what's missing. The cha gio we're really good, though bubbly rice paper wraps would have been my preference, still the inside was delicious. The pickled veg was also out of this world good. The bun was also just missing a little something; extremely average basically when I was expecting more. I think for the price they're is much better Vietnamese food experiences around. Service was good, atmosphere was upscale. Could probably get better bang for your buck elsewhere, but it certainly wasn't bad if you're near by.",0
"Solid.  Would recommend always. Needed a quick bite in between 2 birthday parties, I didn't want anything too heavy or time consuming. At $3.50 for a slice totally reasonable and love the quick grab and go! Don't let a line scare you, it moves quick! They do offer toppings and/or whole pies as well! Take out was pretty busy too. Joe's is a classic nyc spot!!!",0
"This place is awful.  Chicken isn't fresh.  Biscuits were cold.  They must get enough one-time business from travelers because they're clearly not trying for repeat customers even though they're in commercial district.  Save your money and try the other options here, or head to the east village location.",0
"Was skeptical at first because it seems like one of those places where you eat with your eyes and it won't be as good as when you actually eat it. However, the food was pretty good. Pricey, but pretty good. Be prepared for crowds swimming around the area to take photos with the flowers (spoiler alert, they're fake). The lines are relatively long and the wait would be over 1-2hrs. They start opening up for walk in dining at 5pm and I got there 10mins early but still had to wait an hour. It is a dreamy and aesthetically pleasing restaurant but is over crowded. The steak and fries were really good and had a nice char, though they gave us a way overcooked steak. Lamb chops were also delicious but under seasoned. I would pass on the spanakopita spring rolls, they were ok and overcharged. The drinks were amazing, absolutely loved the pineapple and jalapeño mocktail. Overall, not a place I would frequent back to given the stress of being surrounded by crowds taking pictures and another crowd waiting for a table. However, if you want to appreciate the aesthetics for IG and tiktok every now and then with cute drinks this is your spot!",0
"Ten Zaru was a big disappointment. My boyfriend ordered the cold soba with an assortment of tempura and he wasn't a fan. He found the soyu dipping sauce to be light and the dish to be overall bland. Kamo Nanban on the other hand, was a much better choice. The duck soba was delicious, with a rich and flavorful broth that complemented the duck well. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for something light and refreshing, but don't expect anything too special.",1
I go for the hangry to get the delicious salmon and lobster hand rolls. The iced green tea is very authentic!,0
"For a BRAND NEW restaurant, our experience here was great.  Staff was very attentive and did a great job of explaining the menu items to us.  The decor is a delight with comfortable seating in a well balanced setting of modern and rustic.  It absolutely added to the overall meal experience.Now the food....For starters we had Empanadas, Corn Fritters, and the Cottage Pie.  All were really incredible.  My son loved the cottage pie so much, he wished it was a stand alone entree on the menu.Of the entrees ordered, two stood out above the rest:  Pork Chop and Shrimp/Grits.  My first bite of the pork chop shook me to the core.  While it looked like a giant ham steak - it tasted like pork heaven.  I can't wait to eat it again as I am sure it will stay on the new menu for a long time.And I give a lot kudos to the Shrimp & Grits.  Beyond being perfectly cooked, the shrimp carried a lot of flavor but it was the grits that stole the show.  The chef managed to get so much create seafood flavor into the corn mush that made the eating experience a coastal delight in every bite.  Just great!",0
"I had high expectations for baby brasa but my experience turned out to be quite underwhelming. First off, the menu isn't very vegetarian friendly, nor do they have many chicken options. I was hoping to order the chicken empanadas or the chicken skewers but they were out of both of those. I ended up having to order the grilled chicken and I was shocked at how small it was for the price I paid. The chicken was pretty simple and tasted like something anyone could easily cook at home. The rice was REALLY salty so that didn't help either. The tables were so wobbly that one of my friends drinks got spilled over. Luckily our waiter was really nice and replaced his drink at no extra charge. I will say the vibe here is pretty nice. All the plants and floor to ceiling glass windows are a nice touch. I just hope they get better at improving their options, portion sizes and making sure the meals are in stock.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The 8oz ribeye was a good size and the Parm fries were delicious. I found the steak to be very flavorful on its own, without any added spices. The Parm fries were also enjoyable, with a crispy exterior and plenty of Parmesan cheese inside. Overall, a great meal at a great price. I only wish the cookies were from here, as they were a little too sweet for my taste.",1
"This place is pretty much my go-to place if I'm near Washington Square Park. I've been here many times but this time I came here for dinner with a group of 8 people on a Monday night.  They accommodated us with barely any wait.  We ordered 2 appetizer platters (3 appetizers: curry puff, chicken satay, fried calamari), whole fried red snapper with papaya salad, roast duck with udon noodles, spicy basil fried rice with grilled chicken, kua gai noodles, shrimp with vermicelli noodles in a clay pot, and chicken massaman curry.  All the dishes were cooked well and flavorful.  The best dish was the whole fried red snapper with papaya salad.  I always enjoy the kua gai noodles and spicy basil fried rice as well.  The portions were large and the prices were decent.  Also, you can get 10% off your check if you pay with cash.  FYI - you get Thai iced tea for $1 with Yelp check in.",0
"Amazing location. Arrived around 5pm for happy hour on a Friday night to celebrate a friends birthday. Immediately seated. Drink orders were placed as well as food. All drinks were great and strong and were $5 (beer $3) and food was $10 each item. Both were brought out promptly. The food ordered was calamari (hot, well seasoned, and NOT chewy), empanadas (tasted fresh and sauce on the side...a ketchup/mayo with seasoning), buffalo wings (what's expected), and chicken fingers and fries (very good chicken fingers and nicely fried fries). Occasionally we had to find someone to order more drinks but it wasn't too bad. The music was good from the moment we were seated. Around 8pm they turned the lights on outside and a live DJ started playing. DJ Leslie was the absolute best!!! I definitely recommend. Just note. Gratuity was automatically added to our bill and we were only a group of 4 for an hour then 3 the rest of the time.",0
"Overall, the food wasn't too bad, but I was a bit disappointed. The prices are standard for NYC restaurants, so if you're looking for something affordable, this place could be a good option. However, if you're looking for something more flavourful or special, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",1
"Pretty tasty dishes, but not great value. I got the Pork Jowl, and the pork was cooked so well- the outside was slightly crispy while the inside actually had a bit of a creamy consistency (in a good way) because of how soft it was. The sauce added a nice sweet and savory flavor, while the tiny olive bits on top were a nice touch. However, Mokyo really isn't kidding when they say they serve small plates. Each plate is small and the portion sizes are even smaller, only filling up about half of each small plate. Therefore, in order to have a full meal, you will definitely need to order at least 3 of these plates. Considering that the prices for each plate are in the mid to high teens (the pork jowl was $16), this will lead to a rather pricey bill that, despite the tasty dishes, I personally do not think can be reasonably justified. I would much rather go somewhere else for a full meal at the price of a single plate at Mokyo, even if the food quality was a bit lower.Also, the service speed was quite slow, as I had to wait over 20 minutes for my single small plate. That being said, the staff are fairly friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to the menu options.Overall, despite having high quality small dishes, Mokyo does not offer a good bang for your buck, so I would personally choose a better value place to visit.",0
"I stopped by Ichiba Ramen on accident and it turned out to be a great decision. The door to this restaurant is a bit hidden, but there's a giant ""Ichiba Ramen"" sign above the front of the restaurant. I was actually looking for another business on this street, but I walked in and the host immediately greeted me and gave me a menu. I told her no thank you, but then I remembered I just so happened to be craving ramen for lunch, so I asked her if they do takeout. They do, but I said ""eff it"" and dined in.

The waiter was very nice. I asked him how spicy the spicy ramen was and he was SO on the mark and even gave comparisons from other menu items. It had a hint of spice but not too spicy. There were other non-spicy labeled items that he claimed were ""painful spicy,"" so I really appreciated his honesty. The food came out pretty quick, too. The spicy ramen with braised beef was just the right amount of spicy and I appreciated the hearty portion at only $12. The beef was well flavored and perfectly cooked, and they give you a lot of it. There was a good balance of noodles",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The staff was very friendly and professional and the food was amazing. I especially loved the ketel one vodka that I had, it had some great botanical flavors. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing evening out.",1
"I'm not sure what it is about Caribbean restaurants, but their cabbage and rice and beans always taste better the next day. That said, Peppas is a great place to go for mac and cheese. The oxtail was perfect, and I can't wait to go back and try the jerk chicken.",1
"Love myself some good pizza and pasta. This place has a limited menu, but has lots of different good options. I split the pizza and pasta with my dinner date and it was perfect! The pizza was cooked just right and the pasta was not over sauced. Overall, I would suggest to anyone!  It made for a great date night. I suggest making a reservation because they get very busy. Outdoor seating does not have heaters so it is not ideal as we approach colder weather.",0
"I recently visited Jongro with a party of 4 people. Overall, we really enjoyed the experience! The only negative part of the experience was trying to join the waitlist for a table. It was crowded and chaotic near the entrance, and the process for joining the list was unclear. However, once we were able to join the list everything was much smoother. Even though it was very busy, they did a great job of turning tables quickly and keeping the wait time short. For our group of 4, we ordered a large beef platter, pork belly, and a side of rice cakes. In terms of portion sizing, I would say that the large platter was enough meat without the additional order of pork belly. All of the complimentary side dishes were delicious, and the meats we ordered tasted high quality. The cocktail selection was pretty small, but all of them the group tried were really good as well.",0
Pretty good Thai food. I ordered the thai basil fried rice and pad see ew. I enjoyed the meal. Savory flavors and good for a quick meal to order to go!,0
"Ponty is just soo good!! Good vibes, and good drinks and the staff is great, full of humor but respectable. Even though I love the brunch, they have great lunch, dinner and dessert!! Owner/chef always come around to greet his customers, such a nice friendly guy with a humble spirit. I will eat the french toast and have a supreme Mimosa everytime!!",0
"Trying to find a restaurant to impress on a date, and I think I overdid it. I guess that's not a bad thing, but my wallet feels quite a bit lighter in my pocket. Heidelberg is a step above German themed. It's trying to be actual Germany in the middle of NYC. All of their dishes - appetizers, mains, sides - and drinks are German. Their specials are German. Their kids' menu is German themed. No escape, no choice, so just sink in and enjoy it. I know my date enjoyed her food, but I did not grab a taste (bad Yelper!) so I can't comment. My own roast duck was very nice and a nice size for the price. I can't say the same for the beer, it's decent but very expensive and a couple of drinks will end up nearly doubling your food bill. (The appetizer didn't help, even though we just shared one. The fried cheese wheel was tasty but quite small for the price.)In the end, I don't feel angry enough about the bill to dock more than one star for what's otherwise a fine restaurant, but I will go so far as to say that the German food is very good but would only be borderline 5 stars with all else equal, so it's not that difficult a choice to arrive at 4. During COVID the place is relatively sparsely attended (this was on a Sunday admittedly) and with these prices, I think you would much rather dine in vs. out and get your money's worth. Save it for a special occasion or when your German great-aunt visits. Prost!",0
"Overall, I thought the food was good, but I prefer Galata or Hummus Kitchen. The waitstaff could be more attentive and the noise level was a bit too loud for my liking. The prices are reasonable, but I would've liked to see a bit more variety in the mezze menu.",1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! The people who work here are so friendly and the food is amazing. I ordered delivery and the squash cassoni was so good that I needed another one to take home with me. The tomato, bufala mozzarella, arugula, basil piadine with balsamic glaze was also delicious. The only downside was that the piadine was soggy. I hope that this was just a one-time occurrence and that the delivered items always turn out this well. I'm a big fan of bufala music and non solo and I'm excited to keep supporting this restaurant.",1
"The bagels at this shop are overpriced, but they're still good. They're a bit pricey for a plain cream cheese bagel, but I think the shop is cute, so it's worth it. I definitely want to try dining here one day.",1
"Overall, I thought the food was good. The calamari was especially good, but the pork chop was a bit of a let-down. The service was good, but I would have liked to see a side dish or vegetable with my pork chop. The cheesecake was a bit dry, but my friend's dessert was delicious. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
Sylvia's Restaurant is a great place to go for a Chickn out! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. The prices were reasonable and the portions were huge. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.,1
We really love Sophra Grill...their chicken is a staple in our house because my husband and daughter really love it. I personally love their grape leaves.Prices are very reasonable and the staff is quite friendly. We're so glad Sophra was able to make it through the worst of the pandemic and hope they stick around for a long time!,0
"I had a decent time at II Buco. The spaghetti and ravioli were both great, but the cheese toast wasn't my favorite. The service was attentive, and the atmosphere was comfortable. The only downside was that the spaghetti was a bit salty for my taste.",1
"I will admit that I only came here because it was the only sit-down restaurant that was open in the area around 10 pm. For my dining experience, I went with the stuffed mushrooms and chicken piccata. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty much on point, but I found the chicken piccata a bit too lemony for my tastes. The service was pretty good because the waiter constantly checked in on me. While I would not go out of my way to dine at Italian Village Pizzeria, the food was ok, especially for late-night dining. For this review, I'd probably give the food a 3.5 and the service a 4.",0
"Olio e Piú has been my favorite NYC restaurant for years. The food is consistently delicious, great service, and incredible ambiance. The patio has always been my ideal location for a table. I went with my go-to pizza - The Margherita. It's simple and quite possibly my favorite pizza in general. The crust is light with a doughy bite.The Clam Linguini was fresh and plenty for two to share. It could have used a bit more salt or lemon but it was still extraordinary. It was my first time trying this dish and I'm happy I did!We ordered the white fish, squid, and shrimp appetizer, which comes lightly deep fried. It's a perfect dish for 2-4 people, depending on your level of hunger. Bare in mind there are only 2 shrimp but they're huge! So yummy.The service was fantastic as always. Today we had the pleasure of sitting in Petar's section. Thank you for yet another wonderful experience. I'm sure we'll visit a few more times before our trip back home to LA. Thanks!",0
"Legit Thai food! Quirky decor. Shared picnic tables. The Pick n' Mix was a nice way to get half-orders and be able to try more dishes.THE WAIT: None at 5pm on a Sunday; they were pretty empty. By 7pm they were full and had a short wait.THE COST: $103 total including tips for three. Reasonable!THE SERVICE: Attentive, and patient with us as we waited a bit for a friend.MUST-HAVES: Turmeric Curry Chicken (4.5 stars), Tepo Curry Pork Belly (4.5 stars).See my photos for additional details!",0
I tried their vegan options and I was not satisfied. I normally get veggie pizza even (non vegan pizza) and for some reasons these were just dry even with the sauces. The Zen pizza was a bit good with the pesto but it was still a bit bland. I have had other vegan pizzas that were full of flavor and these do not compare. The servings are huge but not flavorful.,1
"Great vibe A great service great food - although pricey... most items on the Brunch menu are ala carte- order an omelette- you get an omelette- hash browns- bacon, fries or toast is extra. BUT - you will have one of the best omelettes E V E R! Insanely delicious- light fluffy - like no other omelette I have ever had. Drinks are great - pricey - but hey it's Tribeca - it's the 'scene' it is a crazy reservation to even get... I would highly recommend- you cannot go wrong here - we will be back for dinner or lunch soon!",0
"I stopped by The Scotch on West 4th Street a few weeks ago and I have to say, it's not what it used to be. The gastropub for Scotch connoisseurs is a unique spot in the West Village, but now it's a young party scene and lost a bit of its luster. What's to cheer- one of the best and most comprehensive lists of Scotch in the city! What's to jeer- super crazy loud music- bad music - crowd mismatches the drinks menu now. Everyone in their 20s drinking vodka cocktails or beer- it's expensive- services isn't great.",1
"Almond is a brunch spot that I would only recommend to people if they're looking for something quick and easy. The food wasn't particularly to my liking, and the waitstaff wasn't very attentive. The only thing that made it bearable was the bread basket that my fiancé had previously recommended.",1
I had the chicken pad Thai here for dinner and it was delicious! The noodles were cooked well and a bit thinner than most restaurants I've tried. There was freshly sliced chicken and raw bean sprouts and peanut garnish off on the side. Can't wait to try some of the other items on their menu!,0
"The delicious sound of garlic noodles with soft shell crab had me scrambling to eat here as soon as they reopened this month. Their menu, which they describe as ""Vietnamese comfort food,"" lists inventive and amazing sounding dishes like a banh mi burger and fish sauce wings. There's a widely held belief among NY foodies that there's no good Vietnamese food to be found anywhere in the city, but I think the entrance of Saigon Social to the scene challenges that, at least a little bit.The garlic noodles were a standout among the dishes I ordered, and though it only came with two small pieces of crab, which you pay a premium for, the generous portion of the noodles more than made up for it. I had enough to eat as leftovers the next day and this delicious oily, carby dish was just the salve I needed after a night filled with one too many margaritas.I wanted a small side to snack on with my noodles, but this meat-heavy menu left me with a lone meatless option, the tater tots. The lemongrass aioli that it came with was pretty good, but tots are just tots. Unless this is precisely what you're craving, I'd skip over this order. My partner opted with the more exciting fish sauce wings and said they were enough to be a full entree. I hope they keep adding new items to their menu because the culinary aptitude of the chef is so evident from the dishes available on their short menu. I can't wait to return for another takeout order.",0
"The food was really good at this restaurant. The experience could be better though because it was a little ""off"" in terms of atmosphere. The food was good though, and the portions were small so it can be a bit pricey. The servers were fast and impersonal though. I think the owners wanted this restaurant to be more affordable and for the masses, but because the portions are so small, you end up spending a lot of money. I would have liked to have seen this restaurant on a tasting menu so I could have had a high-end experience, but because the food was great, I'll round up to a 3.5.",1
"Overpriced. Bland. Greasy. These are some of the words I would use to describe Hudson Malone. The space is nice, our servers were nice enough too, but it is hard to get over the high price tag to get not even mediocre food. The picnic chicken was almost tasteless, onion rings were just pure grease with no other discernible flavor. The mashed potatoes were excellent, but nobody goes to a place like this to only eat a vat of mashed spuds. We had a large party and almost everyone was universally disappointed with the meal - from the flavors being off to the plates arriving cold. Definitely doesn't live up to the hype!",0
"5 Napkin took some time to grow on me.  I've been living in the neighborhood almost a decade now, and rarely ever went.In the last few months, I've been more often though.  5 Napkin Burger is a 3.5 star restaurant, and I'm bumping them up to 4 because they do a lot of fun promotions and limited time stuff.  The burgers have been quite good when I've ordered.  They have good basics and cook a medium rare burger properly, and they also have a variety of burgers with interesting and varied flavors.  The fries are good, and come in crinkle or waffle shapes.  Burgers and fries are definitely the staples here and they do them well.The salads are mostly good - not amazing, but they're solid.  I've had salmon on a salad here and it was surprisingly well cooked for salmon at a burger place.  The brussel sprouts were another pleasant surprise, ask for them extra crispy.  Finally, I quite enjoyed the boozy peppermint mocha coffee as a night cap.",0
"Came for dinner with a friend. The place is decorated beautifully, but the chairs are not comfortable and look like crap. The staff is awesome. The menu was interesting and the food was solid for the most part. We ordered an appetizer sized portion of risotto to start. It had a really good flavor, but it was undercooked. The rice was way too hard and not pleasant. The peas in the dish sort of overpowered it too. For our entrée we shared a 16 Oz ribeye. It was served with a hassle back potato and a fennel, red onion salad. This was delicious. We also ordered 2 sides. Asparagus and sautéed broccoli rabe. The asparagus was perfectly seasoned and cooked well. The broccoli rabe was okay. The waitress surprised us with a delicious dessert to make up for the risotto. I would definitely come back to try the pasta.",0
"Tonight I enjoyed my meal at Elite Williamsburg.  I came here with a group of 7 at 8pm on Sunday to celebrate my cousin birthday. The security guard at the door was professional and informed us of the dining rules due to covid. He checked our temperature before allowing us to enter. Since we were a large party we dined in their igloos on their rooftop. Was a very nice ambience, warm, and came with Bluetooth speakers for us to play our own music. Our waiter informed us the kitchen closed at 9:15 and made sure we got our orders in at a timely manner. Lobster mac&cheese - Phenomenal (highly recommend)  Popcorn Chicken - Very FlavorfulThug Passion - very strong drink (if you prefer something softer / sweeter i do not recommend) Unfortunately members of our party were late so our experience was rushed. I would have to come back and dine without having to worry about the NYC curfew. I strongly suggest being on time for your reservation.",0
"Updated review: I was invited to try the tasting menu. Jasmine was gracious and attentive and explained all of the authentic Chinese cuisines. The tasting menu had large portions and more unusual dishes than on the regular menu. My friend and I enjoyed the calimari, succulent chicken and seafood dishes. Thank you for showing us what your restaurant is capable of!",0
"I was so excited to try out this Thai restaurant in New York City, and I'm glad I did! There's a great selection of dishes from salad, appetizers, main courses, and desserts, all of which are mouth-wateringly delicious. My favorite dish was the curry puff appetizer - it was bursting with flavor and very satisfying. The tilapia fish green curry was also very good, and the mango sticky rice was a must-try. The service was attentive and our server patiently explained the menu. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"Food was not bad. Lots of interesting dishes though a little bit generic taste wise.  My favorite was probably the Cheesy Rabbit dessert, which was a custard-y pudding thing shaped like a rabbit.  The tripe with sesame sauce was also good, but when it first came out was a bit bland so we asked for more sauce.  I noticed another review that said all the food was too salty - maybe just inconsistent depending on the day?Lots on the menu - I would probably be back to try some of the other dishes.",0
"I really enjoyed my meal at Jiang's! The food came quickly and was piping hot. The lamb ribs were my favorite dish - they were so tender and delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal. The only downside is that the food is a bit salty for some people, but overall I was very pleased.",1
"I love macaroni and cheese, and I do come here ever so often, but the main thing that strikes me about this tiny mac joint is the gimmicky design. The elbow shape of a macaroni noodle can be found in both the container in which your mac arrives and the layout of the shop itself, strangely. When it comes to the layout, on the off chance that I do snag a spot before one of the four small tables in the place, I can't help but sit and ponder how they could've maximized the cramped space if someone had just ditched the idea to make the store look like a noodle.

I get that publicity is a big part of running a restaurant in New York City these days, but please consider this. Influencers need only visit a place once to get their pictures taken eating somewhere trendy; real customers will return if the food and experience are good.

All that out of the way, the mac + cheese is pretty alright. I've gone a handful of times in the past few months and never seen the same person working, but they've all been polite enough. They DO have Sriracha!",1
"Went here for my birthday and had a great experience. The staff was A1! Courteous, attentive and friendly. Classy restaurant, 100% quality service, spectacular view of the city and amazing food. I'd definitely return and would highly recommend to everyone.",0
"Note: Cash onlyThis is a small place where walk down a couple of steps to go into the restaurant.  They take phone orders or you can wait on line, where you listen to your order number (the cardboard laminated number).  There are a few seats -- 2 tables (4 chairs each).  It's a limited menu but they do what they do well -- rice noodles or cheurng fun!  On this day, I didn't want meat so I choose curry fish ball rice rolls.  When you order, make sure to tell them if you want any condiments on your rice rolls such as melted peanut butters, sweet sauce, sesame or hot sauce.  Don't forget to indicate your order size (S, L) and dine-in or take-out.You can see the employees working really hard to make your rice noodles in several ovens.  So have some patience despite the long wait.If you get a chance, don't forget to try the soy milk ($1).Hope you get to enjoy!",0
"The restaurant was nicely decorated and had a lovely interior. There are two floors and a private section which is great for company events. The service was amazing, really friendly and welcoming staffs. However, I did wish the food was as good as the service here. I ordered the the lychee & rose martini, yuzu soju, yellow tail sushi, grilled scallops, black cod, mushrooms, tiger prawn, two desserts: one was a sweet potato ice cream and another banana and matcha bread. Highly recommend the martini and black cod (so buttery and paired nicely with the sauce they provided) as they were my favorites throughout the meal. The sushi, grilled scallops were good but the avocado to fish ratio for the sushi was a little off and the grill scallops lacked flavor. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the mushroom and tiger prawn as both were too salty. To my surprise, I did like the sweet potato ice cream with pecan. The banana and matcha bread was a big no from me. It was too sweet and you barely taste any matcha. Hope to see them improve some of the dishes! Definitely will be back for martinis and the black cod!",0
"I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant! The food was great and the service was friendly. I only had one issue, which was that it took a little bit too long for my delivery to come. However, the burger I got was still delicious and cooked to my liking. I would definitely recommend this spot to others.",1
"I had stumbled upon this while walking around the Garment District. It is a very small place, on a side street. There is no indoor seating but they have an outdoor seating area. They specialize in Italian street food, a grab and go concept which for the area where they are located, is very convenient. I looked over the wall menu and decided on getting the Romagnola-it consists of Prosciutto di Parma with baby arugula [make sure you like it-mine came with a great deal of it] along with stracchino cheese. I waited outside in the sitting area and my meal was brought to me. It was delicious. It is pricey and if you use a credit card, there is 3% charge for doing so. The Romagnola was $13.75. However, it was a good sandwich. I did not see people paying in cash but you must be able to do so-I would recommend and return. Their menu is extensive.",0
"Cute, eclectic eatery in a convenient location. Stopped in after an afternoon of shopping. The drinks and bar bites were delicious and the overall vibe provided a good atmosphere for the drinks. Highly recommend. The service was slow, however.",0
"Came here for lunchPros:- Goat cheese salad was great. It came with a lot of cheese, cranberries, and applesCons:- Fries that came with the burgers were very stale and could tell has been sitting out for a while - The chicken that came with the goat cheese salad was not good. Could definitely tell it was frozen beforehand",0
"I went to Churutto this evening for dinner and while the food was pretty good, the service was very slow. Ramen doesn't normally take that long. The broth is already cooked (they advertised that it was cooked for up to 8 hours), the noodles only take a few minutes to make, and the toppings are typically prepared in advance. The frustrating thing was that other people arrived after us and their ramen came out before ours. I would have given Churutto four stars had the food not taken as long. Anyway, on to the food.Ordered:Chicken buns ($6)- I enjoyed the chicken buns. It had crispy karaage, a slice of cucumber and a spicy mayo and a brown sauce. There were three chicken pieces in each bun. It was hard to pick it up and eat the bun because some of the chicken would fall out, but the flavors worked well together. Chicken ramen ($13.50)- the broth was a salty and creamy chicken broth, it had pieces of chopped dark meat chicken, al dente noodles, nori, spinach and a soft boiled egg. I'd order this dish again. I may give Churutto another chance, but not when I'm very hungry. They also have poke on the menu and I saw a bunch of people ordered it. That might be something to try.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The pasta dishes were all really good and my table ordered the Carbonara and Bolognese. I thought the Bolognese was better than the Carbonara, although it was a bit oily. But the service was great and I would definitely go back.",1
"The Korami team puts on an excellent show with their 15-course omakase menu. The style is traditional-leaning, and they don't put crazy things on top of your fish for shock value; their focus is on great fish quality and excellent, consistent execution. This has become a reg spot for my friends, and it's a small and (good noisy) with quick turnover of seats so you'll be done in 60 mins for the next seating to takeover. Def worth a visit for great omakase that won't break the bank.",1
"we struggled for an hr to decide if we should go to a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown vs Malaysian restaurant. We landed-up going to Nyonya and it was worth it. the reviews speaks for itself ...prompt service, reasonable cost, portions are generous and food is delicious! we tried: Hainanese Chicken- can be an acquired taste but worth trying for sauce Nasi Lemak- delicious curry. Absolute must! Ginger Duck- different but not bad (can't decide if i like or not)Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo- delicious.",0
"I recently came back to Crispo after many years. I was here early for a dinner reservation, but the hostess was very kind and offered me a table before my friend got there. Between the two of us we ordered pasta dishes, a couple glasses of wine and coffee. Everything felt wholesome and very Italian! I really like this spot and look forward to coming here again.",1
"The good - a proper counter place with made-to-order slices, your pick of toppings, and just the right amount of greaseThe bad - the pizza crust needed to be crispier on the bottom and the garlic knots weren't goodIf you're looking for a classic NY slice, you can do better.",0
"Soba azuma is an excellent choice when the weather is hot, as the noodles are very refreshing and the chicken egg rice is delicious. The price is also very reasonable for New York standards. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I visited this restaurant for dinner and I was a bit disappointed. The Panang curry was good, but the Kui Teiw Kua Ped with tofu was not as good. The bill was $47 with tax and tip, which is a bit on the expensive side. I don't think the food was that great, but it wasn't bad either. I would probably not come here again.",1
"Squid Ink cocktail was interesting but taste normal too. Complimentary Bread Dip looks like they have been sitting out for hours and dried on the outside, not a good way to present. Lobster Pasta - pretty good but not as amazing as everyone was raving about to me.Chicken Meatball daily special - usually not my type of dish but probably was the highlight of the meal!",0
"Came here for Christmas Eve dinner. Super super busy inside and no social distancing, we say outdoors, they have heaters. Soup of day when we went was a potato leek. It was good but not very hot. The first bread they gave us was hard/stale. Second batch was better warm and soft. I got the risotto but honestly did not like it. I never heard of red peppers in a risotto. My friend had the salmon and I ate some of it that's the only dish out of everyone's that I would recommend.",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The chicken tray is a must-get, and it's always delicious. It can feed 2-3 people and it's always spicy, but the chicken is cooked well and full of flavor. The place is small and service is typical for a Chinese restaurant, but it's fast and generally during lunch and dinner times expect a small wait. Their other dishes are also good, such as their dumplings. I highly recommend this restaurant and I've been back a few times!",1
"I had a decent brunch at this spot, but it's not worth all the hype. The wait was pretty long and we ended up sitting outside which wasn't very comfortable. The food was good though, especially the Farm Stand eggs which were simple scrambled eggs, bacon and some toast.",1
"I was really excited to try this restaurant, but unfortunately it was not worth the wait. The line was out the door and I decided to see what the hype was all about. Since the salad line was busy, I went for their soup section to skip the crowd. Ordered a small broccoli and cheddar soup, which tasted no different than a Tostitos cheese dip mixed with a few pieces of broccoli. That work of art was $6 before tax. I'd rather go to Hale & Hearty. Also got a piece of cornbread, which at 3 bucks, was again not worth the high price tag. After paying for my item, the cashier asked if I wanted bread. When I asked if I could return the cornbread (which I didn't touch) since I didn't know the soup came with bread, the cashier, with a straight face, said no. Not the best customer service model for a company. Also, they may want to transition the bread giving process from the cashier side to the soup section similar to other businesses to appeal to common sense.",1
"We came back to celebrate a birthday and this time around it was not that good of an experience. We decided to order the usual and although the prices are consistent, the food unfortunately is not. The good:-Yakitori Combination: Barbecued very nicely and all of the meats were tender. -Takoyaki: Good amount of octopus, crispy exterior, fluffy interior, and generous condiments.-Beer: Nothing much to say, alcohol here is cheap.

The bad:-Service: Waitress was rude. Hostile to us when we went in. Intentionally ignored us when we asked for the bill so we had to get another waitress. I always give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to service because I've worked in the food industry before so I understand that it can get busy. But this time was too hard to ignore. Not to mention we went right during opening and were one of the first ones to get seated so I don't know what could be angering her. Even when things were tough for me outside of work I never let it reflect in my attitude and make sure to respect my customers so I expect the same respect from others.

The rest of us ordered stir fried udon, fried",1
"The food was really good at both of their Union Square and Midtown locations. The fries were especially delicious, and my friend enjoyed her wings and tuna rolls. My husband ordered the table bbq, and he found the beef tender but felt that they should have trimmed the fat when they served it. I had a soju all by myself - bad decision for a light drinker!!! It was a bit noisy, but not too much compared to other similar establishments and difficult to have a conversation. Service was quite slow for a busy restaurant, but they did move us along eventually. Overall, a good experience.",1
Sandwich looked sad when I got it because they fill it with lettuce (which I knew and opted out of) BUT the falafel themselves were quite good. This was on my must eat places in NYC... and I stumbled upon it so it was fate. Would recommend for a quick cheap ($5) eat!,0
"This used to be one of my favorite AYCE hot pot chains but the quality of the food has dropped so much or I've been going to places that are just better. Yesterday I went with a couple of friends to eat here. I got the pork bone soup broth and after eating my beef from cooking it in there, it was not as good as I remember it. In terms of ordering, they do have a cool system where you scan a QR code on the table and then you can order your food. However, it's not so effective. For the different menu items, you cannot select a quantity and a random amount will come out. We had to order corn of 4 separate occasions before they finally came out with only 4 pieces of corn. The next time we ordered corn after that, they came out with 6 pieces. The first time we ordered beef (we had a party of 6), they only gave us 2 platters which disappeared really quick. When we ordered it again, they only gave 1 platter. For making your own sauce, they wheel around a cart where they have all the sauces in bottles or containers that you use a spoon to take out. One of my friends wanted to use the shacha sauce and that thing was DRIED OUT so who knows how long it has been sitting there. The customer service was okay as well. The quality of the beef was not that good as well and I don't think I will be coming back to 99 again. They are just not what they used to be.",0
"I came here on a Thursday night for dinner with my sister.  I read about this place and was excited to check it out.  It's located in the Wyndham hotel so it's a strange location for a ramen place.  My sister ordered the famous bone marrow gyukotsu ramen and I ordered the smoked duck ramen.  I've not had such tasty and interesting ramen in a while.  The bone marrow ramen had nice pieces of brisket and the bone itself was quite large.  The presentation for the smoked duck ramen was just so cool.  They serve the ramen in a glass dome filled with smoke (yes, very extra).  The duck actually has a good smokey flavor.  I also liked that there were lotus root, bok choy, and carrots in the smoked duck ramen since I like vegetables.  Service was very friendly and fast.  I would definitely come to try their other ramen.  They also have a good happy hour until 7 PM ($3 snacks, BOGO drinks).  FYI - you get a free order of edamame with Yelp check-in.",0
This is for delivery. Ordered the chicken parm with penne and the garlic knots. My order arrived faster than expected which is amazing! Everything was packed very neatly. Everything arrived hot. There was some of their garlic bread which was good. They also sent some extra parm and red pepper flakes (which I love!). The chicken was a little on the dry side but a great portion and great flavor! Lots of cheesy goodness! The marinara was fresh and tasted great! Not acidic. The garlic knots had fresh garlic and good mix of herbs. Would love more garlic throughout or smaller garlic knots; I've had better. I would definitely order the chicken parm again! The penne was cooked perfect too. Prices aren't bad. Great portions. Very happy with Patzeria!!,0
I was really pleased with my experience at Harry's Pizza. The service was prompt and the pizza was delicious. I especially loved the outdoor seating area which was great for people to stop by and eat during lunch time. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great pizza at a great price.,1
"I recently visited Chinatown and found the restaurant to be very busy. The road was barricaded and it was difficult to navigate. We eventually found our way there, but it was a bit of a walk. The restaurant was a busy store front. We ordered three rice crepes: curry fish balls, shrimps and pork. The crepes were very soft, even after a while had passed. The staff was friendly, but it was clear that there was a wait. The sauce was good with the crepes.",1
"Got takeout from here on February 21. I've eaten here pre-COVID and the food was always great. You can never go wrong with beef noodles and pickled cucumbers. The meat is always tender and the broth is super rich. The acid from the cucumbers cuts through the richness and brightens up the whole meal.The small side of lu rou fan was yummy and with that superbly cooked egg, delicious. The set with all three was $30, a little pricey for the portion size but I'm a firm believer of quality over quantity and everything at Ho Foods is awesome so still definitely recommend",0
"I visited brunch at this restaurant for my birthday and it was a great experience! The drinks were strong and the food was not bad at all. The eggs benny and the kobe burger were both great, but I did not enjoy the lobster roll. The service was great and the restaurant was always full, which made it feel like a busy place. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a fun brunch with friends.",1
"This restaurant is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. The food is really good, especially the chicken and calamari appetizers. The service is also great. I would definitely come back.",1
"I was disappointed with my visit to this restaurant. The Sicilian Pepperoni and thin cheese slice were not that great. The Sicilian was burned on the sides. The slice is virtually no taste. Definitely no real taste. Like a lot of places there are a few ""eat while you stand"" tables. The corner location gives good view of the busy streets and good sunlight. However, there is no indoor or outdoor seating.",1
"I have been cruising around on this boat for many spring and summers - have not visited since the pandemic. It was so nice to introduce this experience to my dear friend today.I remember I used to go on the boat for free and we would have a dinner and some drinks (going by the honor system here). Unfortunately, this is long gone and to be admitted on the one hour cruise adventure, it costs $10. The $10 does not roll over to use on board. A great NYC secret may have been discovered and it was good while it lasted. Lobster dinner with potatoes and corn $55. The menu offers several types of lobster rolls (starting at $28 per roll) they even have a truffle roll. A chicken sandwich option, popcorn shrimp, oysters. From what I remember, the lobster was always over cooked here and the rolls were nothing special to write home about. It most certainly could have changed in the past couple of months. Beers start at $9 and cocktails are about $14-16. The manager of the boat was very kind and hospitable. Our waiter was also really kind. I give the service five stars from start to finish. You go very slowly along the water so it's enjoyable while dining, some music, and get to pass Jersey City and back. For those visiting out of NYC, no Statue of Liberty tour or anything. I most likely won't return again in the future due to being charged to get on the boat but I would certainly go back if this concluded and go back to ordering dinners. It's really about the experience here and not so much the best lobster experience.",0
"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Hama Japanese Cuisine. The food was good, albeit a bit salty for my taste, and the service was great. I especially appreciate the last call reminder, which ensured that we didn't leave without getting our food. The only downside was the squid, which was a bit bland and could use some salt or seasoning.",1
"This place is right next to my office, and it is a go-to for the local power lunch. The food is actually pretty good, and the presentation is thoughtful.I also love that there is a huge selection for the lunch special, think 12 dishes to choose from for appetizers and another 12 for entrées, and a small dessert as well for under $30.There's a wide selection of fish in keeping with the Greek theme, and certain things on the menu definitely brought me back to a recent trip to Greece.My lunch companion and I both ordered the fish of the day, which was a white fish that was thoughtfully prepared. It was well cooked, and we both enjoyed it. I got the octopus appetizer, which had a small supplement price, but was worth every penny. The grilled octopus was delicious and juicy, and the bed of onions it was served on was wonderful.I'm giving this three stars off because the service was flat-out rude. I hadn't finished my salad when they tried to plate my fish course. It was too small of a table, so they tried to take the salad away while I was mid-bite. There was still quite a bit on the plate. I thought about letting it go, but I instead told the waiter that I needed more time to finish my salad. He hovered over me while holding my entrée plate. It was super awkward for everybody, but I wasn't going to get bullied into not finishing the salad! It was really good!Anyway, after 30 seconds of hovering, I finished the salad and he plopped down my fish. Uncool!",0
"I was looking for a healthy brunch option and Bluebird didn't disappoint. The omelette was great, with a smooth texture and a delicious flavor. The fries were also great, with a crispy texture and a delicious flavor. The staff were all very friendly, and service did seem to be a little slow, but that didn't bother me. The place is super cute, and I would definitely like to go back and give it another shot.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, but unfortunately my experience was not at all positive. I was disappointed with the service, which was very slow and frustrating. The food was also quite mediocre - I didn't enjoy it at all. I would only recommend this place for drinks and the ambiance, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend it for food.",1
"I came here for a quick lunch and I was impressed! The line moved fast and the food is in a reusable microwaveable plastic container, so it's super convenient to take with you. I had butter chicken and spinach as my two sides and I thought the food was okay but it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. However, for the price (especially for lunch in this area) I would say it's definitely worth a try. I would definitely come back and try out some of the other sides.",1
I had a great experience ordering lunch from COVID during their lunch special. I ordered the La Style Galbi Lunch Box with kimchi fried rice and the Bulgogi Lunch Box with white rice. Both boxes were perfectly cooked and the kimchi was a standout. I would definitely recommend visiting in person to try their food!,1
"Da Gennaro is a great restaurant with delicious steak options. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and the Gorgonzola added a delicious richness to the dish. The polenta fries were also delicious and crispy. The only downside was that the bread was a bit tough to chew. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend Da Gennaro to others.",1
I came here before for a wine and cheese/chocolate tasting for a vendor event and I've wanted to come back ever since. So when friend and I were looking for a place for a glass of wine and a light bite I suggested this place. The wines recommended were excellent but we did experience a problem with our cheese plate order not coming out for 30 mins. Our bartender seemed to have forgotten to put in our order... I don't think we normally would have minded but we were feeling a bit peckish so we noticed the time more so than normal. My friend went to the restroom and had to wait 10 mins for her wine to be poured as well. Everything was excellent when it came out though so I will rate 4 stars despite the service.,0
"We had a great time at this restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was great. We ordered in family style so that everyone could choose what they wanted, and everyone loved it! We'll definitely be back!",1
"Overall, I thought the food was decent. The beef noodle soup was definitely a standout, with a great flavor and a thick, hearty texture. The mixed seafood noodles were also very good, with a variety of seafood flavors and textures. However, I found the stir-fry pea sprouts to be a bit average - they were good but not outstanding. Overall, I would say that this is a good option for a quick meal, especially if you're in the area and don't have much time to spend in a restaurant.",1
"Overall, I thought the food and drinks were average at Attaboy. The only thing that really stood out to me was the fan installation that blows hot air all over the place, which can be a bit of a annoyance depending on where you sit.",1
"We had a great experience at this restaurant! The food was excellent - both the main dishes and the small dishes. The dan dan noodles were our favorite, but we thought the spice level was a little mild. The spicy pork dumplings were also a great choice - definitely more of a kick, but still very mild. Delivery was very fast, and the food was fresh. We would definitely recommend this restaurant!",1
"Quick Stop! Ive been wanting to try Sticky's for years, and i finally got my hands on them. Honestly, i rate this place a 4 because i've had better but, their not bad. The chicken goes just right with the sauces. Tasty! The day i went their wasnt a line so i can only speak from my experience. I also, did notice that while i was looking at the menu a couple people came in and they were served pretty quickly. As theirs many other locations this one is pretty small but has a couple dine in seats and a couple of tables to munch on your meal. I had got chicken tenders and fries. The tenders were crispy and soft on the inside.  Again, they were deliciously tasty with the sauce. The fries were banging as well nice and crispy but enjoyable, the only thing i can complain about was that they were a little heavy handed on the salt. If it wasn't for that they would've been perfect. The sauces i got were Waffle sauce & Sassy Bbq. Ughhhh!!! Tasty!!!! Let me tell you guys something- now that im writing this and actually thinking about it i would rate this place a 4 1/2. If you loveeeee chicken and waffles this is the place you gotta go give a try. Just try it and let me know if im right. Epiccccc is what i call it. Immensely intelligent is what i call it. The combination of the chicken tenders and waffle sauce is immaculate. Overall, if i wanted the taste of chicken and waffles i would definitely go back to Sticky's.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at this restaurant! The service was attentive and the food was great! I ordered the clams with black bean sauce, salt and pepper squid and chicken chow fun. The clams were very nice, the sauce especially was great to just pour over rice. The chicken and noodles in the chow fun were great, not super oily but enough to warm the heart. The squid was above average, not dry which can occasionally happen which ruins it. I would definitely come back here!",1
"It's a mid-tier sushi omakase place. Fish selection is decent, but portion sizes are small. There's not much fish per bite, and there is probably a bit too much rice for the fish size. As for the rice, it's on the stickier side, and is not as sour or sweet, if that's your thing; very standard sushi rice. Some of the torched pieces I thought were over cooked, and the raw fish in general were just okay, nothing too mind-blowing.Chefs here are pretty busy, and I think since they just opened, it's pretty strict. This can translate over to the customers, who feel less willing to ask questions or interact with the chefs.I don't know if there's much that differentiates Matsunori from other $60-range omakases in the city, like Bou or M.",0
"4 stars from my guy3 stars from meAre here on a Saturday around 5, just before the dinner crowd. Be sure to make reservations, as it gets busy.I had the salmon with cream sauce and added mushrooms. The salmon was plentiful, pasta cooked appropriately. However, it's all about the sauce and I thought theirs was on the bland side. Nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't cure. He had the penne and meatballs. He LOVED it. Said that their tomato sauce was authentic Italian and fantastic. His pasta was cooked perfectly. I liked his dish better than mine.They have complimentary bread, which was right on time when I arrived because I was starving and it was perfection. Simple, but freshly baked. We'll be back because he loves it. For me, tolerable.",0
This German restaurant was in a Bavarian pub like setting. This would be a good place for a big group since their tables are really long. This is my first time trying German food. The sausage was flavorful and it went well with the veggies served along with it. Their brussels sprouts was a little too burnt. I think most of their food is a little bland for my liking. Service was pretty slow. We were seated but we waited awhile before someone came over to take our order. Food took long to come out as well.,0
"I was delighted to find a real-deal Texas BBQ spot right in the middle of Manhattan. Even as a vegetarian, even seeing this spot from the street made me homesick, so we had to check it out while in the neighborhood on a recent Monday afternoon. After taking a seat on their spacious patio, we ordered a couple frozen margaritas and an order of chips, salsa, and queso. While the service was a bit slow, the margaritas really hit the spot, and the snacks, particularly the queso, were authentic. Besides the food, the interior was gorgeous and quintessentially central Texas, including the music venue downstairs that rivals anything I have seen in Austin. I would love to come back and sample their Tex-Mex brunch and, of course, more margs.",1
"Viand is a great brunch spot! The service was great and kept our coffee full, which is all I ask for when I'm eating brunch outside. The corned beef hash is highly recommended. The sandwich was okay, I didn't really care for the bread. We enjoyed our breakfast here and would recommend it.",1
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The chicken was nothing but flavored oil, and the sweet potatoes fires were really good. The waiter was ok, but he never came back to take my food order. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"They're consistently mediocre with all options. It's a diner and convenient at times for their delivery in which they deliver earlier than most and the food is mutually consistent. I've tried all things like the grilled cheese, eggs, omelettes, pancakes, French toast, BLT etc. Nothing fancy, but solid diner food.",0
"I was very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The hostess stand was unprofessional and the wait was incredibly long. The food was mediocre at best and the waiter was very busy catering to the table of six young girls next to us. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I came to this restaurant for brunch with a group of friends yesterday and we were all really pleased with the food. Our waitress recommended the Mezze Collection and 2 Meat Supremes, and we were not disappointed. The labneh was a great starter, with a delicate sweetness that didn't overpower the taste of the herbs. The muhammara was also delicious, with a rich, complex flavor that was perfect for dipping bread into. The meat supremes were also a big hit, with a variety of flavors and textures that were all delicious. I especially loved the chicken and beef, which were both cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious brunch experience.",1
"The atmosphere is really relaxing and the food is just okay. The cappuccino was $4.50 and I wasn't really that satisfied with it. My friend ordered the egg n apples Benedict and it was really good. The taste of the food is average, but the presentation is really cool. Overall, I would say this place is okay, but I wouldn't come back.",1
"This spot is always reliable when it comes to food and drinks. Recently, I visited during happy hour and was impressed with the selection of appetizers. My favorite was the Plato Loco, which was just a sampler of different items but all of them were very tasty. My friend tried the dirty martini and said it was the strongest yet. The decor on the second floor is great for a night out with friends, but I wish they did happy hour on the first floor as well. Otherwise, this place is always a hit.",1
"It's a cute restaurant that look kinda small but actually have a few tables and seats. Friendly servers and decent speed. Definitely a few tables when I was there but wasn't crowded, I got my food pretty fast and it look simple but definitely homemade. Tastes good, lighter on the stomach it's not like those chain restaurants or those really big restaurants in Times Square with heavy pasta. It tastes more like home and a bit like country side for me. Nice texture and cute plates, especially the ones on the wall for decorations. Clean place and not too hard to find. Walkable to subway stations. I'd go back and I do recommend people to check it out! It's not a place I'd frequent but it's a place I'd go back once in a while for sure. I wouldn't mind bringing family or friends along too",0
This is for delivery only. I ordered the 5 Napkin Burger and added avocado. I was curious why it didn't come with any sides until it arrived lol. This burger is massive! It was delicious! The gruyere cheese was melted. The caramelized onions were cooked nicely. The avocado could have been more fresh. I ordered the burger medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! The rosemary garlic aioli sauce was sooo yummy! I just wish there was more of it! Haha. The bottom of the bun in the container got soggy on the way over here. Still it was delicious. Definitely needed at least five napkins for face and hands! I'd order from here again. No sides needed with this burger! Very filling. Order was quick and correct.,0
Deceitful. They have the option of adding more tip at the end and the way they do it is super shady. They don't tell you gratuity is already included (20%) and other customers have experienced this too. Will be contesting this with my bank. I contacted the manager through their website (submitted a form). You can't find the phone number anywhere on their sites. It was a very bad experience and I will not be supporting this business again. I feel like they may have gotten away with it many times.,0
"Detroit style pizzeria. We shared an order of pepperoni. Their regular orders cost on the Oder of $10-15 depending on the specialty slice and the order equates to two regular sized grandma or Sicilian slices, so it's a bit pricey and you have to get what equates to two slices. I was hoping for crispier pepperonis. I really like the crispy curled in pepperonis from prince street pizza. Service was quick and they have a couple of outdoor tables.",0
"Bao by Kaya is one of my favorite Broadway Bites popups. The duck bao is my favorite, 2nd fave pork belly. The popcorn chicken with spicy mayo (basically karaage) is the perfect accompaniment. My husband just wants the duck bao so I buy 6 individual baos for him. What really makes the duck bao is the hoisin sauce.Broadway Bites tends to run out of duck by the end of the day, so I usually pick it up at lunchtime to take home for dinner. The bao hold up really well and don't get soggy.Never been to the actual location, but Bao regularly appears at Broadway Bites, conveniently located near work.",0
"Laut Singapura may be a popular Singaporean restaurant, but I didn't think it was particularly great. The music was from the 2000s and it felt like the waiters were trying to get us to order more (even though we had a party of nine). The food was ok, but nothing special. I would recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for something special.",1
"I was really excited to try Nino's 46 based on the great reviews, but my experience was not great. The food fell flat and the service was mediocre. I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"I love burgers and this has consistently been one of my favorite burger spots. The place is decorated in a really cute retro style. I always like to check out a restaurant's bathroom and this one doesn't disappoint, I especially like all of the Jet magazine covers used to decorate. My go to order here is actually from the kid's menu, it comes with a mini burger, fries and a drink. For me the kid's meal is the perfect size, I really love the fries here. Even though I'm not a dairy person I usually order the black and white milkshake from here. I've been coming here for a while and at one point it seemed that the milkshakes changed and it was not for the better so I started to avoid the shakes. If you're into burgers then this is a great place to check out.",0
"I called for a delivery at around 3 PM on a Saturday. The lady on the phone spoke extremely low and appeared lost; every time I asked a question she had to put me on hold to ask someone else. I am actually glad that they told me that deliveries start at 5 PM. I am almost certain that my order would of came incorrectly.

I called back at a later time, and got someone else on the phone. The man I spoke to was able to answer my questions and place the order exactly how I wanted. The pizza was delivered fast and it satisfied my craving for THIS type of pizza. I would definitely order from them again.",1
"We visited BG Restaurant for brunch.  We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately upon arriving.  Service was great.The food was solid but not spectacular.  The avocado toast was relatively bland and missing some of the touches that make the dish shine (like feta, a lemony kick, or red pepper flakes).  The portion was quite small, too.  The croque madame, on the other hand, was quite good--though some were too mustardy.  And the latte and cappuccino were both perfectly prepared.The seating area is what really makes this place stand out.  You have terrific views of the surrounding buildings and into Central Park, and the mirrors on the wall make sure that every seat gets to enjoy the views.  Definitely a great (but not cheap) brunch spot for anyone looking to dine in the neighborhood!",0
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The staff were very accommodating and the food was delicious. I wish there was more heater inside, but overall I had a great time. The fried rice clay pot was a bit salty, but overall I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"Ordered a sandwich from here the other day. It was hard to decide which to get because all the options sound amazing! I decided to get the godmother. It came with breaded chicken, mozzarella, arugula, roasted red peppers and balsamic glaze. For sure tasty and such a large sandwich!! Big enough for 3 servings for me.",0
"Overall, the restaurant was okay. The service was slow, but the staff was friendly. The food was okay - the shrimp in the arroz con camarones was overcooked, and the price could have been better. The appitizers were good, though.",1
"I came back from Tokyo with a serious appreciation for Japanese curry, and reckoned the best of the bunch near me would be out in K-Town.Abiko has a reputation for offering up the spiciest Japanese curry in NYC, and I really wanted to like the offerings. Unfortunately, it came up short.I walked in for lunch on a blustery afternoon and got seated fairly quick. The menu offers up hashed beef, curry rice, noodles, and more in a few styles (pork, veggie, beef, et al) and at 5 spice levels: mild, medium, spicy, extra spicy, and ""spice guru"". I went with pork curry over rice at extra spicy and a side of natto. The waiter tried a few times to warn me against the spice but took the order.The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but...it just can't compare to CoCo Curry or other spots in Japan. The curry here was too watery and despite the warnings, didn't pack as much heat as promised (though it was well seasoned otherwise). At $13 for the curry, it was a few dollars pricier than expected, and the order of natto never came.It might be worth another visit to see if ""spice guru"" really lives up to the hype; otherwise, the hunt for great Japanese curry in New York continues",0
"The hot & crispy baby back ribs were amazing! I definitely recommend them. The banchan was also really good, we asked for seconds. However, the stone bowl was a bit bland for my taste.",1
"Cool spot....but, ima have to revisit to try this burger of which they speak because I knew nothing about it this stop in. We were walking past and stopped for a drink. I had more that the one I thought I went for but, welcome to my world. The restaurant is dark as chit. We sat at the bar and glanced around wondering how diners were able to read the menus AND eat. I was having issues myself at the better lit (but not by much) bar and had to turn my phone's flashlight on. Oh the shame.  What is it with restaurants and these staircases!?! This one had a winding contraption. You know the type, as if you're ascending into the head of lady liberty. Man this city ain't vertigo friendly at all at all.However, when you finally make it upstairs. There's a lounge area just outside the loo and folks were sitting around chatting. Let me tell you, I tried to pee as quietly and gently as I could because I didn't want my splash being the soundtrack to these folks' conversation. NO SIR!I came out and almost washed my hands between these kind folks conversation seeing the sinks were almost in the middle of the lounge chairs. The set up is different. Upstairs has an artsy feel to it. Very nicely eclectically decorated. I like Raoul's Restaurant, even if I didn't get to try their darn burger. **Kicking myself** The End.",0
"Electric Lemon is a popular rooftop restaurant in the Equinox Hotel in New Jersey. The high ceilings and expansive views make it a great place to eat, but I suspect that the restaurant is even better at night when the cityscape is lit up by the lights of Manhattan. The bahn mi I had was tasty, with a sturdy bread and flavorful carrots. The prices are high, but it's worth it to dine in an atmosphere that is both modern and prestigious.",1
"Came here on a Friday at 10:30am for breakfast with a friend. There was no wait and the place was semi-empty! The interior of Jack's has a clean diner aesthetic. This place is very cute and definitely instagrammable if thats what you're into! (Like their menus have cute little doodles on them)I ordered the Green Shakshuka - theres 2 eggs baked in green tomatillo and served with two slices of toasted brioche. I ordered this because it was unique! When it came, the bright green shakshuka really caught my eye. Flavor was good and I especially loved how soft the bioche was. However, because the brioche was so soft, I had a hard time eating it with the shakshuka as it couldn't really hold much of the sauce/egg on it without falling. Service was great and food came in a good time - my water cup was always filled and waiters checked in periodically to make sure everything was going good. I would recommend if you wanted to try something unique such as a green shakshuka!",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was really good and the prices were reasonable. I was a little disappointed with the service, though. I thought it was a bit unreasonable that they charged a $25 service fee just to cut the cake and bring it out. But overall, I had a great time!",1
"Drinks were great! Chips and dip also great!Silverware and plates dirty.Server never introduced herself, and just assumed we were ready for the check.. never asked us if we were ready. Bill came up to $41 and change for 2 drinks and chips & dip. Inclusive of tax and 18%tip.I don't like when restaurants do this. They essentially are forcing what you should give as a tip. Good overall was good customer service eh. Needs work.",0
"I wanted to really love this restaurant, but unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. The decor is really cute, and the food looked promising on the menu, but unfortunately it just wasn't that great. Our group of vegetarians had better Ethiopian food at another place, and the flavors weren't that amazing. Our server was also pretty rude, which didn't help. The cocktails were good though. I probably won't be back, and I'd recommend sticking with places like Bunna Cafe instead.",1
"I visited this restaurant for lunch on a weekday and was really pleased with the pre-fixe special. The tom yum soup was excellent, and the taro rolls were also very good - a nice, light bite. Sadly, the penang curry wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped, but still edible. I would give this restaurant 3.5 stars.",1
"Kings Co Imperial is a great restaurant that I would definitely recommend. The food was all delicious and the servers and bartender were all really nice. The Dan Dan Mian noodles had a wonderful flavor and were the perfect level of spice. The dumplings were actually much larger portion sized than I expected so that was nice. It was a tad pricey, especially with Chinatown not far away, but I'll still likely come back sometime.",1
"Considering how hard it is to find a good and cheap Malaysian restaurant, I would give this place 5 stars.I was rarely disappointed when visiting this restaurant. Really loved their Young Tau foo,  Mi Goreng, and beef rengdang. I also usually ordered Haianese chicken rice to go from here.The chicken noodles weren't that good though. Too bland.Every rice/noodles dish was usually under $10, so it was definitely affordable.CASH ONLY.",0
"The Tri Tip Grill sandwich was a delicious and filling meal that made up for the poor customer service experience. The beef was tender and tasty with a good amount of flavor, and the BBQ sauce added a nice touch. The side I ordered (fries and water) were unfortunately forgotten, but the sandwich was so good that I didn't really miss them. Overall, a great sandwich experience and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"I had a really great time at Emmy's Squared! The pizza was really tasty and authentic - not as gourmet-oriented as some of the other restaurants in the area, but I liked it better that way. The vodka and mushroom pie were both great - the vodka was a bit more intense in flavor, but the mushroom was really delicious. The crust was also really crispy, which I loved. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant - 313-worthy all the way!",1
"I had a great time at Anand! The atmosphere was really quiet, but not at all stifling, which was perfect for conversations. The food was really tasty, and the portions were pretty generous. I would definitely recommend Anand to anyone looking for a tasty, reasonably priced meal!",1
"Mushroom pie was delicious! I Highly recommend. It tasted like garlic knots in the shape of a pizza with cheese and mushrooms on top. Mushrooms were big juicy and chunky so that was great. Mustard pie- interesting. I enjoyed it since I like mustard. The taste can get a bit tiring though so the fact that they give you a vodka sauce for dipping is awesome. It helps change up your taste buds. Even though theres some ham In side the slice, I felt like I needed some more toppings on the top to bite into. I think that would make it better.The guy at the counter was super friendly and personable. All the customers had fun talking to him. He made the atmosphere enjoyable. Overall, I would definitely drop in for some pizza, and if I was around the area, I'd come back to try other slices.",0
"Jacob's Pickles has quite the covid outdoor seating set up - they basically own this whole block which enables them to keep a very safe distance between the tables which I really appreciated. We came here with friends on a Friday for lunch. We had made a reservation, but there were still many open tables. We were running about 30 minutes late but had called and they were very accommodating to us and held the table. Our friends had just gotten married that morning so when the staff learned, they sent over champagne for the couple which was very sweet! I had the Bloody BLT to drink, having read it was one of the best in the city. It was good, but lacked that spicy kick I was hoping for. To eat I had the hot chicken biscuit which was so amazing. And so so big!! There is like a whole jar of pickles on top of two big pieces of chicken and a large biscuit. I ate half of it and was stuffed. We also shared the selection of pickles as an app which are always great. The staff was attentive and kind. I would come again and eat outside, but I have noted it does get really packed on the weekend and evenings with people standing around the tables.",0
"I'm so happy I discovered Hunan Delight! They have an amazing selection of vegan/vegetarian options that include stir-fries, noodle dishes and mock meats. I've tried the kung-pao ""chicken"" and sesame ""beef"" and both were amazing. The scallion pancakes, veggie dumplings and chow fun noodles are also great. It's really rare to find a Chinese restaurant that has vegetarian options that aren't just tofu, so Hunan Delight is really special and definitely one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. The only thing they could improve is if they added vegetarian and vegan tags to their Seamless page. I would have found them so much sooner if they came up when I was searching for restaurants that had those options!",1
"Overall, I was underwhelmed by my experience at this restaurant. The food was bland and I didn't enjoy it at all. The service was also mediocre, especially considering the high ratings it seems to have. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Came at 11 30 on a Sunday and although the line looked long it went by fairly quickly and we got a seat for 2 after 20ish minutes. I got the green shakshuka and it came out fairly quickly. This is only the second time in my life I've had shakshuka so I'm not an expert by any means, but it was kind of a miss for me. The sauce just tasted too.....fresh? Like the herbs weren't well incorporated with the dish and there weren't enough spices. Also wasn't a huge fan of getting regular bread instead of pita. It's a cute spot but I probably won't be back.",0
"Hanoi House is a decent restaurant with tasty food and small portions. The only downside is the loud atmosphere, which made it difficult to have a conversation with our dining companion.",1
"I had a great time at GLUR Thai! The flavor was great in my pad see ew. A hint of spicy not overwhelming and piping hot (temperature). Jeeb (dumpling) was great in flavor w the dipping sauce. The thai tea is sad. Not great, quite watery and not enough milk i think(idk tho im not a pro). However, the seafood in my pad see ew was also sad, not fresh tasted from frozen and squid was rubbery :( I like their chopsticks are real. Plus the service is so amazing and attentive. And the coconut pudding (khanom tuay) was awesome w taro paste underneath and so warm. (Thats why I gave it a 4/5 hope i dont sound annoying)",1
"Reese Witherspoon's restaurant is a great place to go for a southern meal. The biscuits were delicious, and the Mac and cheese was also good. The lemonade is the best part of the restaurant, though- it's refreshing and delicious. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Reese Witherspoon's restaurant.",1
"I had a great time eating at this restaurant. The decor is really cool, and the staff was super friendly. The only downside is that the food wasn't as good as it could have been. The Pad Thai was really good, but the chicken portions were a bit small. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Thai meal.",1
"This restaurant is always a good choice for any type of meal. The service was excellent, and the waitstaff was very attentive. I would definitely recommend this establishment to any friends or family looking for a delicious, unique meal. The garlic naan was also a favorite of mine - they're not as common here in the states, so it was a nice surprise. The Konkani fish curry was absolutely stunning, and very well spiced. I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"The Buffalo chicken pizza at this restaurant is not bad at all. It's a little oily, but the flavor is really good. The crust is crispy and the bottom is crispy, too. I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Unfortunately, having a pizzeria in NYC one is automatically held to very high standards especially if you are someone like myself that is from Los Angeles and everyone says the pizza options in LA are trash, but I beg to differ. The pizza was great. I got a slice of mushrooms and honey hot (I never snap photos of my food but, I was very excited). I was satisfied but, I was not blown away. In fact, there are restaurants back home that I would prefer over this spot, but needless to say I would still return and try other slices. Staff is very nice especially the owner/manager. It can get busy but everything moves along fast. Slices may look pricey but they are rather large slices.",0
"I'm glad I decided to give Angkor a try again - the food is still great and the atmosphere is just as inviting as ever. I especially loved the fish cakes, which were cooked to perfection and had a delicious lemongrass flavor. The only downside is that the mussels were a bit salty for my taste, but overall I was really happy with my meal. The roast duck was also a hit, and would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something a bit more substantial. All in all, Angkor is a great restaurant with great food and fantastic service. I can't wait to come back!",1
"The milkshake at this restaurant was terrible. It was just some milk, syrup, and cookie dough bits - you could make a better milkshake at home by just adding a bit of milk to ice cream and sticking it in a blender. The staff were also really rude - they seemed unhappy to serve anyone that wasn't a regular. And the place itself is really old - it's been there since before the Great Depression and it just looks like they're a window into the past, but in a bad way. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
This place is amazing! I recently went to their restaurant week event and it was so worth it. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was amazing. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes.,1
"I stopped by American Gelato for a quick gelato before work and I was really impressed! The line moves quickly, so I was able to get my gelato in no time. I ordered a medium cone with rose flavor and it was delicious! They have a really great variety of flavors and I'm definitely going to be back to try more. The only downside is that the cones are a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it!",1
"I stopped by this restaurant for a quick pizza craving and I was really impressed! The crust was perfectly thin and not too greasy, and the atmosphere was clean and well-kept. They also have a variety of seasonings and sauces available to top your pizza yourself, which I found to be a nice touch. I'll definitely be back!",1
"Delicious ribs! But unfortunately not as fresh as their other location in East Village. I believe they get their meats from another location since they don't have a wood fired bbq cooker here. Nevertheless this is one of my favorite food options in Brookfield. You order meat here as a single order or by the pound. I usually get a half rack of ribs accompanied with an assortment of sides. Some sides that I like: mashed sweet potatoes, mac n cheese and broccoli w/ bacon. The ribs here are fall of the bone tender and super flavorful. You can ask for hot sauce on the side to spice things up. They also have take-out ready containers of extra sauce near the utensils and napkins. I really enjoy this place but if you like it be sure to visit their main location in East Village where all the cooking is done!",0
"Cozy & casual JapaneseStumbled upon this place as I work in the area and was looking for a new place to eat. There is a counter buffet where you pick out your food. I filled a plate full of some of their hot dishes. Priced well & tasty. There was a cold food area & pre-packaged meals as well, but didn't try any of that. I would definitely stop by again to try out more.",0
"The restaurant was very busy, and our server, Shon, was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the sticky chicken fingers and yellow rice, and the rice was delicious without any added flavors. My friends who ordered appetizers or salad got their food first, but I was happy with my food. The only downside was the check situation: we all had so many things on the order and one check, so we had to break it up so many ways to pay. I would definitely visit this restaurant again soon.",1
"I really love Artichoke. I really do.And I was so excited that through grubhub they deliver at home! Ordered few slices and guess what.- Order was placed around 9.15PM. - Order was confirmed and said that it will take 1h to be delivered (fine. It is just slices and we all know that Artichoke has them ready at the counter but be it)- 1h and 15 min later no news about the delivery. It is still not delivered.- Called grubhub support, they say that order is ready to be sent. Apologies.- 15min later, order still not sent. And estimated delivery is updated to 10.59PM-11.09PM!!!!! This is more than 1.5h from my order.- Got a call for the delivery man, that he is leaving and sorry for the delay.- it took more than 30 min to get here. And I really felt sorry for the delivery man who came all the way here with his bike- Pizza delivered 2h later and slices were of course, COLD.Yes, it is my fault because I've should stayed local and I would have gotten my pizza in no time and fresh from the oven.I took the risk because I really like Artichoke. They crab pizza is just simply amazing.Here is my complaint: either Artichoke or Grubhub. You should not commit to this service if you know that you are not going to meet the min standards. You are not able to deliver in the UES. Don't take this business because it will just affect negatively to your business. It is DECEIVING.What is the point of delivering a cold pizza 2h later?",0
"Decent neighborhood spot for ramen. The main vegetarian ramen option is the ""veggie veggie ramen"" which comes topped with tasty tofu skins. The second time I went, there was a seasonal ""spicy creamy veggie ramen"" which was pretty good although it could have been spicier and it could have been creamier. It unfortunately does not come with the tofu skins, though it does come with arugula, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and corn. The spicy edamame are tasty but covered in butter/oil to the point that I had to wash my hands afterward. The vegetarian gyoza are good but not worth getting again. Overall, I really don't have any complaints about the food/ambience/service at Mei Jin, but it just isn't the to-die-for ramen experience I'm looking for.",0
"I had a really enjoyable experience at Malai Marke restaurant. The service was very dignified and I felt like I was being treated well. The food was delicious, and the prices for the items were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I was disappointed with my experience at Madame Vo BBQ. The nem nuong were good, but the bo lui and short rib spring roll were both lackluster. The banh hoi platter was a waste of money, as it only included a small serving of rice paper rolls, lettuce, vermicelli noodles, mint, pineapple, and a medley of apple and carrot slices. The service was friendly and efficient, but the ambience was too cool for my taste. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Was not impressed at all! Got guacamole for the table and was asked if we wanted it spicy or not. We asked for it to be spicy but it was the blandest guacamole ever! We asked for extra jalapeños and got a little cup of chopped up jalapeños, but it still wasn't enough. There was no flavor to the guacamole. The fried fish tacos were not bad and the sauce on that actually had more spices to it, but without good guacamole it's not worth a try.",0
"Chinatown was a bit hectic that day road barricaded every where it was hard to navigate or park, we walked to this location from a few blocks away. It was a busy store front we ordered three rice crepes: curry fish balls, shrimps and pork, it was soft even after sometime had passed when we had a chance to eat it. The staff was friendly but expect a wait as it was prepared and steamed to order! The sauce was good with it!",0
"I stopped by this restaurant while in NYC for the weekend and was really pleased with the experience! The hak rolls (which are basically sushi rolls with hakauroi (fish balls) inside) were very filling and the hak dumplings (a type of dumpling filled with pork or shrimp) were also very filling. The filling was different than what I'm used to, but it was definitely a good choice and very tasty. The restaurant was small but cute and the service was great. It's a bit of a walk from the city center, but definitely worth it if you're looking for a quick on the go meal.",1
"We love Hakkasan. We've been to the one in SF and hosted a large party there so we thought we would give the NYC location a try. A big shout out to Amanda Feng and Danny for helping us create a birthday dinner for 19 people, possible (even though I contacted her 1 day before the dinner). We arrived and walked to a nice private section. They even had a table for presents. They labeled the pre-set menu for my brother's birthday. We ordered the following:Small EatsHakka steamed dim sum platter - good variety & guests enjoyed it (I was saving my stomach for the Peking duck)Salt and pepper squid - Delicious Peking Duck - My favorite dish of the evening. Totally worth ordering. I'm still craving this dish today!!MainSanpei chicken clay pot - DeliciousGrilled Chilean sea bass - my brother's favorite dish (besides the Peking duck)Sweet and sour pork tenderloin - Really good Spicy prawns - Guests loved it. Stir-fry sugar snaps, cloud ear and water chestnuts - Loved this dish Spring onion and egg fried rice - Delicious (ate 1.5 bowls)Dessert Chef's selection (egg custard in a beautiful nest - good and sorbet, flan or coconut with pieces of chocolate - too full to try it but looked amazing)We also ordered for the kids: chicken fried rice (so good that I ate some. My daughter doesn't eat rice and she liked it), potstickers and crab egg drop soup We also ordered really nice Sake - thanks to the sommelier onsite. We had an organic sake (my kind of sake). Our servers was exceptional. I forgot their names. Overall, the service was amazing, food was exceptional and the evening was perfect. My brother had to unbutton his shirt bc he was so full! I was so full too but couldn't stop eating.",0
"Overall, I had a decent experience at this Chinese spot. The soup dumplings were my favorite part - they were really delicious. The service was fine and the atmosphere was intimate, so it's definitely a place that's good for a romantic night out. However, I wasn't too thrilled with the wontons in chili oil. They were definitely spicy, but not in a good way - they were too spicy for my taste and made my mouth feel dry. Additionally, the powdered sugar on the meat was a bit strange - I was expecting it to be more like a soy sauce or dipping sauce, but it was just a bit of sugar on top of the meat. Overall, I'd recommend the xiaolongbao over the wontons, but I wouldn't order the sweet rib (it was dry and not very tasty).",1
"Pretty good slice shop for FiDi. They have a mix of regular and square pizzas. Tried the hot honey and the buffalo chicken. The square slice was thicker with a nice crisp and chewy dough. Maybe a bit heavy on the honey and ideally I would've liked more pepperoni. The buffalo chicken regular slice is thin but not as crisp as some other NYC places.Around $5 per slice, it's not bad at all and definitely better quality than many places in the area. They also have a bathroom open to customers.",0
"I work right around the block and was looking for a new place to try. This place is very clean but the food was gross. Lamb was flavorless and tasted like armpit. The ""naan""? Was 2 cold pieces of pita bread. I also left hungry. Total was around $10. No thanks, too many other awesome options in this area and I can go to a street cart and pay $5 for incredible lamb",0
"I had a really great experience at The Expat! I ordered the fried chicken sando and the chicken and mochi waffle, and they were both really delicious. I also really loved their tater tots - they were perfectly crispy. Overall, I highly recommend stopping by or ordering some takeout - their food is delicious!",1
"We made reservation on a Sunday afternoon and the place was absolutely packed. Ordered the grapefruit and orange juice which was really expensive, almost $10?! Chips and guacamole with crab - actual crab! This was goodLoaded tots with bacon - surprisingly good even though the tots were made from chickpea and not potatoesBeef short rib - this was fine, nothing to really write about. Eggs, salmon, and cream cheese - interesting taste with the cream cheese. it wasn't really mixed cleanly into the egg, it was more like lumps. I liked that the entrees were a bit different than your normal brunch offerings for variety especially the appetizers.",0
"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The food took forever to come, and I didn't particularly enjoy my dish. My friend had orders a wine and was almost done with it by the time the food came, which was a bit of a buzzkill. The dish she got, the frittata, was also not very good. The first bite I was like ""yeah pretty good"", but as I got more into it, I actually started feeling a little sick of it. My friend got the poached eggs, which she didn't like as much either mostly because there were eggshells in it. Ha. For something like $18/dish you would expect a bit more. Overall, I don't think I would come back.",1
"I recently visited Raku and had a fantastic experience! The hot udon noodles were incredibly soft and chewy with just the right amount of flavor - it was a great meal overall. I also recommend ordering the sansai - it comes with a poached egg and mochi which is a must for any mochi lover! The wait time during busy times can be a bit long, but it's definitely worth it!",1
I came to this restaurant for brunch and I loved it! I got the shashouka  and it was delicious. I also got the Mykonos Mule which I liked. The ambience and the vibe of the place were really great. I would definitely come back.,1
"I noticed this taking over this particular location a while back and wondered about it but not much since this place had been home to many a failed site, the last an Indian food place. But one day I decided to come in and try the cuisine.Planta is an international affair with locations in Canada and a smattering of places in the US, mostly Florida. Keeping that in mind I wouldn't assume anything, however there is a reason why they're expanding and made it to the NYC market. They know how to make vegan food flavorful and delicious. Planta Queen itself is the Asian fusion type of version of vegan food and it doesn't disappoint. They do an amazing job of truffling up things (udon and dumplings are both fire) and their other offerings are decent too.The only downside is NYC prices for your food. You're going to spend more than 50 if you eat here with appetizer drink and main in mind. But this seems to be the trend. Trendy food and good food costs you in this concrete jungle. I'm willing to splurge on this place.They're opening a Planta downtown in soho which will do Mexican type food soon.",0
"I really enjoyed the food here at Pinch Chinese. The roast duck was delicious and definitely worth the price, but I thought the xiao long bao (XLB) was even better. The jajang noodles were also really good. The restaurant's vibe was really cool, with interesting murals on the walls and cool music playing. It felt like a fun upscale Chinese restaurant, which are sometimes hard to come by. All in all, I thought it was a great place to eat.",1
"Shanghai Asian Cuisine serves solid food with reasonable prices! The vegetarian mock duck was great; I really enjoyed the smoothness/slight stretchiness of the mock duck with the chewy mushrooms, and the mushrooms were really flavorful and not mushroom-y in the typical way (which is high praise coming from someone who doesn't love mushrooms). As it's a cold dish, it came within a minute of ordering and was super refreshing!The xiao long bao were also really good today. The dumpling wrapper is as thin as can be, the soup inside is clear, and the meat isn't fatty, making for pretty light (but tasty!) bites.I dined at Shanghai Asian Cuisine last winter and was disappointed to find the meat in the xiao long bao a bit dry. There is perhaps a bit of inconsistency in the dumplings here, as some of the xiao long bao today were juicier than others. However, the staff were really nice, and I would recommend stopping by if you're in the area!",0
"Expectations were high, as they should be. The food was good, as expected, but that's about it. Service wasn't incredible, prices were steep, drinks were okay... but the whole thing was not really worth the hype. This is a commercial spot - and that's that. I am glad we did it, but probably would offer other recommendations before this spot. Absolutely nothing against Marcus Samuelsson and the success, just not my kinda place...",0
"Beatnic is a great restaurant for healthy options! The salads didn't look boring and they had air fried potato/sweet potato fries which were delicious. The food was prompt and the desserts were a bit undercooked, but overall a great experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"The Sky Room rooftop bar was pretty standard overall. I understand that rooftop bars are often critiqued more harshly than other bars, but I thought the views were pretty average. The cost was higher than lower-level bars, but that's to be expected. The food we ordered was pretty meh, and we didn't enjoy it at all. Overall, it wasn't too bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",1
"I ordered the lobster bisque and the junior NY sirloin.The bisque was good. It was creamy. However it didn't have that much lobster and it also lacked a certain unctuous egginess I prefer a bisque to bring.The steak had an impressive char and the portion was ridiculously large for a ""junior"" steak. The steak was perfectly tender and had nice fat marbling throughout. The accompanying green beans and potatoes were unimpressive and undercooked.",0
"I had a decent experience at Orion diner, even though I had a bad experience a few years ago. The food was pretty good and the service was friendly. My daughter got some soup and realized with wasnt enough food so she also ordered a big bowl of grits. The grits came pretty quick considering it was a late add-on. I will say the grits were pretty bland and tasteless but atleast she had a full belly. I will say at this point Orion diner has earned another visit from me to partake in their lunch menu in the future.",1
"I stopped in here today after seeing this place listed in Eater's top 40 cheap eats in the city. I ordered the Build Your Own Stirfry with spicy cumin lamb, ribbon noodles and extra spicy. The to go container was filled with lamb, noodles and cilantro; very spicy and flavorful. The lamb noodles and the pork fried dumplings (also good) are definitely pricey compared to other places like Xian Famous Foods, however you get a lot of food. The dish was plenty to share! Given Covid, make sure to bring water, napkins and wet wipes to eat outside the place on the counter.",0
"I thought the coffee was pretty average, but the bakery items were really good. I'd come back for some breakfast items, but I wouldn't order anything from Grubhub again.",1
"I ordered from this restaurant 2 weeks in a row, and I've only gotten the pleasure of trying a couple of things on the menu. So far I've had the double burger with vegan cheese, and the gluten-free bun, and the bacon burger with the gluten-free bun. I always insist on ordering the buffalo sauce inside even when I previously thought that it only made sense on chicken wings and I'm never disappointed. I can see myself in the future ordering the bison burger which I imagine would be just as delicious as their organic beef.I've been pleasantly surprised every time. Even though one of my orders came about 20 minutes late I've enjoyed every part of the meal including the fries which were cooked to perfection. There is a location close to my alma mater (Pace University) and I've only been there a couple of times but have regretted not visiting more often so I'm definitely trying to make up for those lost dining experiences.",0
"Wo-Hop is certainly a NYC institution that's why even when I visited Hollywood Cali I saw a few Wo-Hop tee shirts....So I have been coming here for over 20 years,after working the door at famous clubs and after all is said and done most of the staff and some patrons would gather here for an early morning meal....Walking downstairs and seeing all the dollor's on the wall and all the shirts and pictures and at 5am seeing women in all black and heels or boots dressed from the clubs an amazing site..Most times our table had 6-10 people and usually we ordered numerous items and shared because that was the norm.A little bit of this and a little bit of that.Chicken was always cooked well and so was the meats,the soups were refreshing and there was an all round great vibe there especially during the late early morning hours.The restaurant is staffed by older Chinese men and that made for one of Wo-Hop's many charms.I still go there and  reminisce about my cool club days here...Food is still good and the cool vibes are still here.....I even finally got a few Wo-Hop tee shirts....",0
"This place is just ok. It's expensive, it's Bourgeois, yet not upscale. Located on upper Eastside, which houses a lot of... Well, any way. Upon my arrival I was greeted by either the manager of the establishment or the owner. He was a older white male. Instead of greeting me with a simple hello, how can I help you, he asked me ""what do you have going on?""   can't make this shit up if I tried.  I was running late for the reservation. I had a business meeting with my coworker. Had I not been running late and not distracted by the fact that I was running late I would've challenged his question to me, Because who the hell greets guests like that?  I can guarantee you he would never have greeted any of those old folks that way. I was the only person of color in the entire establishment. So I knew I was in the wrong place.  The food is overpriced, and slightly bland. I ordered the skirt steak with the potatoes and the enchilada.The skirt steak was delicious , The blueberry tequila shots were very good as were the margaritas.I did not like the vibe of the establishment. I particularly did not appreciate how I was greeted.It's 2022 and Black people still have to deal with micro-aggressive behaviors such as the aforementioned.""What do you have going on?""  He's lucky I was there for business, because I would have read him in front of the entire establishment.If you're a person of color please be aware of this establishment, eat here at your own risk.",0
"Overall, I did not enjoy my experience at Sushi Kai. The fish selection was standard and unfortunately, they did not taste fresh. The chef lacked experience and the service was not very friendly. Additionally, the leftover rice and sauce residue was not properly cleaned. I would not recommend this restaurant based on these factors.",1
"Ordered:The Amorino Signature (~$9): infamous Amorino gelato flower in a chocolate-flavored cone with a macaron on top. Macaron I chose: pistachio. Flavors I chose: refreshing jasmine, mango, strawberry, banana, passionfruit, stracciatella , mascarpone with fig, blueberry cheesecake, and pistachio.Aya's take: omg, the amount of joy this gelato brought me is unreal. I love the variety they have and that you can put as many flavors as you want (until they run out of space really). Pro tip: tell them your favorite flavor first because that will be the base before adding other flavors you want around it to create the flower shape.",0
"Good sushi and sashimi. Delivery was faster than expected and the quality was good. The Kani salad, shumai, blue fin tuna (sashimi), yellowtail (sashimi), crispy rice (I got the spicy crunch tuna), wonderland roll, and peanut avocado roll were all what I expected. Not disappointed with anything I got. I wanted to order more, but I don't like to keep sushi in the fridge for the next day, so I'll try some other things next time I order... but the Kani salad and shumai will be ordered again for sure.",0
"I've been to The Smith several times at various locations. We ordered the chips & blue cheese, salmon tartare, burgers, veggie burger, chicken sandwich & coffee, cookies. The salmon had a bit of a nova taste. This was the first time trying the veggie burger--it was delicious, the only change I would make is to cut the added vegetables so it's less messy. The cookies were amazing & loved the cappuccino.",0
"Naruto is a small, narrow restaurant with only counter-top seating. This can be challenging when large groups are visiting, as there is not enough space to comfortably sit together. We were unfortunate to experience this firsthand, as our party of eight was scattered around the small establishment. Our orders were taken and completed at different times, which made it difficult to re-group and enjoy our meal. When seats did open up, we were not allowed to sit next to each other, as the restaurant had other specific group sizes in mind. Despite our difficulties, we all enjoyed the food at Naruto. I had tan tan ramen, which was simple but had a good broth and noodles. The flavors were nice, but it felt like a more affordable meal overall. The environment was not as conducive to a great dining experience, as the space was small and crowded. The customer service could have been better, as we were not able to sit together comfortably and were constantly having to re-adjust our seats. Despite these flaws, I would recommend Naruto to others if they are looking for a simple, affordable meal.",1
"We had a great time at Vic's, thanks in part to the attentive service and delicious food. The garlic bread was a bit too garlicy for my taste, but the crispy sweet onions were delicious. The ravioli was a real winner – it was so filling and hearty! And the dipping sauce was amazing. The Rigatoni with Sausage and Broccoli Raab was also very good, but it was a bit too spicy for us. Our bottle of chardonnay was top-notch, and the price was reasonable. Overall, we had a great experience at Vic's and would definitely come back.",1
"Came here after the American Natural History Museum.We got seated right away, and served water shortly after.We ordered the Shoyu Ramen, Tonkatsu ramen, Volcano Tonkatsu Ramen and the Kuro Ramen.My daughter had the shoyu ramen, she really liked it! I tasted her broth and it wasn't too salty like some other places could be. Some places tend to skimp on the noodles, but not this place! It's just enough.The Tonkatsu ramen was with the house noodles. The broth was tasty. It wasn't oily or too rich! The noodle serving was also perfect! The house noodles are a bit thicker and wavy. The other ramens were served with the house noodles which were thinner.The Kuro Tonkatsu was ok. It was different cause it had shishito peppers inside! Yum! The Volcano Tonkatsu Ramen was super spicy! Spicy but good!!! All-in-all this place was good! It was so worth it! Warm bowl of ramen on a chilly Dec afternoon!",0
I love this sandwich place! The sandwiches are fresh and delicious and the prices are good. The service is great and I love that you order for yourself on the electronic pads and wait for your food at the counter. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place!,1
"I've been to the Boucherie in the west village, but never tried La Grande Boucherie. Came here for a brunch with my friends. Great ambience, nice decoration, but the service and operation were definitely problematic. My friend asked for water three times before she was finally served, and there was no introduction of the courses on the menu, the waiter simply rushed us to make decisions. After the orders were placed, we waited for at least 25 mins without anyone coming to our table checking on us, it was very difficult to get waiter's attention. The food was alright, we ordered steak tartare to share, my friends ordered the Eggs Benedict, the omelette,and the lobster, I ordered the Baked Chatham Cod. I like the combination of the jumbo lump crab and sauce hollandaise on the top of the cod. Overall, it was so so.",0
"Ive walked past this place numerous times as it is in the vicinity of my office.  So being super hungry, I came in to get a bite for lunch. The guys in front are busy making pizzas, and were very friendly.  I got my slice and was shocked how tiny it was. Maybe it was a fluke.The cashier was soft spoken and she too was very nice. I asked her about the size of the slice and she let me know, only the cheese slices are big.  The the price.  only reason I gave them 3 stars is for the service and the fact the pepperoni was beef. Because $4.25 - 4.50 for a small, basic slice of lukewarm, sugary sauced pizza is not how this NYC slice thing works.  At least the crust was good.",0
"Went to Harry's with a few coworkers for lunch last Thursday because we were craving a yummy crispy slice of pizza. We walked over during the lunch hour and it was the busy lunch rush. The line moved quickly, we ordered and waited less than 5 minutes for our pizza. This location is inside Rockefeller center and so it's small and not meant for you to have a sit down meal. We stood and quickly ate our slices. I ordered a mushroom slice and was really expecting it to be great. But it was just okay - the slice was semi warm and not crispy. It was a bit soft in the middle and that's not at all what I wanted. But since it was quick meal we just ate and left. I would have really enjoyed it if it was just a little warmer. I've had Harry's in the past and they are known to me be good. Next time I'll ask for it to be warmer to make sure I enjoy it.",0
"I ordered from Seamless yesterday. I am celiac (allergic to gluten) and can confirm that the Pad See Ew with shrimp is safe and delicious. There are a few items on the menu that are gluten free - indicated on the menu, which I really appreciate. Delivery was super fast - like 20 minutes. Food arrived steaming hot. They were not stingy about the shrimp. Will definitely order from here again.",0
I thought I already gave a glowing review but here we go . . . we loved the new twist on Korean food.  I'm a traditional Korean food purist being Korean.  8282 came to our rescue by accepting out last minute on 2022 New Years Eve for dinner for 10 of us.  We tried almost all of their menu and ordered more so that we can all taste and share.  Met the gifted chief learned about meaning of 8282 (from pager time before cell phones/ now used as SOS texting),0
"This place is great for coffee and people watching! The coffee is great and the prices are average for NYC, but the place has a lot of character. The seating outside is great, and I would definitely recommend it!",1
Came here again with reservations through here with my boyfriend. I absolutely love this restaurant and the service. the waiters were super friendly and respectful. we sat outdoors yesterday as it wasn't super cold and they have heaters above each tables. i got the linguine cicale and my boyfriend got the veal parm. we absolutely loved our food and we enjoyed their calamari again. the atmosphere outside was super nice and not many people walking by us - assuming it was sunday night so it was not as busy & there was a downpour of rain when we were eating our meal so that was fun to watch. they have a great scaffolding overhead thing that blocks out all the rain too. they played great throwback r&b and hip hop music outdoors and it wasn't so loud at all. i'm shocked that they have low ratings here! food is 10/10 and service was 1000/10. we had our bread burnt and we didn't mind it but the server gave us a new batch of bread too. i'd come here again  and bring my friends next time!,0
"The food was great. The drinks were amazing. The atmosphere and decor are beautiful and trendy looking. My issue with this place is that they canceled our reservation, on the day of, twice. I can understand one of the closures (it was inclement weather so ""The Lodge"" set up on their rooftop had to close). The other closure was due to a special event where someone bought out the rooftop. For the second instance I felt we were notified a little too late. I would've liked more advance warning. Despite that, I will say again that the food, drinks, desserts and service were really good but it's hard to make up for the disappointment of the change-up of plans that had been weeks in the making. I've been able to dine there twice. You should check it out but be ready to call an audible and ad lib some new plans on the fly. You've been warned.",0
"Wah Fung holds a special place in my heart. Not because it's some of the best Chinese BBQ around (it is). And not because it's incredibly cheap for the ridiculous portion sizes ($6.50 for a ""large""??). But because when I came home from college on the dangerous Chinatown bus, my dad would pick me up and buy me a combo meat over rice from Wah Fung.I recently went back because I was in the area and these Chinatown businesses need some support (due to all the idiots who stopped going to Chinatown because of Coronavirus fears). The line was pretty short. I hope it's just because it was a random Tuesday, but I reaped the benefits.Waited just a few minutes, and it was my time to order. Got the char siu and the crispy roast pork belly. It took a lot of willpower not to start eating it on the subway home (since they don't have a seating area), but I made it all the way back, and was promptly rewarded with some delicious, fatty, diet-killing roast meat. The char siu was perfect, and the pork belly was so incredibly fatty and juicy. Not to mention the ""sauce"" they ladle on top of everything. I have no idea what's in it (and probably don't want to know), but it's amazing.Oh, and there were some vegetables too.Thankfully, I have a small shred of dignity left, so I saved some for lunch the next day. Delicious, fatty lunch.",0
"La Contenta has been hard to snag a dinner spot here given the limited seating and the inability to make a reservation. But we thought it was a better time to go for a weekday lunch during my staycation. The coffee was good and so were their cocktails, which were very cheap during the lunch hour for about 9 dollars a drink. We each ended up getting two. The pear one was delicious. I was less of a fan of my second drink, which was the mimosa mainly because it required serial dilutions of water to  balance out the sweetness. My friend got the french toast which started out delicious but did become a little soggy from being doused with syrup and whatever jam they put on it. My fish tacos were good, but nothing spectacular. I am afraid to admit and agree with the west coast folks that NYC's taco scene needs a reinvigoration. I would check this out again for brunch/lunch and happy hour but not sure if the food is worth the 30+ minute dinner wait.",1
I'm glad I finally gave Momoya a try after reading the positive reviews. The sashimi was fresh and the delivery was quick. It definitely improved from my last visit. I would definitely recommend it to others.,1
"I came in here 15 minutes before closing and the cashier informed me that she had already ""deactivated"" the crepe maker and I would not be able to get one. She said this somewhat sharply and unapologetically, even though it seems a bit absurd: 1. the business, barring instances of sold out products, should be able to provide all items listed on the menu until the moment of closing. If an employee needs to clean equipment that was in use after their shift, they should of course be compensated for such an effort - but they should not pre-emptively shut down items to accelerate the process of closing. 2. This is a crepe plate, not a centrifuge; why could it not simply be turned back on, even if that would require cleaning it's surface once more or re-oiling it? It is simply not a sufficiently complex piece of equipment for this explanation to be cogent. In place of my phantom crepe, the cashier offered to make a waffle. Obviously, I said no thanks as that is quite dissimilar to what I was seeking. I can't actually attest to the taste of the food, but I am granting three stars anyway for two reasons: A. it looked good, and I'm offering them the benefit of the doubt B. I appreciate the expansive menu.",0
"I had a really bad experience at Wolfgang's on NYE. The hostess was rude and said ""give me your Covid vaccine proof"", not really a nice way to say hello lol. The food is always amazing, but I would not recommend this restaurant if you're looking for great service.",1
Adrienne's Pizza is a great place to go for a casual meal. The pizza is delicious and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and they are always quick to bring out your food. I highly recommend Adrienne's Pizza to anyone looking for a good slice of pizza in the Financial District.,1
"Lovely early dinner here tonight: halloumi, spicy lamb and the peri peri chicken all highly recommended. Great interplay of flavors with the halloumi appetizer and the lamb and chicken were both beautifully seasoned and meltingly tender. More than enough for two. We also had a wonderful dessert - Mala pudding, I think? - that's basically a moist and enticing little cake served under a veritable mountain of whipped cream. So simple and yet so amazing. Do yourself a favor and order it. Margaritas: we asked for them to be not too sweet. They were perfect.Waitstaff: cheerful, funny, divine",0
"Came here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner. The lunch specials are pretty good, and left feeling quite full. For dinner, dishes are served in smaller portions, similar to tapa-style, so we got a variety of dishes to share!My favorites included the: Salmon Tataki, Daichi Mushrooms and Curry Cream Udon!! The Daichi Mushrooms actually blew me away - wasn't expecting so much flavor out of these and I would go back just for this dish! Tried the MaLa Kara Pork and Pork Tongue yakitori, but they were a little tough to eat, and a bit expensive at ~$5/stick. Will probably stick with their other dishes. The yakitori included in the lunch set was much better, but they were pretty standard meats like chicken.",0
A great find and a nice local flavor diner.We had a great breakfast and there was no wait. Will be back again. They had some really nice dishes to choose from for breakfast,0
"Emily West Village is a hidden little gem tucked away on a small quiet street in New York. The waitstaff was friendly and looked through my guy friend's schedule to see where he could fit us - he sat us right away. We were a little early, but the waitstaff was friendly and looked through his schedule to see where he could fit us. The place was a little strange because we were so close together, but it was a small place and everyone was close together. My friend was raving about some burger they are known for, and I thought the pizza sounded good. Chicago style is kinda like pan pizza, and I know I like pan pizza so I went with the grammy which is basically a cheese pizza. He got the burger and fries which was one of their best sellers. I noticed everyone in the spot had pizza on their tables, so I think my choice was a good one. His burger was huge and juicy and came with a ton of curly fries. My pizza was crispy and cheesy and so flavorful. I was so happy and my stomach was happy. This was the first time in weeks I felt like finally showing my new guy friend I can eat like a beast - and I did. I ended up eating about 3 slices of the pizza",1
"I really like this place. It's a relaxed, yet a lil fancy French restaurant in a location without many of them around. The cocktails are pretty good, but I haven't found one I really like yet. The service is great, and the food is generally high quality. I find it a little pricey but worth it for the quality. The only downside is that it's cash-only.",1
"We stopped by this restaurant after seeing the long line and were glad we did. The roast pork or chicken over rice was only $4.50 and was very filling. The roast duck was also good, though a bit salty. Overall, a good restaurant for quick and easy eats.",1
"Came here for brunch for the first time with my mom, aunt and grandmother. I was the only one that partook in the unlimited boozy brunch. I had some flavored margaritas that were pretty good. Definitely got a good buzz after 3 of them. For food we shared a guacamole that was delicious, it also came with a few different sauces. I picked a salad to have as my main, not sure which one it was but it had so many good things on it! Very good, though I wished they gave it to me mixed. All the different ingredients were in a line in the salad when I got it. My aunt really enjoyed the enchiladas!",0
"Gosuke is a great new sushi restaurant located inside the Henn Na hotel at 235 W 35th Street, roughly halfway between Penn Station and Herald Square. The restaurant is modern and stylish, and the sushi chef was kind enough to accommodate my shellfish allergy. The sushi was fresh and delicious, and I especially enjoyed the fatty tuna. The sashimi was also excellent, with great flavors and a variety of cuts of seafood. The toro taku roll was a nice addition to the meal, and the prices were reasonable. The only downside was that the menu is in Japanese, which can be a bit difficult to understand. Hotel guests get 20% off their first visit.",1
Came back again and just had to show how CHONKY these tacos are. Absolutely delicious and yummy.I will say - don't order a tostada for takeout unless you eat it right away as it gets hard quickly. Overall so great though and my tostadas to go also came with another tostada tortilla!,0
"Sarabeth's is a lovely local respite in Chelsea Market. If you're feeling overwhelmed with the swarms of tourists or the masses of people on the High Line, I would especially recommend this small magical enclave of baked goods. The fruit pies are fresh, seasonal and adorably wrapped in a hatch mark crispy dough covered in crunchy sugar. Tea and cookies are a little on the pricey side, but lovely to munch on while sitting at one of the high tables, perusing through one of the Sarabeth's catalogues. Highly recommend!",0
I love this place for game watches in the winter! The specials are always good and the food is always delicious. I especially love the Mac and cheese - it's one of my favorite dishes here. It's very filling and tastes great. I highly recommend this place!,1
"Cheapest dim sum in Chinatown. Bang for your buck. Menu is big and bold, they give free water. Don't expect your food to come out on a fancy ceramic plate with flower petals - it literally comes out on a paper plate (not an issue whatsoever, the food is what's important).Cashier (the younger girl) was a bit rude, you can tell she definitely didn't want to be there LOL. Our food did take awhile to come out (15 mins) for three orders. Seating tables were gigantic, lots of space inside.",0
"I visited this restaurant and was impressed by the cleanliness of the store. The order process was easy and I picked up my food without any problems. Unfortunately, the lamb gyro at Mahmoun's wasn't as good as I had hoped. The sauce was spilled in the bag, so I had to clean it up before I could eat. The lamb itself was greasy and heavy, and the salad looked better than it tasted. I'll try Mahmoun's again, but I'll probably go with something else on the menu.",1
"I had a great time trying out some Singaporean cuisine at this restaurant! The food was very spicy, but not too salty, and the flavors were very unique. I especially loved the sticky rice with spicy bean paste - it was delicious! The seating arrangement is also really convenient - you can help yourself from the buffet line or order from the menu.",1
"Love their burritos, ready quickly and always hot. Sodas are delicious, and prices can't be beat.They are willing to customize your burrito- I like less rice and more cheese, and my roommate prefers no sour cream. Their guac is delicious if you want to splurge a bit! When the weather is nice, you can sit outside at their outdoor tables. (No heat, but the burrito keeps you warm in cold weather!)My new go-to burrito spot.",0
"The udon here is good, but I wish there were more cold options on the menu. Regardless, the servings are huge and the noodles are chewy. There was no wait on a Sunday at noon.",1
"I had a lot of fun at Churrascaria Plataforma! The price is a bit high, but it was an interesting experience to try at least once. The salad bar was a nice addition, with different types of cold appetizers such as roast beef, salads, sushi, stuffed grape leaves. The sushi wasn't the best quality or the freshest, but it was satisfying. The meat was good, but some of it was a bit too salty. The service was excellent and very friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"I've tried Lolos on two different occasions and both experiences were completely different. The first time I went there I ordered a warm bowl with dirty rice, shrimp and broccoli and I was not impressed. The dirty rice was  overcooked and lacked seasoning in my opinion. The shrimp and the broccoli were decent at best but featured a ton of curry flavoring that really wasnt expected. The second time I had Lolos was at work when they donated meals to hospital staff in the ICU. We received a large piece of jerk chicken and fried rice and it was delicious! The jerk chicken was cooked to perfection! It was juicy, tender and paired perfectly with the rice. That meal renewed my hope in Lolo's. Definitely worth giving it a shot!",0
This restaurant was hopping on a Sunday evening and we were able to snag a table for two outside. The service was quick and the food arrived shortly after. I ordered the standard pad see ewe dish with a side of garlic rice and it was delicious. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was hot and tangy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.,1
"I have heard so many good things about this place all over social media and I was so excited when they opened a location here in New York. It is like a fast food type of service where you order right when you walk in. They give you a number and they will serve you the food when ready. Since it is a ""cook for yourself"" type of meal, the food comes out within 5 minutes. I got the Sambar Pepper Rice and I thought it tasted pretty good. The rice with the sauce was great, but I felt like the beef could've had a little more flavor to it. Overall, I would definitely return to Pepper Lunch whenever I'm in the area.",0
"I absolutely love Bodhi Kosher Vegetarian Restaurant! The food is always delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I especially love the variety of dim sum they offer, as well as the vegan sushi option. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great vegetarian meal.",1
"PURCHASED: 10 wings  TOTAL: $14PROS:+ 50-cent wings on Wednesday: This is awesome, if they uphold what they promised (please see CONS section below). The best flavor is original (no sauce). CONS:- unreliable price: Upon arriving and sitting down, we were instructed that the wings on Wednesday are full priced. We have been coming for approximately 6 months. There have been games that were on before when we had gone in the past. We went during the NBA finals (Golden State vs Raptors). The price for 10 wings were $14. This ruined my experience of this location. Therefore, I will need to deduct points from Professor Thom's - phones are unattended: I called Professor Thom's number to confirm the weekly specials. No one was available. There were several different options to call (""press 3 for booking a watch party""). - high-turnover of waitress/staff: We have been coming for approximately the past 10-11 months on Wednesday. You can always tell how well management/bar is run. There is high turnover which is very unfortunate for the servers. - wings: nope... they were like left over or cooked extra. Tasted better than stale, but less than fresh. IMPRESSION:This location is more of a 3.5 stars at the present time. I will actually return because I have had good experiences. However, not indicating that the 50-cent wings special--and the reason why we made this our destination for the evening-- was honored was a major turn off.",0
"This place was a complete waste of time - not even the Seattle Sounders game was being shown! The staff were nice enough, but they all left after just one drink because they couldn't get the game we wanted to watch switched on. Definitely not worth checking out if you're a Sounders fan - go somewhere else!",1
"Is this a 5 star gourmet restaurant?  Nope, not by a long shot.Is it a 5 star diner?  Absolutely, yes!We were visiting NYC and were looking for lunch as we continued our sightseeing for the day.  We walked up and down the street, and for some reason, this place intrigued us.  We took and chance and went in, and am I ever glad we did!It's loud, crowded, noisy, full of hustle and bustle.  They serve an incredible amount of people, and they do it well.  We were seated promptly, and our server was at our table right away.  I settled on the Galaxy burger, and, indeed, it was a damn fine burger.  the first were great, too.If you're looking for not only a traditional diner, but a great place to people watch, you can't go wrong here.",0
Food is pretty decent and tastes fresh. Wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu,0
"I came on a weekend during COVID so a lot of Chelsea market restaurants were closed. It ended up working out because I got to try The Lobster Place! I'm happy I did because I ended up really enjoying the meal. I ordered through the outside window and sat at one of the heated booths (it's well heated and separated from other tables). I got the warm lobster roll and my SO got the Hokkaido bowl. Our two friends got the lobster roll picnic lunch (with a roll, chips, and clam chowder). I thought the lobster roll was great though (as is usually the case) very small and $$. I got a chance to try my friends clam chowder and that was really yummy and great for a cold day (also nice for something a little more filling). I had the shrimp from my SO's Hokkaido bowl but didn't try anything else. The shrimp was really fresh though so I assume everything else was as it should have been. Overall a nice meal if you're willing to spend a bit more for lunch.",0
"This is the place I choose to celebrate my sister's birthday. I must say it was a wonderful experience we reserved the igloo in the back and I am very glad we did.  The hostess was very nice and when I called to push back the reservation 30 minutes she said np. When we arrived they were setting up the table and we waited about 5 minutes which was fine. Then when we went to back it was very nicely decorated with plants. My family also enjoyed the privacy of the igloo. We ordered appetizers and the meatballs were amazing. I did order two crostini which were ok, my friend loves them. We could just have a difference in taste. For the main course I had the sauce with porterhouse steak, which I enjoyed very much. My niece had the adult version of the chicken parmigiana and my sister had the butter sage noodles. I would definitely be back; I enjoyed the food, the service and place itself. It was very pretty and the igloo gave us privacy.",0
"Get dressed up, go on a date, celebrate your birthday, anniversary or just chill, but def do it at Beauty and Essex. Enter this speak easy through what looks like a pawn shop and end up in a beautiful dinning room where picture ops are a must. Esp on the amazing stair case w/ the huge chandelier leading to the 2nd floor. The food is good and the staff is there to please. This is one of the spots where you might order something and it come out super tiny, leaving you to wonder if you'll leave full after paying you're expensive bill. Well if you go with what we had you def won't be disappointed. We tried:Appetizers:-Crispy Vidalia onion rings-Mac & cheese Entrees:-Chile Spiced Dry Aged Burger & crispy bbq fries -Grilled double Cut Lamb Chops w/ creamy polenta & port wine glazeDrinks:-ODB-Cheeky Palm-SunslipDessert:-Housemade cookie-complementary birthday cupcake(I'd pass on the plant based arepas, they were 3 tiny bites so we sent them back)",0
"I absolutely enjoyed my meal at this restaurant! The pork belly was very flavorful and I loved the char on it. It was a little thicker than I was used to, but that didn't bother me. The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. The broth was also very flavorful and had a great balance of flavor. The only downside was that the portions were a little smaller than I was used to, but that didn't stop me from enjoying my meal. The restaurant itself is very charming and the staff is very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great pork belly ramen.",1
"Went here for happy hour drinks and it was a nice relaxed vibe. Weather was nice so sat outdoors and enjoyed the scenery. This place does a good job as far as partitions and separating everyone, so I have to give them credit for that. Also the staff was very nice and very accommodating. Nice vibe, nice scenery, and good staff, definitely looking forward to coming here again.",0
"OK here's the deal, only reviewing after having dined in (5 stars) and ordered takeaway (2 stars, underwhelming). So dining in (or outdoor dining in this case) was amazing, the smell of kebabs in the grill enthralled all the diners. Attentive wait staff and just generally a damn good meal. Order the lamb chops, some naan, wash it down with a mango lassi, all good and delicious. Ordered delivery based on my dining experience (candidly from a couple of months ago) and it just wasn't the same. Ordered a chicken biryani and some chicken tikka. Tikka spices weren't cooked all the way through and tasted too earthy? And the biryani unfortunately didn't have the delicate basmati and chicken flavor one hopes for at finer establishments like Rahi. Instead it was more of a mush of curry and rice with the rice quality not quite refined, grainy basmati. Will not be ordering the biryani again.So net-net, great dining experience, underwhelming takeaway experience. Recommend atleast checking out once, probably the best indian option in the west village so not like there's a ton of options if you're craving Indian.",0
"I was really disappointed with my meal at this restaurant. The bread was cold and dry, the butter was not soft, and the shrimp cocktail was tough. The bisque was watery and lacked flavor, and the chicken salad was old and wilted. The hamburger was gross, and the apple pie and key lime pie were both terrible. Save your money and go to a pizza place instead.",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The chicken dumplings were delicious and reasonably priced. The soy sauce was included and nicely packaged. The service was fine. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot!",1
"My second visit to a Sweet Chick after previously eating at the location in LIC. I got lunch with my girlfriend and her father. They were serving the brunch menu, so we picked a few things to share. My girlfriend and I split a breakfast burrito, which had previously been quite good at the other location. This time, the burrito was smaller, with way less chicken. Big disappointment, as the chicken is tasty here. The side of mac and cheese also fell flat. Not worth the $11 price tag. I also got to try the pancakes, which were decent. Shouldn't have been the highlight of the meal, but there you have it.",0
"The food was good and the place is beautiful.The traffic was however horrible. such a nasty hostess and rude to no end. this was sour first time here and she has like yelling hurry but you think I have all day? Ugh, so as good as it was we will skip this place on our next visit",0
"I visited Peppercorn Station for dinner and found the food to be tasty but not spicy enough. The Braised Beef Noodle Soup was pretty close to perfect, with a hearty flavor and a nice balance of spices. The Pepper Garlic Cabbage was well flavored, but I found it to be a bit too spicy for my taste. The Mala Chicken had the right notes, but the chicken was too small and bony--so I would recommend skipping this dish unless you like picking cartilage from your teeth. The space is kinda low-ceilinged and modern, like dining in a trendy tunnel, which made the experience a bit more enjoyable.",1
I visited this restaurant for lunch and was really impressed. Everything on the menu is really fresh and well portioned. I tried the bulgogi and galbi and both were really delicious! I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick and tasty lunch.,1
"Healthy options offered but no nutritional information actually offered. Rather limited menu - and no ""create your own"" salad or bowl. I ordered a custom made one - it didn't happen. What I ate was good, but not what I wanted or ordered.UPDATE - it was nice to see that the manager responded to my comment. But my request for a custom salad was medically based (allergies) - not out of preferences. I explained this, and was still told no accommodations.",0
"I stopped by this restaurant for St. Patrick's Day this year and it was definitely a different vibe than last year. It was still very busy, but there were enough open spaces so it wasn't too crowded. The bar was a great place to sit, and the drinks we tried (Carlsberg beer and Irish bombs) were both good. The chicken sliders were also very good and I especially liked the fries. The prices are reasonable, and the service was good. Based on this experience, I would rate this restaurant as 4 out of 5 stars.",1
"Came at ~630 on a weeknight and was immediately seated. The restaurant looks really small from the front, but there's a nice area in the back that loops around to provide lots more seating. Seats were pretty close together and there was a man nearby who was coughing which was alarming.Got the vegetable dumplings to share and I got the tofu pad thai (tofu was more expensive than chicken for some reason fyi). Vegetable dumplings were good, but the skin was a bit odd. The little slice of pepper on top added a nice flavorful kick to the dish.Tofu pad thai was quite large and a solid dish. The noodles didn't taste very fresh or stretchy, but it was a pretty good dish and one of the better Thai spots in this neighborhood. Service was great throughout with our water never falling below 1/2 full. Great Thai spot in HK and would definitely come back if I'm in the area!",0
"I visited this restaurant and I absolutely loved the pork tacos! The chicken taco was also really good, but I think I prefer the pork tacos. The menu is really simple, either you get beef, pork, or taco options, but unfortunately they do not have any fish or mushroom options. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back!",1
"Hutaloi is a fun, vibrant restaurant with great physical space and engaging decor. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the high standards set by the environment. It tasted moderately good, but was not very memorable. The cocktails were similarly unremarkable. Overall, I would say that it is worth checking out, but I caution against expecting a great dining experience.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The tamales were affordable and delicious, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I would definitely come back and recommend it to others.",1
"Le Prive had high expectations from me based on the other reviews, but unfortunately I had some major issues. My reservation was easily made, but we were seated at 6:05 and had to wait for our food for a long time. Our friend who ordered the cheese plate got her cheese plate pretty quick, but then we didn't receive our food for another 20 minutes. Finally around 7:20 we received our food, which was unfortunately overcooked. Overall, the food was disappointing and I'm sad to give such a low review.",1
"I made a reservation for a party of 4 for a weekend dinner. To my surprise, Kilo is small but nevertheless this place was packed. It was disappointing when they seated us at a small table that didn't allow much room to maneuver nor did it have enough space for the dishes we ordered. The menu is seasonal and the foods are fresh but taste wise, it's pretty average which I didn't really care for. I enjoyed the octopus. Mushroom tacos are good and definitely recommended if you're a vegan. Basa catfish was alright and the Fingerlakes grass-fed ribeye was tasty. However I didn't like the burrata one bit. Overall, this place seems more appropriate for much smaller parties.",0
"Murphy's Law is a decent bar, but I wouldn't recommend their food. The boneless chicken wings were terrible and the nachos were pretty sad. I'm not sure if the beer or burgers are any better, but I didn't try them. All in all, it's a decent spot for a drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",1
"I've been here multiple times, and it's a pretty reliable and consistent spot with a decent craft beer list featuring many local brews to try, both on tap and in can/bottle.  Food is fine, although I usually just get ""bar food.""  This past trip the cheese curds and buffalo wings hit the spot.  It is pretty much in Times Square but does not seem like a corporate tourist trap.  good quality all around.  Service has always been fine too.The only snafu that I hit was a few months ago I was carded (i'm in my late 40s) which is perfectly fine, but they used some scanning app that didn't accept my driver's license.  So I couldn't get in. This past weekend they didn't use that app, I don't know, maybe they got other complaints that it wasn't reliable.",0
"I tried out this cantonese roast meat spot and overall it was okay. The meat was a little hit and miss, but my favorite dish was the pipa duck. It was a lot less greasy and had a really crispy thin skin. The cuttlefish was also interesting to try, and it had great texture and with the sauce it was really good. The honey roast spare rib was a bit dry, but the honey roast chicken wing was not very tender and not very yummy. Overall, the place is affordable and there are a lot of varieties to choose from, but the quality could be improved a little.",1
"Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Jongro. The only negative part was trying to join the waitlist for a table, which was chaotic and crowded near the entrance. However, once we were able to join the list everything went much smoother. The food was high quality, and all of the complimentary side dishes were delicious. The cocktail selection was a bit small, but all of them we tried were really good. Overall, we would definitely recommend Jongro to others.",1
"The food was delicious, but it wasn't filling at all. It was pretty pricey for what it's worth, but I guess that's NYC for ya. The portions were also quite small, so I'm docking a star off. Everyone enjoyed their meal, but they were still fairly hungry after. That's why I'm awarding four stars.",1
What a great find in the busy midtown Manhattan area! Beautiful great Gatsby-style bar with plenty of tables to sit in a nice space in a back. Signature and specialty cocktails are delicious. The menu is amazing and food is absolutely delicious. Service is quick and attentive. They have a space upstairs as well that would be good for a holiday party. Really fun spot to grab a drink and a bite after work. Cocktails are a bit pricey but are worth it. They also have a happy hour that runs until 7pm.,0
"I came here for lunch during the week and I thought this location paled in comparison to other poke spots throughout the city. The protein portion given was fairly small and for the two ""spiciest"" options with quite a lot of seasoning and spices listed they were pretty lacking in flavor. The edamame was ice cold, even compared to the other add ins. The crunchies also did not have much flavor (I know the flavor is typically secondary for those, but for wasabi peas and garlic crisps you'd expect something). Overall, I think there are significantly better poke options in the area in the same price range.",1
"Was in UES yesterday, our old neighborhood, decided to walk around and ended up having dinner here.First time at a Luke's Lobster so I was trying to not have the highest expectations versus what we've enjoyed in Newport, RI. Turned out to be really good!I ordered the lobster roll with bisque and drink, opted to upgrade to a 6 oz rosé for an additional $8. Hubby had the crab roll + lobster mac & cheese. And yep, strategically always good for sharing everything! Their bisque was deliciously comforting. The lobster mac & cheese was actually surprisingly really good. Hubby enjoyed the crab roll and I also loved the lobster roll. They have a small outdoor dining area outside and on a beautiful not so cold evening, this was absolutely perfect!Staff were also great. Polite, smiling, actually liked taking care of customers type. May actually use that loyalty card as it works for UWS branches too! On our way out, we waved and thanked the team who took care of us, with a quick thumbs up! Thanks guys! This will definitely help satisfy our New England cravings until it's safe to be traveling again! We'll be back!",0
"Caribbean cuisine on restaurant row, what a delightful sight. Especially with the vibrant outside décor. Service was good and staff friendly. Everything was cool but did not knock my socks off.For appetizers we had the pepper shrimp, codfish fritters and crab cake. The pepper shrimp to my surprise was de-shelled (that's a first). It was extremely pepper.. we could not finish it, Ii had to send it back. The fritters were more like fish cakes and the crab cakes were delicious.We tried the jazzy pasta which was yummy and flavorful. The drinks were good as well.A BONUS...the owner was on premises. It was nice to see her moving around and interacting with patrons and staff. I would come back just for drinks and an appetizer or two. But entrees were okay.",0
"Located in Harlem right by the George Washington bridge and Hudson river, this sports bar is super chill. Came here last night (Saturday before Super Bowl Sunday) around 830p and it was on the empty side. As the night went on, the crowd began to pack in and the security guard was checking IDs at the front door. The bar has many seats and tables for groups of friends to sit and enjoy themselves. The food is typical, mediocre bar food. The price of the food and drinks is the main reason why people come to 123. Sliders are $1 (must order minimum of 3), shots $2, and beer $3. I was with a group of 4 people and we spent $40 each. I personally suggest trying their Rum Hooch punch its Delicious!Negatives I would add are the bathrooms are unisex in the back of the bar, and the music was pretty terrible lol.",0
"The Forbidden Room served up some delectable dishes for my friend's birthday brunch. My favorite dish was the chicken satay, which was incredibly tender and full of flavor. The edamame dumplings were also a real hit, and I enjoyed the spicy tuna crispy rice as well. The only downside was the frozen rose drink, which was a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, though, I had a great time dining here and would definitely recommend giving them a try!",1
Not bad Buffalo chicken pizza. 4 bucks but a little oily. Really flavorful though-I'd grab a slice again. Crispy bottom and crispy crust,0
"I wasn't sure why people were so excited about this restaurant, especially given the reservations requirement. The rooftop view is really nothing special, and the seating arrangement is really tight. Fortunately our waitress was really sweet and patient. The food was mediocre, and the drinks were okay. I probably wouldn't return here, but it does have potential post-covid.",1
"You would think that the hype for this place would have died down by now but unfortunately for the customers it's still ongoing. I waited in line with friends for an hour to get some breakfast food. I ordered their fish congee and marinated beef, shrimp with chives rice roll, and Hong Kong Milk Tea. I wish the fish was softer, but at least it's boneless. I requested for no scallions or chives in my congee and said yes to cilantros, and they truly dumped a huge handful of cilantros in. That was quite an overwhelming amount and kind of took over the taste of the congee. I found it tasty otherwise though. Their marinated beef and shrimp with chives rice roll was not bad either, but was heavy on the chives. I also found their milk tea quite bitter but they do provide sugar at the table separately for us to adjust the sweetness ourselves. Another thing is that the prices for everything is more expensive than what you may find at a typical dim sum place. I spent $15 (pre-tax + tip) by myself on congee, rice roll, and a small cup of milk tea. Overall, food is decent but not enough for me to get on that one hour line again.",0
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The Drag Queen brunch was really fun, but the overall experience wasn't great. The food was okay, but nothing special. The drinks were strong, though. The service was great, though small and quick.",1
I had a great time at Tang Hotpot! The atmosphere was very chic and the service was great. The food was fantastic and I especially loved the dipping sauces. All of the meats and vegetables were cooked perfectly and the plating was simple but very well done. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great hotpot experience.,1
"I visited the restaurant based on the good reviews and was not disappointed. The place was pretty busy near dinner time, so it was hard to find a seat inside. We were seated quickly though, and found the menu to be a bit confusing. There are a lot of options for customizing your dish, but the menu items themselves list the dish with a specific protein configuration (ie. pork, chicken, tofu). I'm not sure why they don't just list the dish as ""pad thai"" and let you choose the protein. The tofu/vegetarian option was actually $1 more than the pork/chicken option, which always confuses me. The tofu was flavorful, but nothing special. The rice was a bit dry and hard, but I'm okay with that because the sauce was delicious. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
I had a great time at Luchadores! The food was great and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend it to others. It's also a great place to go if you're looking for a casual date night. The only downside is that the tacos are a bit expensive.,1
"So happy that I found this place! It's reasonably priced and has awesome food. I ordered their lunch special, the pad see eew with spring rolls and Thai iced coffee. It came super fast, was packaged very nicely, and food was delicious. Will definitely be ordering here more often seeing as how it's so close to my apartment. Can't wait to try out the other items on the menu.",0
"Came here on a busy Sunday brunch. The bar is in the front, and it may seem like a small space walking in. Once you continue past the server podium, you see that it is actually a huge dining room with a balcony. They were very busy when we arrived, but the server was so attentive and made sure we were doing ok. We had the hot honey chicken and toast, lumber jack stack and coffee/mimosas. The food was very good and I love that you can tell they use fresh orange juice in their mimosas. The hot honey chicken was medium in heat and was able to fully enjoy the food without guzzling water. The toast was thick and both our meals were good portions.I believe this is the brother restaurant of Jacob's Pickles (my preference) and both are really good.",0
"I have tried very hard to like this place because of the proximity to my apartment. However, the second and last time I came here the food was so truly inedible that I cannot justify returning.We ordered take out last week and I had the tan tan ramen, partner had the classic, and we split the pork belly buns -- our classic order. I had high hopes having not been here in a year, but was greatly disappointed as this experience was significantly worse than it was.The pork buns were inedible. The meat was literally a hunk of fat. I was so repulsed I ended up throwing away the entire bun and vomiting. My partner felt the same way. The tan tan ramen was aggressively sesame-y, almost to the point of taking on a peanut butter flavor, and overpowered the entire dish. Needless to say, I ended up being very hungry that night and snacking on leftovers I had made the night previously.Super disappointing, would strongly suggest another ramen place in the city, especially when there are so many.",0
This restaurant is really cute and the service was great! I got the breakfast quesadilla and it was really tasty with a side of chips and salsa. We were able to make a reservation on yelp which was helpful. When I got there - I was seated immediately. The staff greeted us and catered to our needs. I enjoyed this meal and would come again to try something else!,1
"I first had Ippudo when I was in Taiwan visiting family, and it was then deemed my most favorite Ramen shop in the world. Obviously, when I saw that NYC had a couple of locations, I had to visit. I got the Shiromaru Motoaji with pork, tamago (soft boiled egg), and with the Tokyo thick wavy noodles. Everything was delicious; however, I was disappointed that the tamago was overcooked a little too much. I'd probably try another dish the next time I visit as I think the other Ramen dishes have more special aspects as the Shiromaru Motoaji is your basic beginner Ramen to Ippudo (probably, just my opinion!)",0
Came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday party. Showed up around midnight and there was no line. It was pretty packed inside and the DJ music was pretty good (fun 70s and 80s mix) but 2 bartenders for a Saturday night? Really? This is NYC. You're better than that. Pregame elsewhere then come here to dance.,0
"I came with John and we ordered 7 dishes. Out of the 7 we only thought 2 were really amazing (duck breast and the tuna ceviche). I don't even remember the rest. A katsu dish, some other things? Again, not very memorable. We ordered a cocktail each and I got an extra sake and the total price for the two of us was $211 which I found to be incredibly reasonable. Our waitress was super cool, friendly, and super cute! But I'm not coming back here. I didn't really find anything fusion that would bring me back. Again, 2 out of 7.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The waitress was attentive and polite, and the food was delicious. I especially liked the blackened catfish, which was cooked to perfection. The wild rice was also a great addition to the dish. The atmosphere was very relaxed and pleasant, and the music was not too loud. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",1
"I had been really excited to go here for a while, sadly it just didn't live up to expectations for me. Nothing was terribly bad about it, but nothing super memorable either. I had farmhouse popover which was a bit bland and overly heavy. Too pricey for the quality IMO",0
"I had not been back to NYC since covid hit so going back to La Masseria was a treat. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice lunch. Service was cordial as usual. I didn't realize it was restaurant  and it just so happened I liked their offerings. My husband went for the regular menu. We aren't ""price complainers"" but I will add that prices have definitely gone up in the city. Luckily, the food was good. Appetizers:Eggplant parmMozzarella rollantine  with marinated eggplant  Entrees;SwordfishSalmon with mustard sauce and zucchini Dessert:CheesecakeLa Masseria is still a good stop in midtown for solid Italian cuisine.",0
Came here for dinner with a group of my friends. We were seated almost immediately. The staff was so nice & accommodating. Our water cups were always being refilled and the drinks were brought out very quickly. Our waitress gave us great advice on what to order. The food was delicious. Would definitely be back in the near future,0
"Surprised to find the rating so low on Yelp, but I am a very huge fan of Zai Lai. Zai Lai was one of the vendors that came to my company a few days ago, and I was very blown away by the flavor profile of their food. Me and my coworkers all agreed Zai Lai is, by far, one of the best vendors we've had come to our company. We had a few options between their AMA, AYI, and MAMA rice bowls. I don't remember which one is which, but I opted for their eggplant veggie bowl, and got cabbage and mustard greens as well. It complimented my dish nicely, and it was true to the Asian flavors I am accustomed to. I wanted to try their pork bun, but didn't want to seem too greedy, I'll have to pay a visit to their storefront soon!",0
"Like a family restaurant.  I love the desserts best.  But if I go back, I will definitely have the mussels as my main course and the roasted asparagus parmigiana.  The Alfredo Fettuccini is also delicious but very large portion. I actually like their house wine.  I just came back from Europe and that is how light I want my red wine to be.  We got a carafe.The veal chops was good but very tough meat which I do not understand why.  The flavor of the sauce was fine.The is osso-bucco was very tender and the bone marrow delicious.  A bit too much sauce though.",0
I had a great time at Sola Pasta Bar! The outdoor seating was really cute and the staff was very safe with proper distances between tables. The red wine was delicious and the burrata appetizer was amazing. The portion size was perfect and it paired really well with my wine. I would definitely come back here. It was one of the best Italian places I've been to in the city.,1
"I had a great experience at the Marriott Essex's new restaurant! The staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was good and decently priced. I was really excited to dine on site, and I was not disappointed. The window seat was a great spot!",1
"Hanbat Restaurant is a great place to go for a cold November night. The interior is warm and welcoming, and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the Soon Doo Boo Chi Gae as my entree, and it was a big, steaming bowl of perfection! The dish was spicy and delicious, and everyone in my party enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend Hanbat Restaurant to anyone looking for a great restaurant experience in the area.",1
"I had a really negative experience at this restaurant. The decor is really fun and the staff is friendly, but the food was disappointing. We ordered a pre-fixe menu and were not told about this beforehand. We were also rushed and our plates were still unfinished when the bill came. The total cost of our dinner was much higher than we anticipated, and it was really strange that other servers were coming up to our table asking for our money after we paid. Overall, this was a really unpleasant experience and I would not recommend this restaurant.",1
"The BBQ chicken sandwich at Ritual was pretty good! The chicken was crispy and juicy, and the coleslaw was tasty. The only issue was that the bread was super soggy and fell apart while eating it. However, the wet napkins came in handy and made the sandwich a lot more enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend this sandwich.",1
"*3.5 stars round down to 3*The idea of a ""Steakeasy"" inside of Mel's Burger Bar really attracted me to want to try & Son. The steakeasy is in the back of the restaurant on the main floor. It's a cozy room with a few tables.For the food, we got the fixed menu and got Caesar salad, the steak, and two sides (Mac and cheese and creamed spinach). I thought the steak was OK, not the best I've ever had but still good; the Mac and cheese was DELICIOUS (definitely recommend) and I liked the creamed spinach too.Lastly, for dessert we got the cheesecake. The cheesecake is what is bringing this review down to 3 stars. It tasted so oddly sour, and when we asked our waitress about it she said the chefs were trying out something new and are adding more lemon or something. Very odd and definitely didn't taste right.I liked the ambiance and we were lucky to get a booth for the two of us.",0
"Overall, I thought the food was pretty good - especially the braised beef noodle soup. However, I wasn't as impressed with some of the dishes as my sister was. The crab wontons were good, but I found them a bit too filling. The scallion pancake was also good, but I thought it could have been a bit crisper. The crab soup dumplings were also very good, but I thought the soup was a bit too diluted. The service was friendly and attentive, and the restaurant had a nice and comfortable seating space. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",1
"I met up with a group of friends. It didn't take long to get our table. Just had to have all the party present. This place is clearly popular but it is huge and was packed with people. Our server Shon, was friendly and helpful about questions with menu items. I ordered the sticky chicken fingers and yellow rice. That rice was looking so good on other's plates in the restaurant. My friends who ordered appetizers or salad got their food first which was fine. Then shortly after all the other food came out. It was a lot of food. I loved the flavor to the sticky fingers and the rice was good without adding anything to it Sorry that I didn't take a photoS of my food. The food was good just check it out. I would definitely explore the menu more next time in town. My only drawback was the check situation. We all had so many things on the order and one check so we had to break it up so many ways to pay. I will go back to visit soon.",0
"The frozen dumplings here keep me alive. In my opinion, this is the best cheap dumpling spot in lower Manhattan. The skins are thin and crisp up perfectly when fried and they're amazingly greasy. However, I think what really set these dumplings apart is the texture of the filling. The meat isn't ground into a paste instead it seems like it's just chopped up very small and the ginger is diced into little cubes. The crunch of the ginger creates such a pleasant bite. They obviously know what they're doing here, and at 10 for $3 you really can't do any better for a quick snack on the LES",0
"The Egg Shop is a decent spot for a quick bite, especially if you're looking for something hearty like an egg sandwich. However, the prices can be a bit steep, and the sandwiches can be a bit small. The brunchkins are also a good option if you're in the mood for something sweet.",1
"Yi Ji Shi Mo Noodle Corp is one of my favorite Chinatown hole-in-the-walls for delicious, small portions of rice rolls. The wait times can be long, but it's definitely worth it - especially for the delicious shrimp and dried shrimp rice rolls. I would definitely recommend trying out their other dishes as well, especially the curry fish balls.",1
"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. I ordered pasta and found a long black hair in it after eating only three bites. The waiter accused me of planting it and then said we did it because of some publicity the restaurant had. I explained that I was from out of town and didn't know what he was talking about. Neither did my family who lives here. He just laughed and said a few words I won't repeat and told us to leave. I googled the place later and I see what he meant but I don't care about politics, I care about a good meal at a good price! This is not a place I will return to.",1
"My coworkers and I came here for lunch as it was one of the fewer restaurants we found that offered reservations for large parties.I tried the chips and guacamole and ended up ordering the ropa vieja, which was like a light beef stew of shredded beef pieces. It was served with beans and rice. The chips were okay but they were nothing compared to what you could get on the west coast. The same could have been said about the ropa vieja, it tasted rather bland and boring. I didn't bother eating much of the rice or beans, the beans were almost completely flavorless.Definitely a pass for me, the food just wasn't good enough.",0
"Late review but def a fan.I doubt they still do it but when I went earlier in the year they had a special of Oreo French toast and it was bomb.It was super soft and yummy and it was wildly sweet like I thought it would be. The portion was also insanely huge and I couldn't finish.The place is big but I noticed they do get packed very quickly, I wouldn't mind coming back for lunch or dinner. Our server was super friendly and that def helped make the experience more pleasant esp when they got busy. you didn't feel like you were just a table.",0
"Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. The patio was a nice bonus in the morning and the decor was really clever. The only downside is that the drink orders were a bit confusing and the ginger in the Liquid Vitality shot was a bit overpowering for some. The main dish we ordered was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it to Vegetarians/Vegans looking for a good introduction to the genre.",1
"I had a great time at BoCaphe, the new location in Chelsea. The brunch spot is really cute, and the menu looks really approachable if you're not familiar with Vietnamese food. I ordered the pho with meat on the side, and I was really happy with my meal - though they did stack the meat bowl directly on top of the soup toppings, which I wasn't a huge fan of. I like having the veggies on a separate plate so I can dump it all directly into my bowl. Overall, the bowl of pho was very filling, and the noodles had a good texture and the broth was nice and hot, if a little plain. I would definitely come back!",1
"The Texas Wrangler burger is definitely the star of the show at this small, shareable restaurant. The beef is juicy and flavorful, and the toppings - bacon, onion, and cheese - add just the right amount of richness. The only downside is that the brisket is dry and the beef bacon is a bit bland - but overall, the meal is well worth the wait.",1
"Restoration Hardware Designers is a great place for drinks and ambiance, but the food just isn't that great. The mashed potato side should be called butter soup and the service is pretty bad.",1
"I recently visited A La Turka, and I have to say that the food was really good! However, the service was not so great. I had to wait quite a while for my food, and the waitstaff was not very attentive. However, the food was worth the wait. The beef kebab and chicken kebab were both delicious, and the appetizer cigar boregi and fried calamari were also very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
If you're looking for a unique and fun experience that beats the usual restaurants in NYC I highly recommend Grand Banks! You're literally dining on the boat that's docked at the pier near Tribeca/Fidi with wonderful views of NJ and Lower Manhattan. Coming here for happy hour drinks and dinner is the move but brunch is also lovely. They have a wide selection of oysters to choose from and the drinks are always flowin' creating a great time! Personal recommendation for the lobster roll if you're eating here.,0
"Ramen Ya is a great place for a quick, delicious bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth is rich and flavorful. The only downside is that the restaurant can be a bit noisy, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for some ramen.",1
"I was really happy with my meal at this restaurant! The counter is a little high, but it was definitely worth it for the great food. The ramen was perfect with the perfect amount of spice - I didn't need to add any hot pepper to it. The egg was also amazing, cooked to perfection and just salty enough. The noodles were also straight, which is my preferred style, but all in all, this was a great restaurant! I would definitely come back here if I'm hungry.",1
I stopped in at this small Greek restaurant for a quick bite to eat and was really pleased with the outdoor seating and quick service. I ordered a lamb gyro and was really impressed with the amount of white sauce the dish came with. The gyro was about $10 with tax which is about average for the area. I would definitely recommend this place for takeout or for ordering food in.,1
I had a great time at this restaurant! The service was wonderful and our server always made sure we had water and was very attentive and fun. The food was also great. I loved the baked crab roll and the coconut ceviche. The dan dan noodles were also good. I only took off one star because I thought the sushi was a bit bland. But overall I had a great time and I'm definitely going to come back.,1
"I was hungry for curry today.  Searched and it's the closest one with high review. Guess what? This order:Basic rice+ Chicken cutlet + 5 Pieces of Fried Squid ( very salty ) costed me almost $33+ Tax. I like Curry, specially it says "" Japanese Curry "", no offense, but this curry definitely NOT Japanese style, it tasted watering and salty, not much Curry flavor in it( a little bit ). The waitress gave me the bill and wrote Cash, I asked if it Cash Only place, it ended up that the waitress said she prefer cash. Lol. I was almost ready to offer wash dishes for them. Cuz I didn't have much cash on me today. Anyways. Everyone is different. For me, I don't think this is a Japanese Curry place.",0
"I was excited to try Rake, as it has plenty of positive reviews. However, the food was way too salty for my taste. The udon was my favorite dish - it was soft, chewy, and had a good soup. The vegetable gyoza was also great - with a thin chewy skin. The service was friendly and attentive, and I appreciate the water refill. Overall, I had a decent experience, but I would not return.",1
"Atlas Kitchen is a great place to take your Chinese parents! The chicken with dried chili was my favorite dish, and the soup broth was perfect to balance out the fried dishes. I'm excited to come back and try more dishes!",1
"I really wish this place had happy hour bc I'd be coming here weekly for their espresso martini. I know everyone raves about the margaritas and they were also good (especially the spicy one) but the mezcal espresso martini might just be my favorite drink in the city right now. Food wise everything was solid, the only thing that blew me away was the mushrooms. They were so tender and crispy and perfectly paired with the acidic salsa verde. Those mushrooms on a taco would be killer. For dessert, even though the churros looked impressive, I was a bigger fan of the Tres Leches Cake which had a such a subtle sweetness to it. It left me going back for more bites than I thought I would. The only reason this place doesn't get more love from me is the $$$. The starting price for drinks is $17 and while that fits in with other restaurants in this location, I just don't think it's fully justified. If they had a happy hour I'd be all in.",0
"I have no idea why this place is so popular, the service is lousy and the food is bad.

When we arrived, we were quickly shown to our table. The waiter/server was very condescending to all the women in my party. When my mother asked about the preparation of a dish, he was nasty and condescending. When she asked if they could add something, he had to ""mansplain"" to her why it was wrong when we have gone to far better restaurants that prepared their food that way. 

We asked what was in the green salad, he said ""green salad."" Thank you for being completely useless. He also gave my daughter a hard time for not finishing something her plate. And he wasn't joking.... She got very upset.

Anyhow, we had:- Stuffed Artichoke - very good- Ravioli - my daughter liked it- Spaghetti and meatballs - not great, needed salt- Eggplant Parm - bland, needed salt - Cod Fish Special - inedible, when we returned it, the waiter was mumbling under his breath.

I will absolutely not come back nor would I recommend.",1
yummy. great value. have never seen so many actual japanese people in a restaurant at once in nyc,0
"The drinks were great, but the food wasn't as good as I had hoped. The variety of tacos was a big draw for me, but they were on the small side and the value wasn't great. We ended up going to the Thai restaurant down the street because we were still hungry. If I were to come back, I would consider just getting drinks and eating somewhere else.",1
I should have listened to the ratings on this place - the burgers were really dry and the service was really poor. The food we ordered wasn't all that great either - most of it didn't have much taste. I wouldn't recommend this place.,1
"We had dinner here tonight after seeing all the great reviews. First, the menu was amazing. There were so many things we wanted to try. My wife wanted the short rib, and I wanted the tuna steak; however, knowing they make their own pasta, we both felt obligated to go that direction. She had the gnocchi with Gorgonzola and walnuts, while I went with the lasagna. The first surprise was the size of the dishes. I guess I just kind of took it for granted, but I assumed the portions would be larger. My lasagna was slightly bigger than a deck of cards, and the gnocchi looked to be in a 6-8"" dish. Ok, no worries. Treat it like a filet and eat it slow. Savor every bite. The lasagna flavor was really good. The lighter vodka cream sauce worked wonderfully, and really brought out the taste of the pasta. The gnocchi itself was fantastic. The Gorgonzola and walnuts didn't really do much for the flavor, but it was fine. We had a couple of glasses of the Pinot Noir, which were both quite good as well. Service overall was prompt, courteous, and consistent.",0
"The guac and chips are worth it! I had to get these as lunch one time because it was so so so good! The food was excellent, including the street corn and quesadillas. They prepared it in a timely fashion and the staff were so kind.10/10",0
"My wife, cousin and I visited The Nugget Spot today (Sunday) around 2:00pm. It was busy. All of the seats and open table spaces were taken. However, we were able to find a nice spot once we ordered our food.My wife and I ordered the Skinny Nugs with Mambo Sauce and Cheese N' Chong with Ranch respectively. My cousin ordered the ""Regs"" with Smokin' J's BBQ sauce with a side of cajun fries.The first bites of the Cheese N' Chong were delicious, especially with the ranch. I didn't get tired of the flavor. However, the Skinny Nugs got boring after the first nugget. The description of the Skinny Nugs says it is marinated with cajun. I didn't taste any cajun on the nuggets. It tasted plain. The sauce was good though. The ""Regs"" was good with the BBQ sauce. I think it would have been good without the sauce because it was fried, so it was crunchy on the outside while the meat was juicy on the inside. Lastly, the cajun fries were SO salty. We didn't even finish the fries because it was salty. We actually think they missed the cajun from the Skinny Nugs and put it in the fries on accident lol. Customer service was good! They were very insightful and friendly.",0
"The scallion pancakes were decent, calamari was good but the dish was a bit small with 6 pieces of calamari (I liked the peppers mixed in there though!), mapo tofu could have been better, and the big disappointment was the Changsha spiced chicken. 

The calamari was a good start, but the chicken was the real letdown. The chicken was very dry and lacked flavor. The peanuts and red peppers were a nice touch, but they didn't really add anything to the dish. The dish was also quite small, which was disappointing. Overall, I may come back if I were going with a group of friends, but this wouldn't be my first pick of a Chinese restaurant - go to Chinatown and you will get better food for less, and more quantity too!",1
"My cousin and I randomly decided to step in since we had business to attend to next door and just wanted a quick meal. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a grand albeit empty space (was a Monday afternoon around 3 PM). The decorations as well as the building itself was a bit antiquated. However, many of the workers were just standing around and were very friendly and warm in greeting us and welcoming us to the restaurant. We were taken to seats right away and had our orders taken and food brought out very quickly - it was honestly pretty impressive.  I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup which had a very strong yet yummy flavor; however, it was just slightly too oily for me and also did not have much variety of ingredients in it apart from thick cuts of meat and some bok choy. I would have liked some other ingredients in there to give it some better texture. Additionally, I do have to note though that the noodles were so delicious - well cooked and I love the thicker curly noodles. My cousin got the mixed seafood noodles and I feel like I liked that dish more than the one I got. Flavor was pretty good and had a great mix of seafood varieties. We also shared a plate of stir fry pea sprouts which were good but fairly average. All in all, food was not that bad and was a great place to have a quick lunch.",0
"Still love the burgers here and won't subtract from the five stars, but was disappointed they no longer have their bone marrow appetizer (at the moment). Seems they changed and downsized their menu after reopening due the pandemic. Also did not like the fact that the hostess tried to seat us at the worst table right by the door with a cold draft coming in every few minutes when the whole restaurant was empty at 5 pm! Also hated the Oreo pie dessert we ordered. Tasted like melted birthday candles, do not order it.",0
"I have a profound appreciation for Italian food, therefore it was mandatory to visit the most highly rated italian restaurant tucked in West Village on my NYC trip. The Chitarra Alla Carbonara and fettucine tartufo were perfectly al dente but extremely cheesy and heavy. A very instagramable restaurant but I think the pasta is mid at most.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant, the atmosphere and staff were great. However, the dishes were just on par given the plethora of Italian options in the city. My average on the food was 3.75 / 5 only because I've had so much better of each at different places and nothing in particular stood out. I got the lasagna and was satisfied with the portion and ingredients but it felt like de javu of eating this elsewhere. I felt the same way - and I'm not saying they're not great Italian, because they are. It's just that in a city with so many Italian options I'd want to come back for something I can't live without. My favorite part of the meal was the chocolate covered ice cream sliced into pieces.",1
"Overall, I wasn't impressed with Mr Bing. The General Tso chicken rice bowl didn't taste that great and it was a bit on the small side. I would eat it again, but I wouldn't pay the full price they charge.",1
"Got delivery via DoorDash.  These guys make ONE item, a tonkotsu ramen.  (Actually they make a vegetarian ramen as well which I also ordered and it was tasty too.)So you know their one item better be damn good - and it is.  The broth is amazing - flavorful, ""bone-y"", and not that greasy at all.The pork slices are amazingly tender and pure perfection - perfect mix of fattiness (ie. not overly fatty).Pro tip: when they ask your preferred spiciness level (0-10), pick a lower level so you can taste the broth more.  I picked 3/10 and regretted it because it ended up a tad too spicy.  When the broth is this good, don't need to obscure the taste with spiciness.They also sell a pre-packaged ramen you can cook at home, but it's a similar price point so the freshly made one is a much better deal.",0
"Such a great brunch spot in the Soho area with great food and service! With so many restaurants in the Soho area, can I just say how much I appreciate the quality and classiness of this one. My partner and I had made a last minute reservation on a Saturday afternoon following the brunch rush. When we got there, it was still quite busy but we were able to get our seat promptly after showing our vaccine cards. Our host and waitress were super friendly and helpful during our time there. Not only did they make great recommendations, they also were swift in bringing out the food and making sure our dine in experience was satisfying. Moving on... I really liked how shareable the food portions were. We had gotten the vanilla bean french toast, deviled eggs and potato fries to share. The french toast was so fluffy, moist, authentically-flavored and not overwhelming with each bite. The strawberry and banana were also very fresh. Moreover, the deviled eggs were also packed with seasoning and just so delicious. Love the addition of pickles and parsley on top. Also added the cucumber ginger ale and agave lemonade which were both very refreshing. Both dishes and drinks had great presentation and taste! Our total came out to be ~$60 including tips for two. Overall, I highly recommend getting your brunch cravings at Jane! :)",0
We had the Jamon Serrano and Lamb Meatballs with a bottle of wine. We were not impressed with our waitress. She didn't check on us often and when she did it was only to see if we wanted to order more food. Our tab was considerably higher than the quantity and quality of food we ordered and received. Overall it was a good ambiance and time-- but hard to say I would come back here anytime soon.,0
"Decent bubble tea although but the most authentic and generic but usually can't go wrong with tea based. Friendly staff and a little line but really fast. Seats and tables around and upstairs, along with a restroom downstairs. Bao by Kaya is located closer to the back on the right side of Urbanspace. A couple different choices for gua bao, sides and some beverages. Apple Sidra is my childhood favourite and the only pop I drink, other than root beer. I had the Peking Duck Bao and the Pork Belly Bao. The meat is braised and cooked extremely well. Soft, flavourful, just perfect. The gua bao itself is just alright. The authentic Taiwanese ones are a bit more firm and like the skin of the gua bao feels stretchier (although you can't actually stretch it)..people who have had it will know what I'm talking about. This one is just soft so the sauce makes it slightly soggy faster and the moment I picked my gua bao to eat, which was like 3mins after I got it..it just fell apart. Authentic ones never do that. Doesn't bother me too much and doesn't change the flavour but the texture is just slightly different from what I grew up on and what I expected. Popcorn chicken is a bit dry and doesn't have that authentic Taiwanese popcorn chicken smell, and usually it's really juicy. Tastes good overall and I don't mind coming back to eat if I was around and hungry but need something quick. It's just not a place I'm willing to travel all the way for and it's not going to be my go to spot.",0
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The Tahini Dream appetizer was really good, and the Pomegranate Lemonade was really refreshing. The service was great and the process for ordering was easy. I will definitely be back!",1
"I had a great experience at this restaurant! The service was great and the food was delicious. I recommend trying the M&M pancakes - they're definitely worth it! Overall, I had a really enjoyable time and I'm looking forward to coming back soon.",1
"The Chicken Momos are the real deal! They're crispy and savory, and the dipping sauces are perfect. The wait was a bit long, but well worth it.",1
"I had a great time at this restaurant! The food was rich and well priced, and it came out quickly. The drinks were strong and tasted good. The only complaint I have is that this random girl (not staff) from the bar kept coming to our table and we clearly were just being polite and didn't want to talk to her but the staff did nothing and didn't kick her out despite multiple tables having this incident with her. However I know that isn't a common occurrence. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",1
"The ambiance and decor of OBAO is absolutely lovely. The staff is patient and very accommodating. They also have pretty solid happy hour deals.I ordered a bun bo hue and it was pretty average. I found the broth to lack a bit of a lemongrass kick that I was anticipating. There was enough heat in the dish, just not enough lemongrass in my opinion. They're very generous with the meat in the dish though ^__^ The banh Mis looked really good.",0
"I came to this restaurant after the pride parade and it was a great time. The beers were cold and I tried the fries - they were oddly shaped, but they tasted good. My friends got the cheese burgers and they said they liked them a lot. I don't eat beef, but I'll definitely come back to try their sandwiches.",1
"Where to begin.First off the service here is very good and the main reason I bumped this review to 3 stars.The hostess greeted me and directed me to my table and gave us menus and a wine list while we waited. We had a large group as it was my grandmas 90th birthday dinner. They also immediately gave us water.The waiter also was very good throughout the meal and service changed silverware and cleared when everyone was finished which I very much appreciated.I had very high hopes for this place being $$$ and written up in the times. For the first course I had the peekytoe crab appetizer with cherry tomatoes while almost everyone else at the table ordered french onion soup and my aunt ordered escargot.My crab appetizer was refreshing but very tiny. My aunt didnt care for the escargot since they lacked garlic, everyone else enjoyed their french onion soup which they thought was pretty good.For entree I had the salmon along with my grandfather. Everyone else either had the special peking style duck or the regular duck. One person had the branzino. My sisters boyfriend enjoyed his branzino. The birthday girl and others who ordered the special duck all thought it was ok but was overcooked and was not worth the $43 price tag. The people who ordered the menu duck were more pleased and the duck was moister. I thought my salmon was cooked ok but lacked a crispy skin which I was not happy about. My grandfather also thought it was just alright.For dessert we had a cookie plate, floating islands, a souffle and the sorbet. The best by far was the floating island. Everything else was just ok. The acoustics here are terrible. We could hardly here the person next to is talk when the restaurant was full. When it was half empty we could hear the person next to us but not 2 ppl down. If you want a quiet place this is not the spot.Overall we tried it but will not be back.",0
"Not worth the hype. decor is thoughtful, there is hindi written everywhere and the dish-ware is pretty and detailed. But, while the menu has listed some good items, the execution is mediocre (not very flavorful) and the dishes aren't worth the price (to expensive for the taste & quality). It would be a better bar with small plates option vs. A restaurant. Cocktails are well thought out, but a warning to non-drinkers - SOME MOCKTAILS HAVE THE SAME NAME AS COCKTAILS. SPECIFY MOCKTAIL WHEN ORDERING. this is a big one for me because people are non drinkers for an array of reasons and ending with a cocktail when you don't drink, could be horrible. This ruined our evening. Definitely would not recommend you rush out to GupShup - but if you do decide you want to go, make sure you have a reservation. Some things to know: they have a table turn over time this is the first thing the host will tell you (90 minutes and you have to give the table back). No one walks you to your table, your plates are not replaced between courses, so you keep the same plate the whole time, the water refills are aggressive and they come up will consistently and interrupt your meal to ask if you want water. overall it feels more like fast food dining than ""fine dining"" which when you're paying that much - it should feel more refined. And a heads up: they do run your card AT the table - which puts you on the spot to tip and then you have to ask for a print out to review everything post tip.",0
"Del Posto is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in New York City. The food was amazing and the service was top-notch. We made a reservation three weeks in advance and got a 7:30pm reservation for 2, which was great because it allowed us to come on a Friday night at a normal time.

The captain's menu (8 courses) with wine pairings was a lot of fun. The chef chose the menu for us, which was great because we didn't know what to expect and tried a bunch of different things from the menu. The courses were: arctic char 3 ways, vitello tonnato, liguini alle vonghole, agnolotti di maile, prosciutto wrapped sea bass, pork with sage pesto, blue cheese, and blood orange merengue. All of these dishes were incredible - my favorites were definitely the pastas. The only dish I didn't thoroughly enjoy was the merengue....just because I don't like blood orange.

The wines were all very unique and unexpected. Such a fun dinner with incredible service. Can't wait to come back!",1
"I had a lot of fun at this restaurant, but I think I might have overhyped it a bit. The atmosphere was great and it was quite a lively fine dining noise level. The servers were gracious and introduced each dish. The dishes themselves were good. They just weren't exemplary. Worth a visit for restaurant week's deals, but I'm not sure I would pay it a visit normally. The bathrooms were really nice, too!",1
"Great decorations, very poor service. I'm not one to complain too much about service especially because I know how hard service people work. When we were seated, no one came to our table for at least 20 mins. Not even a glass of water. When the water did come out, one of the glasses was broken and after telling the waiter and a waitress about it, they ignored us and didn't replace the water until the end of our meal. After ordering our drinks, it also took another 20 mins to arrive. The food was also mediocre. Definitely would not recommend coming here for food. The quesadilla was dry but thank god they had some guacamole because it was not worth $17. The sandwiches were decent and I think just about the only items on the menu that was worth it. The pizza was also just regular flatbread, sauce and cheese. When asking for a to go box, we still waited another 10 mins after we already paid for the check.I would say that the host made the night. He was very kind and offer to take our pictures. He was very patient and considerate.",0
"So bad and overpriced. Everything (except the fries) was bland, especially the fish in the fish and chips and the fish tacos. $18 for two fish tacos that are way better and way cheaper across the street at Mexicue.",0
"Club A is one of those restaurants that makes you feel like you're getting a special treat. Every customer is greeted by name, and the staff are friendly and professional. The decor is luxurious but not gaudy, and the steaks are absolutely sublime. The wine list is impressive, with both wines of incredible value and wines of incredible note. The mini beer shot is definitely worth a shot. Overall, Club A is a great place to go for a special occasion or just to relax and enjoy a delicious steak.",1
"Presentation: The packaging for takeout is great and looks cute. They used a wood box packed with a cute Japanese-style bento bag, which is perfect for a picnic.Taste: We ordered the Kaisen Don and Bara Chirashi. The portion for the Kaisen Don is big, with at least five types of sashimi and two pieces for each. The Bara Chirashi is okay. The topping is a mixture of salmon, tuna, eggs and salmon roe. We don't like the fishy taste of the salmon roe. And since we were given only one pack of soy sauce and we used it all for the Kaisen Don, it made the Bara Chirashi taste a bit bland. Service: The service is okay. We waited for about 15mins to get our food after we ordered.",0
"Now I'm jaded by the perfection of my experience here and nothing else will compare. Superb dining experience in all aspects. We are trying to support local restaurants in this period but also in times like this an experience such as the one we shared at Daniel gives us hope NYC is still alive and will be well with a new normal. We chose to sit outside and chose Daniel for no special occasion but to celebrate life. Every single moment was on point. The outside dining cabanas are the best in the city and each have their own space heaters and curtains that close for privacy. So lovely decorated and they gave me a velvet foot stool for my purse.The service was friendly but professional and impeccable and always on time. We never felt rushed and were even presented glasses of water with the check. Also the staff has really cool chic uniforms. The crowd is diverse and fun. Social Distancing was practiced. The food was perfectly prepared in taste, portion and presentation. I have food allergies and they were very accommodating to my requests. I had the baby lettuce salad and Sasso Chicken with mashed potatoes and my friend had the arugula salad and Cod. We had the chocolate tort for desert and it was sprinkled gold and was the creamiest most delicious desert I ever ate. Our drinks were tops and so is the wine list. Wonderful meal! Next month is my Birthday so I hope to go back to eat inside and enjoy the exquisite decor. There were tables by the bar and a few stools where people were waiting.They took temperatures entering and required masks entering and took all the Covid precautions. I felt safe and protected.Merci beacoup Daniel! Stellar job!",0
"We tried Tibetan cuisine for the first time and we were not disappointed. The service was nice and our waitress did a great job of being welcoming and helpful. From the reviews I gathered, it seems that orders might take a while to arrive, but that wasn't the case for us. We got our Momos (Tibetan dumpings) of the non-veg variety and our entrees arrived shortly after. I do wish that the entrees had taken longer to arrive because some of the dumplings are a bit soupy, but overall they are pretty good when hot. The colder dumplings are not as appealing. Rozena's soupy flat noodles with vermicelli and beef was a sizeable portion and quite tasty. The flat noodles have a rice cake texture and these are accompanied by vermicelli too. The stir fry noodles with lamb was a bit oily for my taste but otherwise it was tasty. The price point is well justified and considering the dishes are affordable and the location is midway between work and home, I might go there more often!",1
"Ippudo is a great place to try Japanese cuisine, but I wasn't thrilled with my experience here. The original ramen was bland and very average, wasn't a fan of how the the pork hirata were seasoned, and the hamachi carpaccio was missing the ingredient that makes something taste ok vs. great. I think the American expansions lost sight of its Japanese roots. I would recommend many of the other delicious and authentic Japanese spots in NYC instead.",1
"Lola Taverna is a beautiful restaurant with great outdoor seating. The service was great and the food was delicious. The only downside was that the serving size of the pita that came with the dips was rather stingy. Otherwise, this was a great restaurant.",1
